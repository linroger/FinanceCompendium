## State of the Economy Today
- Unemployment pretty low
- Middling GDP growth
- Inflation back down to low level
- Strong real wage growth
Economy is doing very well
## Gaining Perspective

One goal of the class:

- Understand better current economic situation
- Ongoing policy debate
- Another goal: Gain a broader perspective
- Recessions and booms more generally
- Long run economic growth / Differences in income across countries
- Inflation / Hyperinflation
- Financial crises
## Great Recession

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/80a0622fa137c82d6bc6724c4d4ec7fa84395258f9d8db7da484eeb2eb152ad8.jpg)

## Policy Response
- Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to zero
- Bush/Obama administrations passed large "fiscal stimulus" bills
- Massive increase of federal deposit insurance
Lehman Brothers let go bankrupt
Large Wall Street ``bailouts' (Fannie Mae, Freddy Mac, AIG, big banks)
## State of Macro Knowledge
- Krugman (2009):
- How did economists get it so wrong? (i.e., how could we let this happen?)
- "mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth"
- "blindness of the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy."
## Great Recession vs. Great Depression
- Christina Romer (Chair, CEA, 2009-2010): "I feel strongly that the shocks that hit the U.S. economy last fall [fall of 2008] were at least as large as those in 1929."
- Household wealth:
-17\% in 2008 vs -3\% in 1929
- AAA-BAA spread:
338bp in Dec-2008 vs. 219bp in Dec-1930

## The State of Macro

Romer, Sep 24 2009:

"The accomplishment of walking the American economy back from the edge of the second Great Depression is real and deserves to be celebrated."

- Krugman, Sep 6 2009:
"It's hard to believe now, but not long ago economists were congratulating themselves over the success of their field."
## Ben Bernanke at Milton Friedman's  $90^{\mathrm{th}}$ Birthday Celebration

"I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."

Ben Bernanke

Chairman of Federal Reserve Board, 2006-2014

[then Governor at Federal Reserve Board]

## Key Questions about Recessions/Crises

Why do they happen?

- Irrational exuberance gone bad?
- Policy mistakes?
- Fundamental "shocks"?
- Perhaps "self-fulfilling prophesies"?
- Can good policy prevent recessions/crises?
What we do about them?
- Major policy responses:
- Monetary policy
Fiscal policy
- Does it make sense to use fiscal stimulus? What kind?
- Does it make sense to "bail out" banks? How? Why?

# How Will the Next 50 Years Compare?
- Bernanke (2013) reading:
- Compares 1963 with 2013
- Most things the same (except internet, cellphones, microwave ovens) (since then, we have social media, ChatGPT)
- Then compares 1913 with 1963
- Fundamental differences (few people had electricity, telephones, cars. No radio, airplanes, antibiotics, etc.)
- Is innovation running out of steam?
- Bernanke doesn't think so.
# Key Questions About Growth:
- Why do growth rates differ so much across countries?
(China grew 3-4 times faster than the U.S. over last decades)
What is the source of economic growth?
(Why are we about 10 times richer than Americans a century ago?)
- Why are some countries 50 times poorer than others?
- How did modern economic growth begin?
- Will it continue?

Old banknotes such as this, once considered near worthless when in circulation, are enjoying a resurgence in value with tourists eager to buy notes as curiosities…. The IMF says the [inflation] rate peaked at the end of 2008 at 500 billion percent.

# Key Questions About Inflation:
- What determines the rate of inflation?
- Why did inflation in the U.S. rise to double digit levels in the 1970’s?
- Why do some countries experience hyperinflations?
- How should a country deal with deflation?
- How costly is inflation (and deflation)?
# How Can This Class Help You Answer Key Questions?
1. We will discuss empirical evidence that may affect your thinking about these issues and we will discuss how to interpret this evidence
2. We will develop theory (i.e., a powerful language) that will help you think about these issues and explain the empirical evidence
# The Interplay of Theory and Facts
Facts help us decide what types of models to construct
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/eaa2106ce379e3cbdd23d29ca5943dec3f19cb94e7ebeeb23b0ae7909b2330a1.jpg)
Theory helps us decide what to measure
# Thinking Like An Economist
1. A correlation does not imply a causal relationship
- Example: Countries with more complex tax systems have higher income per capita
- Example: Teenagers that start to use alcohol later are less likely to have drug problems later in life
2. The power of competition
- Competitive markets lead to an efficient outcome
- Government intervention can be justified by a “market failure”. (What is the market failure?)
# Left Wing Critique
- Mainstream economics is hopelessly biased in favor of the rich and powerful (i.e., capitalists)
- Neoclassical economics is a tool of the powerful to exploit the powerless
# Left Wing Critique
- I have some sympathy for this view
- Models with "perfect markets" are easier to solve
Hence, they are a common benchmark
- Models are meant to be a stylized version of reality, but are often an idealized version of reality
- We use them so much we forget that their conclusions depend on strong assumptions that may not accurately reflect the real world
- Important (but hard) to not let this bias one’s thinking
# Defense of Mainstream Economics
- Left wing critics often have a rosy view of reality:
"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need"
- Basic premise of mainstream economics:
People respond to incentives
# Defense of Mainstream Economics
- Central idea of mainstream economics:
Competition restrains exploitation
- Sometimes competition fails.
- Some economists have too rosy a view of market competition
- But throwing out neoclassical economics is like throwing out the baby with the bathwater
# Lecture 2 Production
Macroeconomics (Quantitative) Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# A Model of Production
- Economists use mathematical models to describe and understand the world
- In this lecture, we take our first steps in this direction
# Simple Canonical Model
- One Market, Supply and Demand:
$$
{ q_{ t } } { = } { a p_{ t } + w_{ t } }
$$
$$
{q_{t}} = {- b p_{t} + p_{t}^{x y z}}
$$
- Two equations look very similar
- Which one is the supply curve?
- If  $a$  and  $b$  are positive, first equation is supply curve because supply curves slope upward
# Components of a Model
1. Endogenous variables
2. Exogenous variables and parameters
3. Equations that relate these variable to each other
# Components of a Model
$$
\begin{array}{l} { q_{ t } } { = } { a p_{ t } + w_{ t } } \\ { q_{ t } } { = } { - b p_{ t } + p_{ t }^{ x y z } } \\ \end{array}
$$
- Endogenous variables:  $p_{t}$  and  $q_{t}$
- Exogenous variables:  $w_{t}$  and  $p_{t}^{xyz}$
- Parameters:  $a$  and  $b$
- If you don't know what the endogenous variables are, you don't know what you are solving for.
# General Equilibrium Model
- In macro, we usually study general equilibrium models
- A model is a general equilibrium model if price and quantity in all markets are endogenous variables
- Today we will study our first general equilibrium model with three markets:
- Labor market, capital market, goods market
# Roadmap
- Simple general equilibrium models will consist of:
- Demand and supply curves for each market
- Important caveat 1: Only relative prices matter
- This implies that we can set one of the prices equal to 1
- We call this the numeraire
- Important caveat 2: Walras' Law
- If all but one market is in equilibrium, then the last one is necessarily also in equilibrium.
- This implies that we only need to write down equations for all but one of the markets
# Roadmap
- To solve a model, you need as many equations as there are endogenous variables
Example: 3 markets (labor, capital, goods)
- How many endogenous variables?
- Five endogenous variables:  $L, w, K, r, Y$ .
- Price of goods is the numeraire
- We will need 5 equations
- E.g.: demand and supply in the labor and capital markets and one more equation to give us output.
# Production Function

We represent production process by a production function:

$$
Y = F (K, L)
$$
- Example: How much ice cream can we make if we have  $L$  workers and  $K$  ice cream machines?
- $Y$ : amount of ice cream produced
- $L$ : Number of workers (or hours of work)
- $K$ : Number of machines (amount of capital)
- Inputs or factors of production: Labor, Capital
# Properties of Production Functions
- What properties should a reasonable production function satisfy?  $Y = F(K, L)$
- Suppose we increase  $L$
- Output increases
- But at a declining rate
- Suppose we increase  $K$
- Output increases
- But at a declining rate
# Properties of Production Functions
- What properties should a reasonable production function satisfy?
- Positive marginal products of factors:
$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial L} \geq 0 \mathrm{an d} \frac{\partial F}{\partial K} \geq 0
$$
- Diminishing marginal products:
$$
\frac{\partial^{2} F}{\partial L^{2}} \leq 0 \mathrm{an d} \frac{\partial^{2} F}{\partial K^{2}} \leq 0
$$

(What about  $\partial^2 F / \partial L \partial K$ ?)

# Cobb-Douglas Production Function
- Most commonly used production function
$$
Y = A K^{a} L^{1 - a}
$$
$$
\frac{\partial Y}{\partial L} = (1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} \geq 0 \mathrm{an d} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial K} = a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} \geq 0
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac{\partial^{2} Y}{\partial L^{2}} = - a (1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a - 1} \leq 0 \mathrm{an d} \frac{\partial^{2} Y}{\partial K^{2}} = - a (1 - a) A K^{a - 2} L^{1 - a} \leq 0 \\ \frac{\partial^{2} Y}{\partial L \partial K} = a (1 - a) A K^{a - 1} L^{- a} \geq 0 \\ \end{array}
$$
# Returns to Scale
- Suppose:
$$
Y = A K^{a} L^{1 - a}
$$
- What happens if we double all inputs to production?
(i.e., both  $K$  and  $L$ )
$$
\begin{array}{l} {F (2 K, 2 L)} = {A (2 K)^{a} (2 L)^{1 - a}} \\ { = } { A 2^{ a } K^{ a } 2^{ 1 - a } L^{ 1 - a } } \\ = 2 A K^{a} L^{1 - a} \\ = 2 F (K, L) \\ \end{array}
$$
- Twice as much of every input yields twice as much output
- Production function is constant returns to scale
# Returns to Scale
- What is it about  $Y = A K^{a} L^{1 - a}$  that implies constant returns to scale?
- Exponents on  $K$  and  $L$  sum to one
- If exponents sum to more than one:
- Increasing returns to scale
- If exponents sum to less than one:
- Decreasing returns to scale
Economically, why should we model production as having constant returns to scale at the aggregate level?
# Replication Argument
- Replication argument:
- If you build two identical factories. You should get twice as much output as from one.
Counter-arguments?
- Fixed factors: Some inputs cannot be doubled. E.g., land.
- Not strictly speaking about the production function itself.
- But has similar implications (diminishing returns to remaining factors)
- Externalities: There may be either positive or negative spillovers between factories.
# Behavior of Firms
- How should we model the behavior of firms?
- Usual assumptions in economics:
- Individuals maximize utility
- Firms maximize profits
- Tricky for firms…. What is a firm?
- Shareholders put up money and "own" the firm
- Managers hired by shareholders
- Employees hired by managers
- Money borrowed from creditors
- Conflicts of interest left and right!!
# Firm's Problem
- Choose how many workers to hire and machines to rent to maximize profits
$$
\max_{K, L} F (K, L) - r K - w L
$$
- Profits are production minus cost of inputs
- We set the price of output to 1 (the numeraire)
- $r$ : rental price of machines,  $w$ : wage of workers
- Firm takes  $r$  and  $w$  as given. Why?
- Competitive markets for labor and capital (Simplifying assumption – left wing critique)
# Firm's Problem: Solution
- How do we go about solving the firm's problem?
$$
\max_{K, L} F (K, L) - r K - w L
$$
1. Choose optimal level of capital
- Maximize profits with respect to  $K$  treating  $L$  as fixed
2. Choose optimal level of labor
- Maximize profits with respect to  $L$  treating  $K$  as fixed
# Firm's Problem: Solution
- We are making use of a simple but powerful mathematical result:
$$
\max_{x, y} f (x, y)
$$ is given by the solution to the following two equations
$$

\frac{\partial f (x , y)}{\partial x} = 0

$$
$$

\frac{\partial f (x , y)}{\partial y} = 0

$$
# Firm's Problem: Solution
$$

\max_{K, L} F (K, L) - r K - w L

$$
- We start by plugging in for  $F(K, L)$ :
$$

\max_{K, L} A K^{a} L^{1 - a} - r K - w L

$$
# Optimal Choice of Capital by Firm
- Differentiate profit function with respect to  $K$  (holding  $L$  constant)
$$

\frac{\partial}{\partial K} A K^{a} L^{1 - a} - r K - w L = a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} - r

$$
- Set this equal to zero to maximize:
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} - r = 0
$$
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = r
$$
# Optimal Choice of Labor by Firm
- Differentiate profit function with respect to  $L$  (holding  $K$  constant)
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial L} A K^{a} L^{1 - a} - r K - w L = (1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} - w
$$
- Set this equal to zero to maximize:
$$ a A K^{a} L^{- a} - w = 0
$$
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$
# Firm's Problem: Solution
- Firm maximizes profits if:
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = r
$$
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$
- Seems a bit inscrutable?
- How can we interpret these conditions?
# Firm's Optimal Choice of Capital
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = r
$$

RHS: Price of capital

LHS:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial K} Y = \frac{\partial}{\partial K} A K^{a} L^{1 - a} = a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a}
$$

LHS: Marginal product of capital

- Optimal for firms to rent capital to the point where the marginal product of capital is equal to price of capital
# Firm's Optimal Choice of Labor
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$

RHS: price of labor (wage)

LHS

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial L} Y = \frac{\partial}{\partial L} A K^{a} L^{1 - a} = (1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a}
$$

LHS: Marginal product of labor

- Optimal for firms to hire labor to the point where the marginal product of labor is equal to price of labor (the wage)
# Firm's Problem
- Maximize profits:
$$
\max_{K, L} A K^{a} L^{1 - a} - r K - w L
$$
- Optimal choice of capital implies:
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = r
$$
- Optimal choice of labor implies:
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$
# Math vs. Economics
- We can derive optimal behavior by firms in two ways:
- Mathematically
- Differentiate profits with respect to capital holding labor fixed
- Differentiate profits with respect to labor holding capital fixed
- By economic reasoning:
- Firm sets MPK equal to price of capital
- Firm sets MPL equal to price of labor
# Firm Behavior
- Optimal choice of capital yields:
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = r
$$
- This equation can be represented graphically by a "curve" in  $(\mathsf{K}, \mathsf{r})$  space
- The curve is all the points in  $(\mathsf{K}, \mathsf{r})$  space that satisfy the equation (for some set values of other variables, i.e.,  $L, A, a$ )
- Why is this curve downward sloping?
- Does this "curve" have a name?
- Demand curve in capital market

# Firm Behavior
- Optimal choice of labor yields:
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$
- This equation can also be represented graphically by a "curve" in (L,w) space
- Curve is all the points in  $(L, w)$  space that satisfy the equation (for some set values of other variables)
- Does this "curve" have a name?
- Demand curve in labor market

# Power of Competition
- We assume labor market is perfectly competitive
- This implies that workers are paid their marginal product
- Workers paid value of what they produce at the margin (value of what last worker produces)
- Why aren't they paid less?
(Why don't firms exploit the workers?)
- Each firm is held in check by competition with other firms in the labor market (if one pays less, another firm will find it profitable to hire away that firm's workers)
# Power of Competition
- But perhaps perfect competition is not a realistic assumption
- Perhaps we only make this assumption because it simplifies the math
- And then we forget that we make it
- And we start to think markets are efficient in the real world
- And we might even forget about the very possibility that markets might not be competitive
Daniel Kahneman called this "theory-induced blindness"
# Completing the Model

We need demand and supply curves for the capital and labor markets + one more equation

We have labor and capital demand

What about labor and capital supply?

- Simplifying assumption: labor and capital supplied inelastically
$$
K = \overline {{K}}
$$
$$
L = \overline {{L}}
$$
# Completing the Model
- Last equation: Something that gives output as a function of other variables
- We can use production function:
$$
Y = A K^{a} L^{1 - a}
$$
# Model
- Five equations:
$$ a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = r
$$
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$
$$
K = \overline {{K}}
$$
$$
L = \overline {{L}}
$$
$$
Y = A K^{a} L^{1 - a}
$$
- Five endogenous variables:  $K, L, r, w, Y$
# An Equilibrium
- In economics, the solution to a model is called an equilibrium
- What happens when things play out in the markets under consideration ("when markets clear")
- Model: System of five equations with five unknowns
- "Solving" the model:
- Solving for endogenous variables as functions only of exogenous variables and parameters
- Rewriting the system with the endogenous variables on one side of the equations and only exogenous variables and parameters on the other side.
# Equilibrium
- "Trivial" solution in our case:
$$
K = \overline {{K}}
$$
$$
L = \overline {{L}}
$$
$$ r = a A \overline {{K}}^{a - 1} \overline {{L}}^{1 - a}
$$
$$ w = (1 - a) A \overline {{K}}^{a} \overline {{L}}^{- a}
$$
$$
Y = A \overline {{K}}^{a} \overline {{L}}^{1 - a}
$$
# Factor Shares

Revenue firms receive is paid out as:

1. Wages to workers
2. Returns to capital
3. Pure profits
- Accounting measures divide revenue up somewhat differently
Firms raise funds through:
- Debt
Equity
- Accounting measures view:
- interest payments as a cost
- Returns to equity as a part of profits
Economics:
- Interest payments on debt a part of returns to capital
- Competitive return on equity part of return to capital
# Labor Share in Our Model
- Labor compensation is  $wL$ . Labor share is  $wL / Y$ .
From labor demand curve we have
$$ w = (1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = (1 - a) \frac{Y}{L}
$$
- Multiplying through by  $L$  yield
$$ w L = (1 - a) Y
$$
- Labor share is  $(1 - a)$
# Capital Share in Our Model
- Capital compensation is  $rK$ . Capital share is  $rK / Y$ .
From the capital demand curve we have
$$ r = a A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = a \frac{Y}{K}
$$
- Multiplying through by  $K$  yields
$$ r K = a Y
$$
- Capital share is  $a$
# Profit Share
- How much of firm revenue is left as profits?
- None!
Why?
- Factor markets are perfectly competitive
- Production function is constant returns to scale
Euler's theorem:
$$
\begin{array}{l} F (L, K) = \frac{\partial F (L , K)}{\partial L} L + \frac{\partial F (L , K)}{\partial K} K \\ Y = w L + r K \\ \end{array}
$$
# Why Cobb-Douglas

Cobb-Douglas is tractable

- Arguably more important is that Cobb-Douglas implies constant factor shares
- Factor share have in fact been remarkably close to constant since WWII

# Is the Labor Share Falling?
- Recent research has argued that apparent fall in labor share is due to mismeasurement
- Labor share using pre-1999 methods has not fallen
- Difference: Reclassification of intellectual property as capital
- But aren't the new methods better?
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/7da9dfd31bc7c42f097348c7519cdd2b0c8182ea2501eeaea50b831739933a0b.jpg)
Figure 5: Economy-Wide U.S. Labor Share
# Is Labor Share Falling?
- Barro (2021): GDP double counts investment – Once when built, again when it yields a service flow
- GDP used for many purposes, including business cycle measurement. Perhaps appropriate for that purpose
We are interested in welfare of workers and owners of capital – How much they can afford to consume
- GDP not appropriate for this because of double-counting
- Owners of capital must maintain capital (can't consume that part)
- Must also build new capital (can't consume that part)
# Is Labor Share Falling?
- Net domestic product (NDP) more appropriate for labor share calculations
- If depreciation rises, difference between GDP and NDP increases
- Role of high depreciation capital has been increasing (e.g., software)
- Gross labor share falling, but not clear share of output available for consumption is falling
# Better and Cheaper Machines?
- One reason why labor share may be falling: better or cheaper machines
- Doesn't work with Cobb-Douglas production function
$$
Y = A (z K)^{a} L^{1 - a}
$$

In this case:

$$ r = a z^{a} A K^{a - 1} L^{1 - a} = a \frac{Y}{K}
$$
$$ r K = a Y
$$
- Labor share independent of  $z$
# More General Production Function
- Turns out to be very knife-edge
- Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) Production function:
$$
Y_{t} = \left[ a \big (A_{K, t} K_{t} \big)^{\frac{\sigma - 1}{\sigma}} + (a - 1) \big (A_{L, t} L_{t} \big)^{\frac{\sigma - 1}{\sigma}} \right]^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma - 1}}
$$
- In this case, labor share is
$$ s_{L, t} = 1 - a^{\sigma} \left(\frac{A_{K , t}}{r_{t}}\right)^{\sigma - 1}
$$
# Labor Share in CES Case
$$ s_{L, t} = 1 - a^{\sigma} \left(\frac{A_{K , t}}{r_{t}}\right)^{\sigma - 1}
$$
- $\sigma$  key parameter. If  $\sigma = 1$  back in Cobb-Douglas case
- $\sigma$  is elasticity of substitution between capital and labor
- If price of capital falls by  $1 \%$ relative to price of labor, quantity of capital used in production increases by  $\sigma \%$ relative to quantity of labor
- This number is 1 for Cobb-Douglas. But that is a special case.
# Labor Share in CES Case
$$ s_{L, t} = 1 - a^{\sigma} \left(\frac{A_{K , t}}{r_{t}}\right)^{\sigma - 1}
$$

$\cdot \sigma > 1$ :

- Increase in  $A_{K,t}$  and decrease in  $r_t$  reduce the labor share (increase the capital share)
- In this case, improvements in capital imply that firms use a lot more capital, increasing the capital share
# Better and Cheaper Machines
- Machines have been getting cheaper ( $r_t$  has been falling)
- Perhaps this is why labor share has been falling?
- Only works if  $\sigma > 1$
- But whether this is the case is not clear.

# Lecture 3

Macroeconomics (Quantitative)

Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Work and Leisure
- Choosing a job/career one of most important decisions we make
- Politics: Jobs, jobs, jobs!!!
- Unemployment extremely serious and frightening risk
- But abstracting from unemployment, more work not always better
- For many their job is a means to an end
Work takes time away from time you have to enjoy fruits of labor
- Important choice: How much should we work?
- We present a model to help us think about this question
# Household Behavior
- Our starting point: People act in a purposeful manner
- How should we "model" purposeful choices by households (people)?
Rational choice model:
- Assume that people have preferences over, e.g., goods and leisure
- Represent preferences by a utility function
- Assume that people maximize utility
- Recognize that people are constrained by the resources they have at their disposal
# Household Utility Function
- Utility over consumption and hours worked:
$$
U (C, H)
$$
- Very "broad brush" model of preferences
- We ignore all the details associated with different types of job and goods, etc.
# Household Utility Function
- For simplicity, we assume separability:
$$
U (C) - V (H)
$$
- $U(C)$  represents utility from consumption of goods
- $V(H)$  represents disutility from supplying labor
- $H$  is hours worked per person.
- Aggregate labor by  $L = N H$  where  $N$  denotes population
- We can "normalize" the size of the population to  $N = 1$  (choice of units, unit coincides with size of population)
# Household Utility Function
- Alternative specification:
- consumption and leisure (Z)
$$
U (C) + V \underbrace {(1 - H)}_{Z}
$$
- Household has time endowment of 1 and leisure of  $Z = 1 - H$
- Here,  $V(1 - H)$  represents utility from leisure
# Household Utility Function
- What properties should  $U(C) - V(H)$  have?
- Household likes consumption:
$$
\frac{d U (C)}{d C} = U^{\prime} (C) > 0
$$
- But at a diminishing rate:  $U''(C) < 0$
- Extra coconut very valuable when you have few coconuts
– Extra coconut not as valuable when you already have many
# Household Utility Function

What about  $V(H)$ ? This is disutility of working

- How about assuming household dislikes working (enjoys leisure):
$$
\frac{d V (H)}{d H} = V^{\prime} (H) > 0
$$
- But is that natural? People are miserable when unemployed.
Work provides people with meaning
- Even if people like their jobs, work yields disutility on the margin
- Household's marginal disutility of working is increasing:
$$
V^{\prime \prime} (H) > 0
$$
# Household Budget Constraint
- Households maximize utility subject to a budget constraint
- Budget constraint:
$$
C = w H + T
$$
- Left-hand side: Sources of spending
- Consumption: C
- Right-hand side: Sources of income
- Labor income:  $wH$
- Other income:  $T$  (gov. transfers, lottery winnings, etc.)
# Household's Problem
- Household's problem is a constrained maximization problem
- Maximize utility:
$$
U (C) - V (H)
$$
- Subject to not violating its budget constraint:
$$
C = w H + T
$$
# Household's Problem: Plug and Chug
1. Plug budget constraint into utility function:
$$
U (w H + T) - V (H)
$$
2. Differentiate with respect to  $H$  and set to zero:
$$ w U^{\prime} (w H + T) - V^{\prime} (H) = 0
$$
3. Use budget constraint to plug  $C$  back into  $U'$
$$ w U^{\prime} (C) - V^{\prime} (H) = 0
$$
4. Rearrange:
$$ w U^{\prime} (C) = V^{\prime} (H)
$$
# Labor-Leisure: Intuition
$$ w U^{\prime} (C) = V^{\prime} (H)
$$
- Straightforward derivation.
- But do you understand what this equation is saying?
- Useful to adopt a variational perspective to build intuition
- Suppose the household is considering working  $H$  hours
- To kick the tires on this choice, suppose it contemplates working a little bit more (or a little bit less)
# Labor-Leisure: Intuition
- Marginal cost of working a little bit more:
- $V^{\prime}(H)$  "utils" per extra hour worked
- Marginal benefit of working a little bit more:
- $w$  coconuts per extra hours worked
- Each of these coconuts is worth  $U^{\prime}(C)$  "utils"
- Overall marginal benefit in "utils" is then  $wU'(C)$  "utils" per extra hour worked
- $U^{\prime}(C)w = V^{\prime}(H)$  says that at the optimum marginal benefit of working more equal to marginal cost of working more
# Labor-Leisure: Intuition
- Suppose the household is supplying very few hours of labor.
- What does this imply about  $U^{\prime}$ ?
- What does this imply about  $V^{\prime}$ ?
- In this situation, we have:
$$
U^{\prime} (C) w > V^{\prime} (H)
$$
- Worker better off if they work more
- Suppose the household is supplying very large number of hours.
- What does this imply about  $U^{\prime}$ ?
- What does this imply about  $V^{\prime}$ ?
- In this situation, we have:
$$
U^{\prime} (C) w <   V^{\prime} (H)
$$
- Worker better off if the work less
# Labor-Leisure: Intuition
- Somewhere in between is a "sweet spot" where a little extra effort neither makes household better nor worse off
- At this point we have:
$$
U^{\prime} (C) w = V^{\prime} (H)
$$

This is the optimum!!

# Units: Utilities versus Coconuts
$$
U^{\prime} (C) w = V^{\prime} (H)
$$
- Units: utils per hour worked
- RHS is "utils per hour worked"  $(V^{\prime}(H))$
- LHS is "coconuts per hour worked"  $(w)$  times "utils per coconut"  $(U^{\prime}(C))$ . Multiplies together these become "utils per hour worked"
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w
$$
- Units: coconuts per hour worked
- RHS: "coconuts per hour worked" (w)
- LSH: "utils per hour worked"  $(V^{\prime}(H))$  divided by "utils per coconut"  $(U^{\prime}(C))$  or multiplied by "coconuts perUtil"  $(1 / U^{\prime}(C))$ . Multiplies to "coconuts per hour worked"
# Household's Problem
- This equation can be graphically represented by a "curve" in (H,w) space
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w
$$

What is the slope of this curve?

- $V'' > 0$ , implies that it is upward sloping in  $(w, H)$  space
- Importantly we are holding C fixed when we graph this curve
- Does this curve have a name?
- Labor supply curve
Real wage, w

- Suppose your wage was temporarily high for one week. How would this affect your labor supply a) I would work more
b) I would work the same amount c) I would work less
# Poll
- Suppose your wage was permanently higher. How would this affect your labor supply a) I would work more
b) I would work the same amount c) I would work less
# Effect of Wage Increase on Labor Supply
# 1. Substitution effect:
- Working more lucrative
- Leisure more "expensive"
- Wage is opportunity cost of leisure
- Households substitute towards lucrative activities and away from expensive activities
- Work more
# 2. Income effect:
- Higher wage means worker is richer
Richer workers chooses more consumption and more leisure
- Leisure is a "normal" good (you buy more of it the richer you are)
- More leisure means less work
- Work less
# Substitution Effect
- Suppose we could vary the wage without effecting consumption
(i.e., very temporary change in  $w$ )
- Increase in wage increases RHS
- Need to increase LHS to balance.
- If  $C$  is constant,  $V^{\prime}(H)$  must rise
- This implies that  $H$  must rise since  $V''(H) > 0$
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w
$$
# Income Effect
- How does an increase in consumption affect labor supply holding wages fixed? (e.g., due to winning the lottery)
$$
\uparrow C \Rightarrow \downarrow U^{\prime} (C) \Rightarrow \uparrow \frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)}
$$
$$
U^{\prime \prime} (C) <   0
$$
- To balance this effect, we must have
$$
\downarrow V^{\prime} (H) \underset {\uparrow} {\Rightarrow} \downarrow H
$$
$$
V^{\prime \prime} (H) > 0
$$
- Thus, the income effect leads to a fall in hours worked
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w
$$
# Increase in the Wage
- Recall that  $C = wH + T$  (in our simple model)
So, we have:
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (w H + T)} = w
$$
- This mean that an increase in the wage has both an income and substitution effect
- $w$  on RHS is responsible for substitution effect
- $w$  on LHS (inside  $U^{\prime}(wH + T)$ ) is responsible for income effect
- Which is stronger?
# Short Run versus Long Run
- For a short run change in wages:
- Effect on lifetime wealth small
- Income effect small
- Substitution effect dominates
- For a long run change in wages:
— Effect on lifetime wealth large
- Income effect substantial
- Not clear whether income or substitution effect is stronger (depends on shape of  $U$  and  $V$ )
# Labor Supply in Practice?
- Two first order facts:
1. Real wages have risen by roughly  $1.5\%$  per year for over 100 years (real wages adjust for changes in prices)
2. Hours worked per worker in the U.S. have declined gradually

# Labor Supply in Practice?
- What do these figures imply about relative size of income and substitutions effects in the long run?
- Income effect slightly larger than substitution
- Common to ignore income effects and assume wage increases will increase labor supply (e.g., tax cuts)
- But income effects are large over the long run!!
# Hours Worked Per Person
- Hours worked per worker have fallen
- But hours worked per person have not
Why might this be?

# Gender Revolution
- Labor force participation rate of men fallen steadily
- Labor force participation rate of women rose rapidly in  $2^{nd}$  half of  $20^{th}$  century
- Changing cultural normal, less discrimination led women to enter labor force
One-time shock that obscured underlying downward trend

# What Do We Learn about the Utility Function?
- Suppose:
$$
U (C) = \ln C
$$
$$
V (H) = - \psi \ln (1 - H)
$$
$$
T = 0
$$
- In this case,  $\frac{V^{\prime}(H)}{U^{\prime}(C)} = w$  becomes
$$
\psi \frac{w H}{1 - H} = w
$$
- Which simplifies to
$$
\frac{H}{1 - H} = \frac{1}{\psi}
$$
- Wage has no effect on labor supply!
- Income and substitution effects exactly equal
This is close to data
What is it about this functional form that yields this result?
It is the  $U(C) = \ln C$  part
So, we learn that perhaps  $U(C) = \ln C$  is a reasonable functional form
# Keynes and Income Effect
- What did Keynes think about the relative strength of the income effect and the substitution effect?
Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren written in 1930
- "Suppose that a hundred years hence we are all of us, on the average, eight times better off in the economic sense than we are to-day." (i.e.,  $2\%$  annual growth)
# Keynes and Income Effect
- Income effect dominant in the long run:
- "Absolute needs … satisfied"
- "prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes" (leisure)
- Main worry "general 'nervous breakdown'"
- "need to do some work … to be contented"
- "Three-hour shifts or a fifteen hour week"
- Clearly, Keynes overestimated the strength of the income effect
# Is Europe in a Depression?

Output per working-age person in Europe  $30\%$  lower than in U.S.

- Prescott: Europe is in a depression
Is this due to major malfunction of economy?
Is it similar to Great Depression of 1930s?

Notes: The table reports percentage differences versus the United States in output per working-age person. Data on output and capital are from the Penn World Tables (version 10.1). Data on hours worked and the population of working age are from the OECD. Working age is defined as age 15 to 65.
# Accounting for Income Levels
- Useful to break income differences into a few components
$$
Y_{i t} = A_{i t}^{1 - a} K_{i t}^{a} H_{i t}^{1 - a} \rightarrow \left(\frac{Y_{i t}}{N_{i t}}\right)^{1 - a} = A_{i t}^{1 - a} \left(\frac{K_{i t}}{Y_{i t}}\right)^{a} \left(\frac{H_{i t}}{N_{i t}}\right)^{1 - a}
$$
$$
\ln y_{i t} = \ln A_{i t} + \frac{a}{1 - a} \ln \frac{k_{i t}}{y_{i t}} + \ln h_{i t}
$$
- Decomposes output per working age person into three factors – 1) Productivity factor, 2) Capital factor, 3) Labor factor
# Accounting for Income Levels
1970:
- Most of difference productivity
- Hours similar to US
2000:
- Most of difference hours
Productivity largely caught up in Germany and France
2015:
- Productivity has fallen off again
- Hours still much lower in France

Figure 13: Employment Rates by Age Relative to the U.S.
# Why Do Europeans Work So Little?
- Differences in preferences and culture
(englightened, women, coordination)
- More generous social safety net (UI, health insurance, etc.) (weak incentives)
Higher minimum wages
- Unions work less - work all, coordination device)
- Labor market regulation (hiring and firing costs)
- Taxes
# Taxes and Europe's "Depression"
- Labor supply is about  $30\%$  lower in France than in the US. Why?
- Student A: Perhaps it is because taxes are so high in France?
- Student B: That is ridiculous! There is no way taxes could matter that much.
- How can students A and B make progress in figuring out who is right?
# Taxes and Europe's "Depression"
- Direct empirical evidence not conclusive since taxes correlated with other factors affecting labor supply
- But can we use theory to help us think about what the size of the effect of taxes on labor supply depends on?
- If so, this will allow us to sharpen the debate
- Then we can argue about the key determining factors and seek out evidence about these factors
# Taxes and Europe's "Depression"
- Let's augment our model of labor supply to include:
- Labor income tax  $\tau_{l}$
- Consumption tax  $\tau_{c}$
- Utility function:  $U(C) - V(H)$
- Budget constraint:  $(1 + \tau_{c})C = (1 - \tau_{l})wH + T$
- Labor supply:
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w \frac{1 - \tau_{l}}{1 + \tau_{c}}
$$
# Labor Supply and Taxes
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w \frac{1 - \tau_{l}}{1 + \tau_{c}}
$$
- After tax wage:  $w \frac{1 - \tau_{l}}{1 + \tau_{c}} < w$
- Why not just  $w(1 - \tau_{l})$ , i.e., take-home pay?
- Not wage in dollars that matter, but how much this can buy
- Consumption tax increases price of goods by  $(1 + \tau_{c})$
- $w \frac{1 - \tau_{l}}{1 + \tau_{c}}$  is how many coconuts you can buy per hour of work
# Tax Wedge
- Let's simplify our notation a little
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w \frac{1 - \tau_{l}}{1 + \tau_{c}}
$$
- Define the overall tax wedge as
$$
(1 - \tau) = \left(1 - \frac{\tau_{l} + \tau_{c}}{1 + \tau_{c}}\right) = \frac{1 - \tau_{l}}{1 + \tau_{c}}
$$
- Using this overall tax wedge we get
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w (1 - \tau)
$$
# Taxes and Labor Supply
$$
\frac{V^{\prime} (H)}{U^{\prime} (C)} = w (1 - \tau)
$$
- After tax wage:  $w(1 - \tau)$
- How does this affect labor supply?
- Substitution effect leads to lower labor supply
- Income effect goes in other direction
- However, strength of income effect depends on what the government does with tax revenue (How so?)
# Income Effect and Use of Tax Revenue
- Suppose the government threw the tax revenue in the ocean (wasted it, bridges to nowhere, military spending to fight wars on foreign soil)
- Would people feel poorer due to taxes?
- Yes they would
- Taxes would have income effect
- Income effect might be as large or larger than substitution effect
# Income Effect and Use of Tax Revenue
- Suppose the government transferred money back to people though “lump-sum” transfers
- Would people feel poorer due to taxes?
- No. (They pay taxes but get same amount back in transfer)
- Suppose the government used tax revenue to buy goods people would have bought anyway (childcare, healthcare, etc.)
- Income effect depends on quality of the stuff the government buys
- Taxes would have smaller (possibly no) income effect
# Income Effect and Use of Tax Revenue
- Income effect from taxes is large if government wastes money (or spends on things people would not buy, such as military)
- Income effect from taxes is small if government uses revenue for transfers or to provide goods and services people would have bought anyway.
# Income Effect and Use of Tax Revenue
Real world probably somewhere between two polar cases discussed above
- For simplicity, however, we follow Prescott (2002) and assume all tax revenue is transferred back to household lump-sum
- This implies there is no income effect of taxes
- This therefore maximizes the effect of taxes on hours
# How Much Do Taxes Depress Labor Supply?
- To make quantitative predictions, we need to be more precise about utility function of households
- We assume:
$$
U (C) - V (H) = \ln C - \psi \frac{H^{1 - \eta^{- 1}}}{1 - \eta^{- 1}}
$$
This implies
$$
U^{\prime} (C) = \frac{1}{C} \quad \text{an d} V^{\prime} (H) = \psi H^{\eta^{- 1}}
$$
# How Much Do Taxes Depress Labor Supply?
- Labor supply is then:
$$
\psi C H^{\eta^{- 1}} = w (1 - \tau)
$$
- In the production chapter we derived labor demand:
$$ w = (1 - a) \frac{Y}{L}
$$
Combining these we have
$$
\psi C H^{\eta - 1} = (1 - a) \frac{Y}{L} (1 - \tau)
$$
# How Much Do Taxes Depress Labor Supply?
$$
\psi C H^{\eta^{- 1}} = (1 - a) \frac{Y}{L} (1 - \tau)
$$
- Recall that  $L = N H$  and we normalize  $N$  to 1
- Since all tax revenue is transferred back lump sum, the household budget constraint becomes  $C = wH$
- This and  $w = (1 - a)\frac{Y}{L}$  implies  $C = (1 - a)Y$
Using these expressions we get:
$$
\psi C H^{\eta - 1} = \frac{C}{H} (1 - \tau)
$$
# How Much Do Taxes Depress Labor Supply?
- Rearranging yields:
$$
H^{1 + \eta^{- 1}} = (1 - \tau) \psi^{- 1}
$$
- Taking logs yields:
$$
\ln H = \frac{\eta}{\eta + 1} \ln (1 - \tau) - \frac{\eta}{\eta + 1} \ln \psi
$$
- Taking a difference between US and France:
$$
\ln H_{F r} - \ln H_{U S} = \frac{\eta}{\eta + 1} (\ln (1 - \tau_{F r}) - \ln (1 - \tau_{U S}))
$$
(note that  $(\eta^{-1} + 1)^{-1} = \frac{\eta}{\eta + 1}$ )
# Key Determinant
$$
\ln H_{F r} - \ln H_{U S} = \frac{\eta}{\eta + 1} \left(\ln (1 - \tau_{F r}) - \ln (1 - \tau_{U S})\right)
$$
- Clearly  $\eta$  is a key parameter
- $\eta$  is called the Frisch elasticity of labor supply
- $\eta$  is the \% change in hours that result from a  $1\%$  change in wages holding consumption fixed. (i.e., the strength of the substitution effect)
- If  $\eta$  is small (i.e., labor is inelastic), taxes have a small effect on labor supply.
- If,  $\eta$  is large (i.e., labor is elastic), taxes have a big effect on labor supply (assuming no income effects)
# Value of Theory
- Student A and B should argue about two things:
- Value of  $\eta$  (i.e., strength of substitution effect)
- Whether tax revenue is well spent
(i.e., do more taxes/spending entail an income effect)
This is how theory can be useful
# Taxes in France and U.S.
Prescott (2002) reported taxes in U.S. and France in late 1990s
- Reproduced in Table 4
- Taxes much higher in France
- Difference in hours in 2000 was 31 log points
- Can taxes explain this difference?
Table 4: Tax Rates in France and the United States
<table><tr><td></td><td>France</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>τc</td><td>0.33</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>πl</td><td>0.49</td><td>0.32</td></tr><tr><td>Social-security tax</td><td>0.33</td><td>0.12</td></tr><tr><td>Marginal income tax</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.20</td></tr><tr><td>τ</td><td>0.62</td><td>0.40</td></tr></table>
# How Much Can Taxes Explain?
- If Frisch elasticity is small (0.1-0.5), taxes can explain modest amount
- If Frisch elasticity is large (say 3), taxes can explain entire amount
Prescott argued for  $\eta = 3$
This is all assuming no income effect
Table 5: How Much Can Taxes Explain?
<table><tr><td>Frisch Elasticity (η)</td><td>Hours Difference</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>0.1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Actual Difference in 2000</td><td>31</td></tr></table>
# Estimating the Frisch Elasticity is Hard
- Need temporary tax change
- Frisch elasticity holds consumption fixed
- Permanent tax changes have potentially large effects on consumption which adds a negative income effect (downward bias)
- Hard to extrapolate from small changes due to frictions
- Costly adjustment and inattention may prevent response to small tax changes
- Results in downward biased estimates
- Also, some adjustment may occur gradually (new jobs / retirement)
# Tax Holidays
- Tax holidays provide very appealing “treatments” to estimate Frisch elasticity
- Temporary / Large
- Possible to estimate both intensive and extensive margin effects
- Two recent papers on tax holidays:
- Sigurdsson (2025) -- Iceland
- Martinez, Saez, and Siegenthaler (2021) - Switzerland
# Tax Free Year in Iceland
- In 1988, Iceland moved to pay-as-you-earn tax system (from a system where people paid taxes based on last year's income)
- Income in 1987 never taxed!!

# How to Use Tax Free Year
We can compare 1987 with surrounding years
- But perhaps there are other things that are different in 1987 from other years
What is the counterfactual?
Trend up before, down after
- Hard to know
- Icelandic economy volatile due to varying fish stocks and volatile policy

# Tax Free Year in Iceland
- Workers in high tax bracket increased earning by  $7 \%$ more than workers in low tax bracket
- Sigurdsson converts this into estimate of Frisch elasticity
- His conclusion:
- Intensive margin: 0.4
- Extensive margin: 0.1
- Overall Frisch elasticity of 0.5

# Tax Free Year in Switzerland
- Martinez, Saez, and Siegenthaler estimate Frisch elasticity close to zero – less than 0.05
- Also Diff-in-Diff, but not across tax brackets, rather across Swiss cantons
- Cantons transitioned to new tax system in different years. So, different tax-free year in different cantons
- Effect on earning very small

# Tax Holiday Estimates
- Frisch elasticity estimates:
- Sigurdsson for Iceland: 0.50
Martinez, Saez, Siegenthaler for Switzerland: <0.05
- Both much lower than number Prescott used
- Why is Iceland different from Switzerland?
- Perhaps because labor market is more flexible in Iceland than in Switzerland
- US labor market arguably even more flexible
# The Economics of Marx
- Karl Marx is arguably the most influential labor economist of all time
- Ideas resonate strongly with students today
- Contrast strongly with ideas we have presented
- Worth exploring the difference
We consider essay Wage-Labor, and Capital published in 1849
- Marx and Engels (1848): Communist Manifesto
# The Economics of Marx
- Marx writes:
“the productive power of labor is raised, above all, by the greater division of labor
- “division of labor” is Marx' preferred term for labor productivity
# The Economics of Marx
"The greater division of labor enables one worker to do the work of five, ten or twenty"
"It therefore multiplies competition among workers fivefold, tenfold and twentyfold."
"As the division of labor increases, labor is simplified. The special skill of the worker becomes worthless."
Marx (1849): Wage-Labor and Capital
# The Economics of Marx
Let us sum up: The more productive capital grows, the more the division of labour and the application of machinery expands. The more the division of labour and the application of machinery expands, the more competition among the workers expands and the more their wages contract.
- Productivity growth (division of labor) leads wages to fall
What did our model imply about this?
# Increase in Productivity
- Increase in productivity shifts labor demand out
$$
(1 - a) A K^{a} L^{- a} = w
$$
- Increases wage
- Permanent increase in productivity shifts labor supply back (income effect)
$$ w U^{\prime} (C) = V^{\prime} (H)
$$
- Increases wage even more

Figure 18: The Effect of an Increase in Productivity on the Labor Market
# Empirically Marx Was Dead Wrong
- Labor productivity has increased at a sustained rate for over 200 years
Real wages of workers have grown at approximately the same rate over this period

# Was Marx Simply Confused?
- Marx is clear that higher productivity lowers prices of goods
- But doesn't this make workers better off
- Neither nominal wage  $W$  nor nominal price  $P$  determine worker welfare. Rather it is real wage  $W / P$
- If  $P$  goes down more than  $W$ ,  $W / P$  will rise and workers are better off
- Not clear Marx understood this point when reading his essay
# Can We Make Sense of Marx?
1. Does labor demand shifts out?
Our model: People get more productive  $\Rightarrow$  production increases
- Marx: Higher productivity  $=>$  less work
"It therefore multiplies competition among workers fivefold, tenfold and twentyfold."
- This idea resonates strongly with people
- Technological change destroys jobs and makes workers worse off
# Does Labor Demand Shift Out?
- Which view – more output or less works – is correct?
Depends on demand in the product market. I.e., can the firm sell extra output?
- Suppose firm productivity double. Should it:
- Produce twice as much with same number of workers
- Fire half of workers
- Suppose firm decides to produce more
- Who is going to buy the extra goods?
- Do people have enough income to buy the extra goods?
# Circular Flow of Payments
- If someone buys the extra goods, this provides extra income to seller and employees of seller
- Income goes up in tandem with expenditures:
- One person’s expenditure is another person’s income
- Circular flow of payments in a market economy
- But there seems to be a chicken and egg problem:
- If the goods sell, people will have income to buy them
- But what comes first, the income or the expenditures
# Market Clearing
- Basic assumption in neoclassical economics: Markets clear
- This means everything that is produced will sell
- And this implies that someone will have enough income to buy it
- Timing issues about who gets paid first assumed away (everything assumed to happen simultaneously)
- The real question is at what price it will sell
- This perspective effectively assumes away the Marxist/Keynesian worry of insufficient demand
# Do Markets Clear?
- Changes in prices and wages are what clear markets
- Price of goods goes down, wage goes up, workers have more purchasing power
- But what if prices are sticky?
- Can’t expand production. Don’t need as many workers.
- Sticky prices yield insufficient demand (after increase in productivity)
- Such models are called Keynesian (Keynes, 1936)
- Perhaps Marx was a Keynesian long before Keynes
- Sticky prices more plausible in the short run than long run
# Can We Make Sense of Marx?
2. Marx makes a “Malthusian” argument:
- Wages will be determined by:
“the cost of production of labor power” …
“the cost required for maintaining the worker as a worker” …
“the cost of existence and reproduction”
- Wages of unskilled labor driven down to subsistence
- Wages fall due to “division of labor” because work requires less skill and so cost of “developing him into a worker” falls
# Can We Make Sense of Marx?
In our model labor supply shifts back
- In Marx’ view, labor supply shifts out due to increased population (Malthusian effect)
Economy moves from A to C rather than A to B
Wages stuck at subsistence
- Had been true until shortly before Marx’ time

# Can We Make Sense of Marx?
# 3. Immiserizing growth
- Can productivity growth make wages go down?
In one-good economy: No!
- Worker can always keep using old technology
In multi-good economy: Yes!
- Price of good that workers produces may fall relative to price of other goods. This can reduce real wage of workers using old tech
- Think of hand-loom weavers when mechanized weaving came in
# Was Marx Right After All?
Real wages and productivity move in lock-step 1948-80
Divergence after this
Real wages stagnant 1980-96
Real wages grow after 1996, but not as fast as productivity
- Our labor market model needs modification to explain this
Active area of research

Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Age of Capitalism

What is the appropriate role of markets in society?

- Question central to economics
- Highly charged and frequently debated
What are the intellectual justifications for free market capitalism?
- Freedom: Free market capitalism is a system based on a great deal of individual freedom. Freedom is good in and of itself.
- Material well-being: Free market capitalism generates more material well-being than other systems of organizing the economy
# Designing Utopia
- Our goal: Design a government – laws, regulation and institutions – that is as good as possible in terms of generating material well-being
- Two challenges:
- Information challenge: How do we figure out what to produce, who should produce it, and who should consume it?
- Incentive challenge: Even if we know what needs to be done, how do we get people to do these things?
# Different Ways to Organize Societies
- Families / Villages / Tribes
- Kin-based altruism, tit-for-tat, loyalty to group
- Respect for authority and existing hierarchies
- Larger societies:
- Raw coercion, respect for authority and existing hierarchies
- Society very rigid / No solution to information challenge
- Is there another way?
- Central planning? Something else?
# Adam Smith's Radical Idea
- How about if we simply:
- Grant the individuals of society freedom to choose themselves what they produce and consume
- Allow then to engage in free exchange of goods and labor to realize these choices
- Smith argued:
- Such freedom might in many circumstances lead to better social outcomes than more directed, coercive, and centrally controlled economic management
# Surprising Result
- Free-market capitalism can attain high level of material well-being without relying at all on:
- Altruism, group loyalty, respect for existing hierarchies
- Planning and centralized control
- Perhaps the most surprising and interesting idea in all of economics
Economics is mostly "organized common sense".
- But the idea of the laissez faire policy can do as well as an ominous/omnipotent/benevolent central planner is for from obvious
# A Formal Model
- To grasp these ideas better, it is useful to write down a formal model
- We begin by describing only the physical environment
  - No assumptions about institutions such as markets, laws, property rights, etc.
- Derive what is efficient
- Then show that competitive markets deliver this outcome
# Simplest Possible Setting
- Two consumers:
— Robinson Crusoe (R) and Friday (F)
- Two inputs to production:
- Labor (L) and land (N)
- Two outputs:
- Coconuts (C) and shelter (S)
- Two technologies:
- One produces coconuts, the other shelter
# Endowments and Technology
- Robinson Crusoe and Friday start off with endowments of time  $(\omega_{T})$  and land  $(\omega_{N})$
- Time can be used either for labor or leisure
- They also have access to knowledge of the two technologies:
- Production function for coconuts:
$$
Y_{C} = F_{C} (L_{C}, N_{C})
$$
- Production function for shelter:
$$
Y_{S} = F_{S} (L_{S}, N_{S})
$$
# Preferences
- We represent the preferences of Robinson Crusoe and Friday by utility functions
- Robinson Crusoe's utility function:
$$
U_{R} \big (X_{C, R}, X_{S, R}, X_{Z, R} \big)
$$
- $X_{C,R}$  denotes the consumption of coconuts by R
- $X_{S,R}$  denotes the consumption of shelter by R
- $X_{Z,R}$  denotes the "consumption" of leisure by  $R$
- Friday's utility function:
$$
U_{F} \left(X_{C, F}, X_{S, F}, X_{Z, F}\right)
$$
# An Allocation

We define an allocation as some particular outcome for all endogenous quantities:

- Inputs used:  $L_{C}, L_{S}, N_{C}, N_{S}$
- Output produced:  $Y_{C}, Y_{S}$
- Consumption:  $X_{C,R}, X_{C,F}, X_{S,R}, X_{S,F}, X_{Z,R}, X_{Z,F}$
- Notices that there are no prices yet since we have not introduced any markets
- Also, no-one owns anything at the moment.
# A Feasible Allocation
- We define a feasible allocation as an allocation that satisfies all constraints imposed by the physical environment
- Land use:  $N_{C} + N_{S} = \omega_{N}$
- Time use:  $L_{C} + L_{S} + X_{Z, R} + X_{Z, F} = \omega_{T}$
- Consumption of coconuts:  $X_{C,R} + X_{C,F} = Y_{C}$
- Consumption of shelter:  $X_{S,R} + X_{S,F} = Y_S$
- Production functions:  $Y_{C} = F_{C}(L_{C},N_{C})$  and  $Y_{S} = F_{S}(L_{S},N_{S})$
# Efficient Allocation
- Our goal is to describe the efficient feasible allocation (efficient allocation for short)
- How do we define what is efficient?
- Efficiency refers to lack of waste
- Since our ultimate aim is utility of people, we define efficiency in terms of whether we are squandering opportunities to make someone better off without making anyone else worse off
# Pareto Efficiency
- Informally: An allocation is Pareto Efficient (or Pareto Optimal) if no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
- Formally: Allocation A is Pareto Efficient (or Pareto Optimal) if no other feasible allocation B exists such that  $U_{i,B} \geq U_{i,A}$  for all  $i$  and  $U_{i,B} > U_{i,A}$  for at least one  $i$ .
# Pareto Improvement
- An allocation A is said to be a Pareto improvement over allocation B if someone is better of under allocation A but no one is worse off
- In this case, allocation B is said to be Pareto inefficient.
# Pareto Efficiency: Example
# - Government builds a bridge
- People pay tolls. Tolls pay for bridge
- Potential Pareto improvement
- Why only potential?
- Perhaps bridge diverts traffic and business away from some stores. Owners worse off.
- Perhaps noise or shadow from bridge adversely affects neighbors of bridge
- How can this be fixed? (in principle)
# The "Weakness" of Pareto Efficiency
- Pareto efficiency is a rather "weak" concept
- Many Pareto efficient allocations:
- Consider an allocation where one agent gets all the resources.
- This is Pareto efficient since all other allocations make them worse off
- Many allocations that cannot be Pareto ranked
- Pareto efficiency does not concern itself at all with distributional issues
# Utilitarian Optimal Outcome
- Add up everyone's utility (weighted sum):
$$
\theta_{R} U_{R} \big (X_{C, R}, X_{S, R}, X_{Z, R} \big) + \theta_{F} U_{F} \big (X_{C, F}, X_{S, F}, X_{Z, F} \big)
$$
- Rank allocations by this weighted sum
- Allocation that maximizes this weighted sum is utilitarian optimal outcome
- Can taking from the rich and giving to the poor improve welfare from this perspective?
- Yes. Since poor have higher marginal utility
- But if you start systematically doing this, you may weaken incentives to work ("reduce the size of the pie")
- This is NOT our definition of efficiency
# Conditions for Pareto Efficiency
1. Exchange Efficiency
- There cannot be any scope for mutually advantageous trade in final goods
2. Production Efficiency
- There cannot be any scope for Pareto improving reallocation of factors of production between their different uses.
# Exchange Efficiency
- Say we start with a candidate efficient allocation, which we denote by  ${}^{*}$  (e.g.,  $X_{C,R}^{*}$ )
- Let's consider variations on this allocation to test whether we can find another allocation that does better
- How about taking some shelter from Friday and giving it to Robinson Crusoe?
- Could this be a Pareto improvement?
- No!! (Friday would never agree to this)
# Exchange Efficiency
- Suppose, instead, that we:
- Take  $\varepsilon$  units of shelter from F and give to R and in exchange take  $\eta \varepsilon$  coconuts from R and give to F
- Here  $\eta$  is the number of coconuts per unit of shelter in this "exchange"
- If the initial allocation is Pareto efficient, this variation cannot make one of them better off without making the other worse off
# Exchange Efficiency
- Useful notation:
$$
U_{R, C}^{*} = \frac{\partial}{\partial X_{R , C}} U_{R} \big (X_{C, R}^{*}, X_{S, R}^{*}, X_{Z, R}^{*} \big)
$$
- i.e.  $U_{R,C}^{*}$  denotes the partial derivative of  $U_{R}$  with respect to  $X_{C,R}$  at the point  $\left(X_{C,R}^{*}, X_{S,R}^{*}, X_{Z,R}^{*}\right)$
- We will use the same type of notation for other partial derivatives of both the utility functions and the production functions
# Exchange Efficiency

Robinson Crusoe's utility:

$$
U_{R} \big (X_{C, R}^{*} - \eta \varepsilon , X_{S, R}^{*} + \varepsilon , X_{Z, R}^{*} \big)
$$
- Let's differentiate Robinson Crusoe's utility with respect to  $\varepsilon$  and evaluate at  $\varepsilon = 0$ :
$$
\frac{d U_{R}}{d \varepsilon} = - U_{R, C}^{*} \eta + U_{R, S}^{*}
$$
- Friday's utility:
$$
U_{F} \left(X_{C, F}^{*} + \eta \varepsilon , X_{S, F}^{*} - \varepsilon , X_{Z, F}^{*}\right)
$$
- Let's differentiate Friday's utility with respect to  $\varepsilon$  and evaluate at  $\varepsilon = 0$ :
$$
\frac{d U_{F}}{d \varepsilon} = U_{F, C}^{*} \eta - U_{F, S}^{*}
$$
# Exchange Efficiency
- How should be choose  $\eta$ ?
- Very big or very small won't work
- One of them worse off
- Let's choose it so as to make Robinson Crusoe indifferent to the change
- Why is this a good choice?
– In that case, the change is a Pareto improvement if (and only if) it makes Friday better off!
$$
\frac{d U_{R}}{d \varepsilon} = - U_{R, C}^{*} \eta + U_{R, S}^{*} = 0
$$
$$
\eta = \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}}
$$
# Exchange Efficiency
- Let's now plug this value for  $\eta$  into the marginal change in Friday's utility
$$
\frac{d U_{F}}{d \varepsilon} = U_{F, C}^{*} \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}} - U_{F, S}^{*}
$$
- What must be true about this expression if the initial allocation is Pareto efficient?
- It must be equal to zero (i.e. the derivative of Friday's utility with respect to  $\varepsilon$  must be zero at the optimum)
- Otherwise beneficial to do either a positive or negative amount of the proposed "exchange"
# Exchange Efficiency
- Exchange efficiency therefore implies:
$$
\frac{d U_{F}}{d \varepsilon} = U_{F, C}^{*} \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}} - U_{F, S}^{*} = 0
$$
$$
\frac{U_{F , S}^{*}}{U_{F , C}^{*}} = \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}}
$$
# Exchange Efficiency
$$
\frac{U_{F , S}^{*}}{U_{F , C}^{*}} = \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}}
$$
- $U_{F, C}^{*}$  is utility  $F$  gets from one extra coconut
- $U_{F,S}^{*}$  is utility  $F$  gets from one extra unit of shelter
- $1 / U_{F, C}^{*}$  coconuts give F one "util"
- $U_{F, S}^{*} / U_{F, C}^{*}$  coconuts give F  $U_{F, S}^{*}$  "utils"
- $U_{F,S}^{*} / U_{F,C}^{*}$  is  $\#$  of coconuts that  $F$  is willing to give up to get 1 extra unit of shelter (marginal rate of substitution)
# Exchange Efficiency
$$
\frac{U_{F , S}^{*}}{U_{F , C}^{*}} = \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}}
$$
- Intuition: # of coconuts R would be willing to give up for an extra unit of shelter must be same as for F. Why?
- Otherwise there is scope for mutually advantageous trade
- Suppose  $U_{F,S}^{*} / U_{F,C}^{*} = 4$ , while  $U_{R,S}^{*} / U_{R,C}^{*} = 2$ . Why is this not an efficient outcome?
- If F offers R 3 coconuts in exchange for 1 unit of shelter, both are made better off.
# Production Efficiency
- Variation: Robinson Crusoe works  $\varepsilon$  more hours on gathering coconuts and gets to keep the proceeds
- Marginal Benefit?  $U_{R, C}^{*} F_{C, L}^{*}$
- Here  $F_{C,L}^{*}$  denotes the partial derivative of  $F_{C}$  with respect to  $L$  at the allocation *
- Marginal Cost?  $U_{R, Z}^{*}$
- Optimality necessitates?
$$
U_{R, C}^{*} F_{C, L}^{*} = U_{R, Z}^{*} \qquad \mathrm{or} \qquad \frac{U_{R , Z}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}} = F_{C, L}^{*}
$$
# Production Efficiency Intuition
$$
\frac{U_{R , Z}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}} = F_{C, L}^{*}
$$
- Intuition: # of coconuts R is willing to give up for an extra hour of leisure must equal # of coconuts one can produce using an extra hour of labor
- Otherwise R can be made better off by working either more or less
- Suppose  $\frac{U_{R, Z}^{*}}{U_{R, C}^{*}} > F_{C, L}^{*}$ . Why is this not efficient?
- This means that R is working too much since the last hour he worked only yields  $F_{C, L}^{*}$  coconuts but costs him as much utility as giving up  $U_{R, Z}^{*} / U_{R, C}^{*}$  coconuts
# Production Efficiency
- Similar arguments yield similar conditions for
— Robinson Crusoe working more/less on shelter
- Friday working more/less on coconuts
- Friday working more/less on shelter
These conditions are listed in draft chapter
# Efficient Use of Land
- What about land use? How much land is it efficient to use?
- We assumed (for simplicity) that land has no alternative use. So, they might as well use all the land for coconut and shelter production.
- Only question is how to divide up the land between coconut and shelter production
- What condition must hold for the division of land between coconut and shelter production to be efficient?
# Efficient Use of Land
- Variation: Suppose R transfer  $\varepsilon$  acres of land away from coconut production towards shelter production
- Marginal benefit:  $U_{R, S}^{*} F_{S, N}^{*}$
- Marginal cost:  $U_{R, C}^{*} F_{C, N}^{*}$
- Efficiency necessitates?
$$
U_{R, S}^{*} F_{S, N}^{*} = U_{R, C}^{*} F_{C, N}^{*} \mathrm{or} \frac{U_{R , C}^{*}}{U_{R , S}^{*}} = \frac{F_{S , N}^{*}}{F_{C , N}^{*}}
$$
# Pareto Efficiency

Exchange efficiency

- Production efficiency
- Efficient land use (part of production efficiency)
- These are all the conditions that need to hold for an allocation to be Pareto efficient
# Conditions for Efficiency

Exchange Efficiency:

$$
\frac{U_{F , S}^{*}}{U_{F , C}^{*}} = \frac{U_{R , S}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}}
$$

Efficient use of land:

$$
\frac{U_{R , C}^{*}}{U_{R , S}^{*}} = \frac{F_{S , N}^{*}}{F_{C , N}^{*}}
$$
- Production efficiency:
$$
\frac{U_{R , Z}^{*}}{U_{R , C}^{*}} = F_{C, L}^{*}
$$

(and analogous conditions for  $F$  and  $S$ )

# Pareto Efficient Allocation
- How can we bring about this outcome?
1. Central Planning
A benevolent, omniscient, omnipotent central authority could achieve this allocation by directive
- i.e, they would calculate what the optimum was and tell everyone they have to do that or else they will be shot (less extreme measures might work)
Is there an alternative?
# Markets
- Suppose there is a competitive market where R and F can exchange coconuts for shelter
- Competitive means that all agents in the economy take prices as given (and markets clear at those prices)
- Let's denote the price in this market as  $p$  coconuts per unit shelter (so coconuts are the numeraire)
# Product Market
- What will Robinson Crusoe do in this market?
- $U_{R,S} / U_{R,C}$  is marginal benefit of buying shelter (in units of coconuts)
- $p$  is marginal cost of buying shelter (in units of coconuts)
- Robinson Crusoe will set these equal to each other. I.e., trade shelter for coconuts until:
$$
\frac{U_{R , S}}{U_{R , C}} = p
$$
# Product Market

What will Friday do in this market?

- Also trade shelter for coconuts until:
$$
\frac{U_{F , S}}{U_{F , C}} = p
$$

What does this imply about exchange efficiency?

$$
\frac{U_{F , S}}{U_{F , C}} = p = \frac{U_{R , S}}{U_{R , C}}
$$
- A competitive market for trading shelter for coconuts, thus, yields exchange efficiency in shelter versus coconuts!
# Labor Market
- Suppose there is a competitive labor market with a wage denoted by  $w$  (coconuts per hour worked)
What will Robinson Crusoe do?
- Marginal benefit of work:  $w$  (in units of coconuts)
- Margin cost of work:  $\frac{U_{R, Z}}{U_{R, C}}$  (in units of coconuts)
- Robinson Crusoe will:
- Supply labor until  $\frac{U_{R, Z}}{U_{R, C}} = w$
- Friday will do the same
What will owner of coconut technology do?
- Marginal benefit:  $F_{C,L}$
- Marginal cost:  $w$
- Owner will demand labor until  $w = {F}_{C,L}$
# Labor Market
- A competitive labor market will therefore yield production efficiency
$$
\frac{U_{R , Z}}{U_{R , C}} = w = F_{C, L}
$$
- Same logic for other production efficiency conditions
# Land Market
- Suppose there is a competitive rental market for land with a rental rate  $r$  (in terms of coconuts per acre of land)
What will coconut producers do?
- Demand land until  $F_{C, N} = r$
What will shelter producers do?
- Demand land until  $pF_{S,N} = r$
$$
\begin{array}{l} p F_{S, N} = F_{C, N} \\ \Rightarrow \frac{U_{R , S}}{U_{R , C}} F_{S, N} = F_{C, N} \\ \Rightarrow \frac{U_{R , S}}{U_{R , C}} = \frac{F_{C , N}}{F_{S , N}} \\ \end{array}
$$
- A competitive land market will therefore yield efficient allocation of land
# Competitive Markets Can Achieve Efficiency
- Goods market yields exchange efficiency:
$$
\frac{U_{F , S}}{U_{F , C}} = p = \frac{U_{R , S}}{U_{R , C}}
$$
- Labor market yields production efficiency:
$$
\frac{U_{R , Z}}{U_{R , C}} = w = F_{C, L}
$$
- Land market yields efficient use of land:
$$ p F_{S, N} = r = F_{C, N} \Rightarrow \frac{U_{R , S}}{U_{R , C}} = \frac{F_{C , N}}{F_{S , N}}
$$
# First Welfare Theorem

If:

- Everyone is able to choose what is best for themselves among the set of options they have
- Competitive markets for all goods and services (both inputs and output) exist
- Property rights over all goods and services are well defined and costlessly enforceable
- Equilibrium will be Pareto efficient
This result is called the First Welfare Theorem
# First Welfare Theorem

We have derived FWT for a simple example

- Can be generalize to economies with:
- Any number of goods
- Multiple periods (if all people exist at all times)
— Uncertainty (as long as information is "symmetric")
# Remarkable Results
- Milton and Rose Friedman:
"Adam Smith's flash of genius was his recognition that the prices that emerged from voluntary transactions between buyers and sellers … could coordinate the activity of millions of people, each seeking his [or her] own interest, in such a way as to make everyone better off. It was a startling idea then, and it remains one today."
# Ideal Free Market Capitalism
- With competitive markets and well defined property rights: No one can rip off anyone else!!
- Competition keeps everyone in check
- Everyone is paid their marginal product
- All goods are priced at marginal cost
E.g., labor market:
- Competition between firms bids wage up to marginal product
- Competition between workers bids wage down to marginal product
# Implications for Role of Government?
- If markets are "complete" and "perfect", and property rights are well defined and costlessly enforceable, laissez faire government policy yields a Pareto efficient outcome
- Even if we are concerned with redistribution, the only necessary government policy is an initial redistribution of wealth. (Second Welfare Theorem discussed in chapter)
# "Only"
- Low cost enforcement of property rights and contracts and maintenance of institutions needed for competitive markets NOT easy
- "Let the market take care of things" is an illusion.
- Need to work hard to create maintain competitive markets
# Conditions for Efficiency
1. "Complete" and "perfect" markets for all goods (First Welfare Theorem)
- In our simple setting, market for labor, land, coconuts and shelter
In real world, markets for every conceivable thing
Huge "institutional" requirement
# Or:
2. No impediments to private contracts (Coase theorem)
Even with no "markets" if Crusoe and Friday could costlessly negotiate and enforce private contracts they should arrive at an efficient outcome
- Also large institutional requirement (enforcement of contracts)
- In both cases: Government must exist to enforce property rights and contracts. "Perfect courts" needed.
# Flip Side of the Coin
- If conditions of "First Welfare Theorem" or "Coase Theorem" are not satisfied, markets / voluntary exchange will not yield an efficient outcome
- We will refer to deviations from the conditions needed for the First Welfare Theorem as market failures
- Main sources of market failures:
- Monopoly, public goods, transactions costs, asymmetric information, imperfect rationality, commitment problems, price and wage rigidity, missing market
# Typical Argument about Economic Policy
- Issue: Should government do X?
- Free market advocate:
- Markets can take care of X
- Voluntary exchange can take care of X
- Very powerful argument rhetorically
One way a skeptic of laissez faire can potentially win argument is by pointing out a market failure and explaining how government can resolve the market failure
# Lecture 5 Consumption and Saving

Macroeconomics (Quantitative) Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Where Do We Stand?

We have studied:

- Production (labor demand and capital demand)
- Household Labor-Leisure (labor supply)
- Efficiency of private property/free market setting
- Next topic:
— Household Consumption-Savings decision
# The Consumption-Savings Model
- Suppose Robinson Crusoe lives for two periods
- Let's simplify: Ignore both production and labor-leisure decision
- Instead: Robinson Crusoe gets a set endowment of coconuts in each of the two periods:  $Y_{1}$  and  $Y_{2}$
- For simplicity, we assume that Robinson Crusoe knows values of both  $Y_{1}$  and  $Y_{2}$  in period 1
# A Savings Technology
- Robinson Crusoe has access to a "savings technology" (safe investment opportunity)
- He can choose to save some of  $Y_{1}$
- If he saves  $B$  coconuts at time 1, the savings technology yields  $(1 + R)B$  coconuts at time 2
- We say that the savings technology has a gross return of  $(1 + R)$  and a net return of  $R$
- $R$  is the "interest rate" in the economy
# Saving and Borrowing
- The "savings technology" is symmetric: Robinson Crusoe can either "save" coconuts or "borrow" coconuts
- We can think of the savings technology as borrowing and lending with a neighboring islander (i.e., Friday)
- If Robinson Crusoe borrows,  $B < 0$
- In both cases, the return is  $R$  (for simplicity)
# The Consumption-Savings Model
- Robinson Crusoe's budget constraints are:
In period 1?
$$
C_{1} + B = Y_{1}
$$

In period 2?

$$
C_{2} = Y_{2} + (1 + R) B
$$
# Limits on Saving and Borrowing
- What is the most Robinson Crusoe can save?
$$
B \leq Y_{1}
$$
- What is the most Robinson Crusoe can borrow?
- As much as he can pay off in period 2:
$$
(1 + R) B \geq - Y_{2} \mathrm{wh ic hi mp li es} B \geq - \frac{Y_{2}}{(1 + R)}
$$
# Utility Function
- In general, Robinson Crusoe's utility function can be written
$$
U (C_{1}, C_{2})
$$
- We will, however, specialize and consider the utility function
$$
U \left(C_{1}\right) + \beta U \left(C_{2}\right)
$$
- Here,  $\beta$  is called Robinson Crusoe's subjective discount factor
# Interpretation of  $\beta$
$$
U (C_{1}) + \beta U (C_{2})
$$

What is the interpretation of  $\beta$ ?

- $\beta$  is the weight Robinson puts on future consumption relative to current consumption
- $\beta$  governs Robinson Crusoe's degree of patience
- If  $\beta < 1$ , Robinson Crusoe down-weights (discounts) future consumption
- If period length is one year, a typical value used is something like  $\beta = 0.98$  (but lower numbers may be reasonable)
# Consumption-Savings Model
- Robinson Crusoe maximizes
$$
U (C_{1}) + \beta U (C_{2})
$$
- Subject to:
$$
C_{1} + B = Y_{1}
$$
$$
C_{2} = Y_{2} + (1 + R) B
$$

(and limits on borrowing and saving)

- What are the endogenous variables?  $C_{1}, C_{2}, B$
- Exogenous variables:  $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, R$
- Parameters:  $\beta$
# Solving Model: Plug and Chug
1. Combine budget constraints into one "intertemporal" budget constraint:
$$
C_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + R} C_{2} = Y_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + R} Y_{2}
$$

This eliminates  $B$  from the household's problem

- Intertemporal budget constraint says:
- "Present value" of consumption must equal "present value" of income
What does "present value" mean?
# Present Value
- How much does it cost at time 1 to purchase the right to one coconut in period 2?
- Price must be equal to the number of coconuts you need to store in period 1 to get one coconut in period 2. Which is?
$$
\frac{1}{1 + R}
$$
- We therefore say that the present value in period 1 of the right to one coconut in period 2 is  $1 / (1 + R)$  coconuts
# Solving Model
2. Plug intertemporal budget constraint into objective function:
$$
U (C_{1}) + \beta U (C_{2})
$$
$$
U \left(C_{1}\right) + \beta U \left((1 + R) Y_{1} + Y_{2} - (1 + R) C_{1}\right)
$$
- This eliminates  $C_2$  from the household's problem
Now we have a simple optimization problem with one choice variable
- How is this solved?
# Solving Model
$$
U (C_{1}) + \beta U \big ((1 + R) Y_{1} + Y_{2} - (1 + R) C_{1} \big)
$$
- Differentiate and set to zero:
$$
U^{\prime} (C_{1}) - \beta (1 + R) U^{\prime} (C_{2}) = 0
$$
- Rearrange:
$$
U^{\prime} (C_{1}) = \beta (1 + R) U^{\prime} (C_{2})
$$
- This equation is called the "consumption Euler equation"
# Euler Equation by Variational Argument
- We can alternatively derive the consumption Euler equation using a "variational argument"(as usual this yields more insight)
- Starting from some candidate optimal choice  $(C_{1}, C_{2})$  suppose Robinson Crusoe contemplates saving a little bit more
- Marginal cost:  $U^{\prime}\left(C_{1}\right)$
- Marginal benefit:  $\beta U^{\prime}\left(C_{2}\right)(1 + R)$
- Robinson Crusoe must set these equal to each other:
$$
U^{\prime} \left(C_{1}\right) = \beta (1 + R) U^{\prime} \left(C_{2}\right)
$$
# Log Utility
- To gain further insight, we assume
$$
U (C) = \log C
$$

This implies

$$
U^{\prime} (C) = \frac{1}{C}
$$
- Consumption Euler equation becomes
$$
\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} = \beta (1 + R)
$$
# Consumption Growth
$$
\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} = \beta (1 + R)
$$
- How does growth in income  $(Y_{2} / Y_{1})$  affect Robinson Crusoe's consumption growth?
- It doesn't!!!
- Consumption growth is the same whether bulk of income is received in period 1 or period 2
# Consumption-Savings
- Suppose most of income is in period 2
- Robinson Crusoe could have consumption track income
- Why is this not the "optimal" thing to do?
- Because of diminishing marginal utility
- Marginal utility will be much lower in period 2 than in period 1
- Last coconut in period 2 yields much less utility than next coconut in period 1
- So, Robinson Crusoe should transfer consumption to period 1 and increase utility
# Consumption Smoothing
$$
\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} = \beta (1 + R)
$$
- Suppose for simplicity that  $\beta (1 + R) = 1$
This implies that:
$$
C_{1} = C_{2}
$$
- Irrespective of relative size of  $Y_{1}$  and  $Y_{2}$
- Robinson Crusoe wants to smooth his consumption over time because marginal utility is diminishing

# Consumption Growth
$$
\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} = \beta (1 + R)
$$
- Holding  $\beta$  fixed, how does consumptions growth vary with  $R$ ?
- The higher is the return on saving, the higher is the growth rate of consumption
- If return to saving is high, Robinson Crusoe decides to save a lot
- This implies that he consumes little in period 1 and a lot in period 2. So,  $C_2 / C_1$  is big.
# Solving for Level of Consumption
- With log utility we have:
$$
\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} = \beta (1 + R)
$$
$$
C_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + R} C_{2} = Y_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + R} Y_{2}
$$
- This is two equations in two unknown.
- What are the unknowns?  $C_{1}$  and  $C_{2}$
- We can therefore solve for  $C_1$  and  $C_2$
# Level of Consumption
- Solving the two equations on the previous slide yields:
$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{1 + \beta} \left(Y_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + R} Y_{2}\right)
$$
- Consumption at time 1 is a fraction of the present value of life-time income
- Consumption at time 1 only depends on current income in so far as it affects the present value of life-time income
- Current income is not special when it comes to consumption
# 45 Year Working Life
- We can extend our model to a setting in which Robinson Crusoe works for 45 years (say from age 22 to 67)
- Let's assume for simplicity that  $\beta = 1$
- Then we have:
$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{4 5} \sum_{t = 1}^{4 5} \left(\frac{1}{1 + R}\right)^{t - 1} Y_{t}
$$
- For simplicity: No initial wealth/debt and no retirement period
# Consumption and Income
$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{4 5} \sum_{t = 1}^{4 5} \left(\frac{1}{1 + R}\right)^{t - 1} Y_{t}
$$
- Again, consumption is a fraction of present value of life-time income
- Does not depend on shape of income profile
- This idea is often called the permanent income hypothesis
# Permanent Income Hypothesis

# Poll
- Suppose you receive a surprise one-time 1,000 scholarship. How much of the funds would you spend within a year?
(paying down debts is not spending) a)  $0 - 20\%$
b)  $20 - 40\%$ c)  $40 - 60\%$
d)  $60 - 80\%$ e)  $80 - 100\%$
# Consumption and Income
$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{4 5} \sum_{t = 1}^{4 5} \left(\frac{1}{1 + R}\right)^{t - 1} Y_{t}
$$
- Say you unexpectedly get a large bonus in your first year of working life (very high  $Y_{1}$ )
- Suppose this doesn't change your beliefs about income in future years
- How large a fraction should you consume of this windfall within a year and how much should you save?
# Marginal Propensity to Consume
$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{4 5} \sum_{t = 1}^{4 5} \left(\frac{1}{1 + R}\right)^{t - 1} Y_{t}
$$
- An extra dollar of income today only raises consumption today by about  $\approx 2\%$  (1/45)
- Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is said to be  $2 \%$
- MPC should be higher later in life
# Forward-Looking Behavior
- Consumption-savings model embodies forward-looking behavior on the part of Robinson Crusoe
- Nothing special about current period income
- Current consumption depends on current and future income, NOT past consumption
- Forward-looking behavior unique to economics (nothing like this in physics)
# Forward-Looking Behavior
- Suppose you are hiking down a mountain.
- You don't take the easiest first step, the easiest second step, …, and then fall off a cliff
- You look ahead and plot a route that overall is best.
- This is forward-looking behavior
- Water does not look down the hillside and decide on the "best" way down
- Water is not forward-looking
# Forward-Looking Behavior
- 60 years ago, economists modeled people as behaving much like water (today's consumption depending on yesterday's consumption and current income)
- The idea that people display forward-looking behavior is one of the most important ideas of  $20^{\text{th }}$  century macroeconomics
- Pioneered by Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas among others
# Rational Expectations
- Today, most economists model people as forming "rational expectations" about the future and acting optimally given these expectations.
Rational expectations: People should form optimal forecasts given their information
- They should not make systematic mistakes
(mistakes they should have been able to avoid given their information)
- Very strong form of forward-looking behavior
# Rational Expectations
- Do people have rational expectations?
- Think of a wide-receiver in football. Where does he run?
- In contrast, think of a squirrel (or an infant).
- Needless to say, rational expectations is very controversial
Real world is probably somewhere in between:
- People are forward-looking
- But perhaps not fully rational
- Much current research focuses on this
# Consumption-Savings: Review
- Consumption Euler Equation:
$$
U^{\prime} (C_{1}) = \beta (1 + R) U^{\prime} (C_{2})
$$
- Marginal benefit of saving an extra dollar equal to marginal cost
- With  $U(C) = \log C$ :
$$
\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}} = \beta (1 + R)
$$
- Consumption growth unrelated to income growth
- Determined by interest rate and discount factor
# Consumption-Savings: Review
- Level of consumption if Robinson Crusoe lives for two periods:
$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{1 + \beta} \left(Y_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + R} Y_{2}\right)
$$
- Consumption at time  $t$  is a fraction of the present value of life-time income
- Consumption at time  $t$  only depends on current income in so far as it affects the present value of life-time income

# Does the Model Fit the Data?
- No
What does it miss?
- Model implies a constant growth rate of consumption (Euler equation)
- Data show a hump shaped pattern of consumption over the life cycle
- Consumption profile seems to mimic income profile, while model says it shouldn't
# What Is Wrong with the Model?
- People are not forward looking?
- Well, they do save for retirement
- People's preferences change over time?
- Need more consumption when have young children (Gourinchas-Parker try to take this into account)
- People can't borrow against future income?
- Young people want to build up buffer stock of savings ("rainy day fund")?
# How to Make Sense of Evidence?
# Gourinchas and Parker (2002):
$$
\beta <   1 + R
$$

People are impatient

- Want downward sloping consumption profile
- But are borrowing constrained earlier in life
- Engage in precautionary savings early in life
- Save for retirement late in life

# Consumption-Saving
# - Three important ideas:
1. Consumption smoothing
- Diminishing marginal utility implies that households should borrow when income is low and save when income is high
2. Borrowing constraints
- Prevent households from smoothing consumption as much as they would like
3. Precautionary savings
Even when income is low, might want to build up buffer stock of savings as a precaution against future setbacks
# History of Thought

John Maynard Keynes introduced idea of the consumption function in the 1930's

- Consumption a function of current income
$$
C_{t} = a + b Y_{t}
$$
- $b$  denotes marginal propensity to consume
$-0 < b < 1$ , MPC between zero and one
- Argued that interest rate was unimportant
- Tryggve Haavelmo and Paul Samuelson provided early estimates of  $MPC > 2 / 3$
- Correlation vs. causation??
# History of Thought
- Keynes' consumption function implied:
- Savings rate should rise as country gets richer
- Some economists worried that there wouldn't be enough profitable investment to absorb increase in savings. This would lead to stagnation.
- In 1940's Simon Kuznetz gathered data on GDP and consumption back to 1860's.
- Consumption turned out to be stable as a share of GDP. Savings rate did not seem to rise as economy grew
# History of Thought

Dorothy Brady and Rose D. Friedman (1947):

- Re-analyzed budget study data
- Consumption function shifts up over time as average income increases
- Margret Reid (unpublished):
- Re-analyzed budget study data
- Introduced the concept of "permanent component of income"
"dealt a fatal blow to this extraordinarily simple view of the savings process" (i.e. the Keynesian consumption function)
---Modigliani (1986)
# History of Thought
- In the 1950's Franco Modigliano (and co-authors) proposed the life-cycle hypothesis:
- Consumers smooth consumption relative to income (e.g., save for retirement)
- Consumers are forward-looking
- Savings rate not related to level of income but rather current income relative to average income over life
- Savings rate doesn't rise with life-time income
# History of Thought
- In 1957, Milton Friedman proposed the permanent income effect (developed with Brady, Rose Friedman, and Reid)
- Consumption not related to current income but rather "permanent income"
- MPC out of "windfall" much lower than what Keynesians say, perhaps about 1/3
- Why  $1 / 3$  as opposed to  $1 / 45$ ? (Today we use the term permanent income hypothesis for a model that implies  $\mathrm{MPC} = 1 / 45$ )
# History of Thought
- Empirical Evidence in 1950's and 1960's:
- Spending out of unanticipated payments in 1950 to U.S. veterans holding National Service Life Insurance was between 0.3 and 0.5
- Spending out of reparations payments by Germany to Israelis in 1957-58 was about 0.2
# History of Thought
- In 1978, Robert Hall writes down model much like ours and argues for a MPC of 0.05.
- Also, consumption should be a random walk (with trend because of interest rate)
- Only unanticipated changes in income should affect consumption (anticipated changes should already be factored into consumption since people are forward-looking)
- In 1982, Hall and Mishkin (1982) estimate MPC to consume of 0.2 and conclude model is wrong because MPC is too high.
# History of Thought
# Since 1980:

Economists incorporate borrowing constraints and precautionary savings due to uncertainty about the future into model

- This raises MPC in the model back up to 0.2-0.4

# Growth Is A Modern Phenomenon

Real wages stagnant before 1800

- Sizable fluctuations before 1800, but not growth
- Growth begin around 1800 in Britain (and then spread)
18 and 19 century Britain is a major turning point in history which we now refer to as the Industrial Revolution
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/e1c78906abf4590db2753da10bb498a4dcb6ab718fc1bd547eed1c813c6ef70f.jpg)
Figure 1: Real Wages of Laborers in England from 1250 to 2000
# Key Questions About Origins of Growth
- Why was there no growth before the Industrial Revolution?
- Why did the Industrial Revolution happen?
- Why did it happen in  $18^{\text{th}}$  and  $19^{\text{th}}$  century?
- Why did it happen in Britain?
- Why did the Industrial Revolution result in modern sustained growth? (Why didn't it peter out like earlier "golden ages"?)
# Why No Growth Before the Industrial Revolution?
- Despotism: Those that grew rich got attacked by poorer neighbors
- Lack of freedom: Slavery and serfdom widespread. Cage of norms impedes occupational freedom.
- Vested interests favoring status quo: Powerful forces working against innovation and change
- Population dynamics: Higher wages lead to population growth, which pushed down wages
# Malthus' Idea
- In 1798, Thomas Malthus published an essay titled An Essay on the Principle of Population
- Argued that sustained growth in real wages was impossible in the long run
- If real wages increased, this would lead to an increase in population that would only stop when wages had been bid down to subsistence
Malthus' Unfortunate Timing

# Malthus Model: Production
# 1. Production Function:
$$
Y_{t} = A_{t} D^{a} L_{t}^{1 - a}
$$
- $Y_{t}$  denotes output at time t
- $A_{t}$  denotes productivity at time t
- $D$  denotes land (constant over time)
- $L_{t}$  denotes labor at time t
- Production function is constant returns to scale in land and labor. But land is fixed.
- There are diminishing returns to labor alone.
# Malthus Model: Labor Demand
# 2. Labor Demand:
- We assume that there is a competitive labor market. As in lecture 2, firms will hire labor to the point at which wage is equal to marginal product of labor
$$ w_{t} = (1 - a) A_{t} \left(\frac{D}{L_{t}}\right)^{a}
$$
# Malthus Model: Labor Supply
# 3. Labor Supply:
- Labor supply equals hours per person times population:
$$
L_{t} = H_{t} N_{t}
$$
- For simplicity:  $H_{t} = H$  (hours constant)
- We abstract from the labor-leisure decision discussed in lecture 3
# Malthus Model: Population Growth
# 4. Population Growth:

Population growth governed by real wage:

$$
N_{t + 1} = \frac{w_{t}}{w^{s}} N_{t}
$$
- $w^{S}$  "subsistence" wage
- Population will grow when standard of living is above subsistence
# Malthus Model: Population Growth
- People have a natural tendency to continually produce children
- Absent "checks" on this, population will grow
- "Positive checks" increase death rate (war, disease, severe labor, poverty)
- "Preventive checks" reduce birth rate (birth control, delayed marriage, infrequent coitus)
- Simplest formulation: Abject poverty only check that is sufficiently strong to stop population growth
# Malthus Model: Population Growth
- Rewrite equation as:
$$
N_{t + 1} = \frac{w_{t}}{w^{s}} N_{t} \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{N_{t + 1}}{N_{t}} = \frac{w_{t}}{w^{s}}
$$
- Population grows whenever wages are above subsistence ( $w_{t} > w^{s}$ )
- Population shrinks whenever wages are below subsistence ( $w_{t} < w^{s}$ )
# Malthus Model: Plagues

One more element important to make sense of data in middle ages: Plagues

- Plagues: Exogenous shock to population growth  $\xi_{t}$
- Population growth equation becomes:
$$
\frac{N_{t + 1}}{N_{t}} = \left(\frac{w_{t}}{w^{s}}\right) \xi_{t}
$$
- Years with no plague  $\xi_{t} = 1$
Years with plague  $\xi_{t} < 1$
# The Malthus Model: Key Equations
$$ w_{t} = (1 - a) A_{t} \left(\frac{D}{H N_{t}}\right)^{a}
$$
$$
\frac{N_{t + 1}}{N_{t}} = \left(\frac{w_{t}}{w^{s}}\right) \xi_{t}
$$

How many endogenous variables?

- Two for each time period:  $w_{t}$  and  $N_{t+1}$
- What about  $N_{t}$ ? It is endogenous in the previous period.
- What about  $N_{0}$ ? It is exogenous (initial condition)
- Dynamic model:
Population growth equation links period  $t$  and period  $t + 1$
- Solution at period  $t + 1$  depends on outcome in period  $t$
# Population Dynamics
- Let's plug the labor demand equation into the population growth equation :
$$
\frac{N_{t + 1}}{N_{t}} = \left(\frac{w_{t}}{w^{s}}\right) \xi_{t}
$$
$$
\frac{N_{t + 1}}{N_{t}} = \left(\frac{(1 - a) A_{t}}{w^{s}}\right) \left(\frac{D}{H N_{t}}\right)^{a} \xi_{t}
$$
# Population Dynamics
$$
N_{t + 1} = \phi A_{t} \xi_{t} N_{t}^{1 - a}
$$

# Population Dynamics
$$
N_{t + 1} = \phi A_{t} \xi_{t} N_{t}^{1 - a}
$$
- Suppose for simplicity that
$$
A_{t} = 1 \mathrm{an d} \xi_{t} = 1
$$
$$
N_{t + 1} = \phi N_{t}^{1 - a}
$$
- If  $\phi N_{t}^{1 - a} > N_{t}$  then  $N_{t + 1} > N_{t}$
- If  $\phi N_{t}^{1 - a} < N_{t}$  then  $N_{t + 1} < N_{t}$
- If  $\phi N_{t}^{1 - a} = N_{t}$  then  $N_{t + 1} = N_{t}$

# Steady State Population
$$
N_{t + 1} = \phi A_{t} \xi_{t} N_{t}^{1 - a}
$$
- A steady state for  $N_{t}$  is a value for  $N_{t}$  at which  $N_{t+1} = N_{t}$ , i.e., the population is "steady"
- Population will reach such a point after long period of no "shocks" (e.g.,  $\xi_{t} = 1$  and  $A_{t} = 1$ )
- We denote steady state for  $N_{t}$  by  $\overline{N}$
- We can solve for the steady state analytically
# Solving for Steady State
1. Suppose there is a steady state  $\overline{N}$ . Then  $N_{t+1} = N_t = \overline{N}$ . So, replace  $N_{t+1}$  and  $N_t$  with  $\overline{N}$  in population dynamics equation. Also, set shocks to normal values (i.e.,  $\xi_t = 1$ ):
$$
\overline {{N}} = \phi A_{t} \overline {{N}}^{1 - a}
$$
2. Solve for  $\overline{N}$ :
$$
\overline {{N}} = (\phi A_{t})^{\frac{1}{a}}
$$

1. Population dynamics plot ( $N_{t+1}$  against  $N_t$ )
$$
N_{t + 1} = \phi A_{t} \xi_{t} N_{t}^{1 - a}
$$
2. Labor demand plot ( $w_{t}$  against  $N_{t}$ )
$$ w_{t} = (1 - a) A_{t} \left(\frac{D}{H N_{t}}\right)^{a}
$$
3. Time-series plot of population ( $N_{t}$  against  $t$ )
4. Time-series plot of wages ( $w_{t}$  against  $t$ )
# Responses to Shocks
- What happens to population and wages in the short run and long run after these shocks:
1. Black Death ( $\xi_{t} < 1$ )?
2. Increase in technology ( $A_0 > 1$ )?

# Responses to Shocks
- What happens to population and wages in the short run and long run after these shocks:
- Black Death  $(\xi_{t} < 1)$ ?
- Population falls in the short run but returns to same steady state.
- Wages rise in the short run but then fall to same steady state
- Increase in technology  $(A_0 > 1)$ ?
- Population begins to grow and grows to new steady state
- Wages rise in the short run but then fall to same steady state
# Wages in England 1250-1860
- Can we use the Malthus model to make sense of the evolution of real wages in England from 1250 onward?
- Two striking facts:
- No growth (same in 1750 as in 1250)
- Big rise (13001450) and then fall (1450 to 1640)
- Malthus model suggests that evolution of the population may help us understand changes in real wages

# Real Wages of Laborers in England 1250-1640

12501310:

Population rises and real wages fall

13101450:

- Population falls and real wages rise
- Black Death in 1340s. Waves of plagues afterwards
14501640:
- Population rises and real wages fall
Economy "recovers" from plagues
# Success of Malthus Model
- Big rise and fall of real wages may have seemed puzzling before
- Malthus model provides an explanation:
- Real wages rose as plagues halved the population
- Real wages fell as population recovered
# Technical Change in England 1250-1640

12501640:

- Real wages and population moved up and down a stable labor demand curve
$$ w_{t} = \phi w^{s} A_{t} \frac{1}{N_{t}^{a}}
$$

What does this imply about changes in productivity in England from 1250 to 1640?

- There was essentially no change in productivity  $(A_{t} = \bar{A})$ .
No technical change. (Why?)
- Increases in  $A_{t}$  shift the labor demand curve out

# Something Changed Around 1650
- Points move off the curve!!
What does this mean about productivity?
- Productivity started increasing ( $A_{t}$  started growing)
- From 1640-1730: Mostly increase in wages
— Great Plague of London in 1665-6
From 17301800: Mostly increase in population
- Recovery from plagues? Increase in health? Engel's pause?
- Around 1800: Huge acceleration

# Malthus' Unfortunate Timing
- Malthus sometimes get a bad rap
- Prediction that wages were doomed to stay at subsistence turned out to be wrong after his writing
- But his theory was arguably correct for all of history up until his writing!!
What changed after 1800?
# Why Is World No Longer Malthusian?
1. Technological growth overwhelmed Malthusian forces
Population forces Malthus emphasized are slow
- Fast enough technology growth my overwhelm them
2. Land less important in production
— Existence of a fix factor of production (land) important for logic of Malthus model
- Land became much less important after 1800 due to invention of the steam engine
- Land no longer needed to produce energy
# Why is World No Long Malthusian?
# 3. Demographic Transition
- Data on birth rates and death rates support Malthus' model quite well up until 1825
- After 1825, relationship between birth rates and real wages assumed by Malthus breaks down (and particularly after 1880)
# Demographic Transition in England

# Demographic Transition
- High wages no longer associated with high population growth in England
- Same pattern observed for all countries when they develop
- Why did birth rates fall?
- Improved contraceptive methods
- Trade-off between quantity and "quality" of children?
- Women's empowerment

# Why Did Industrial Revolution Happen?
- Not a settled issue! (Very contentious, actually)
- We discuss four strands of thought:
1. Changes to Institutions
2. The Enlightenment
3. The Agricultural Revolution
4. The role of high wages and cheap coal
# INSTITUTIONS
# What Happened in the 1640s?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/e215ea4a853a59054eae48abe31b9b74be237b34f2434917e54ec491dd886664.jpg)

# England in the  $17^{\text{th }}$  Century
- Two revolutions: 1640s and 1688
- Civil War in 1640's:
— Parliamentarians overthrow Charles I and set up Commonwealth
- Great deal of institutional change
- Growth despite much turmoil!!
- "Glorious" Revolution of 1688:
- Formalization of constitutional monarchy in England
- Marxist historians stress revolution of 1640s, while Whig history stresses Glorious Revolution of 1688
# Growth Began at a Time of Institutional Change

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/952f1a2943243fbf3db202e0f35022aaf909e2230d900aaf073f3dca7eaf7994.jpg)

# North and Weingast (1989)
- The fundamental barrier to growth before Glorious Revolution was despotism of sovereign
- The sovereign faced a commitment problem
- Would like to promise to respect property rights of citizens. Why?
- Because this provides citizens with good incentives to invest and produce more (yielding higher taxes)
- Why is it hard to make such a promise credible?
- Once citizens have amassed wealth, sovereign has irresistible temptation to renegade and confiscate wealth (especially in time of war)
# Commitment Problem
- Ex-ante: Sovereign wants to promise to respect property rights
- Ex-post: Sovereign wants to renegade and expropriate
- Subjects understand this. Don't believe initial promise
— Promise is not credible
- Sovereign has a commitment problem
- Parent says to child: "If you don't eat your vegetables, you won't get ice cream."
- Child may understand that this is not a credible threat
- Government says to banks: "If you get into trouble, we will not bail you out."
— Banks may understand that this is not a credible threat
# Commitment Problem
- How can we solve commitment problems?
— Reputation (when play is repeated)
- Weight current profit against future loss
- Need long horizon
- Commitment devices:
- Odysseus tied himself to the mast
- Cortez burned the boats he arrived on in Mexico
- Enforceable contracts
- Constitutions
- Balance of power
- The Civil War and Glorious Revolution resulted in dramatic institutional change
- Power of the Crown reduced
- Power of Parliament enhanced
- Stable power-sharing arrangement between Crown, Parliament, Courts.
- Improved incentives of citizens to innovate and invest

# The Role of Atlantic Trade
- Atlantic trade highly profitable after Great Discoveries
- In Britain/Netherlands, created merchant class that demanded better institutions
- In Spain/Portugal(/France) dominated by Crown
- Mediterranean countries (Venice/Baltics) didn't have access

# THE ENLIGHTENMENT
# Technological Innovation
- Huge increase in speed of technical innovation
- Textiles: Spinning jenny, water frame, mule, etc.
- Steam: Newcomen engine, separate condenser, rotary engine, high pressure engine, etc.
- Coke smelting, railroads, etc.
- "A wave of gadgets swept over England" (Ashton, 1948)
- Why did technological innovation take off?
# A Theory of the Enlightenment
- Perhaps there was an unusual clustering of talented and freethinking individuals in Northwestern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries
- Seems unlikely!
- Plenty of smart and freethinking individuals have likely lived in all places at all times
- So, why have so few ideas survived from other times and places?
- Perhaps because they were suppressed/lost
- Freethinkers are often a threat to the ruling elite
# A Theory of the Enlightenment
- Whether the ideas survive depends on the relative strength of:
- Forces/technologies seeking to suppress new ideas
- Forces/technologies seeking to spread new ideas
- At most times/places, the forces/technologies seeking to suppress new ideas had upper hand  $\rightarrow$  stagnation
- But then something changed!
# A Theory of the Enlightenment
- Watershed moment: invention of the movable-type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1450
- Massively altered the balance of power between those seeking to suppress knowledge and those seeking to spread it
- Led to Reformation  $\rightarrow$  Enlightenment  $\rightarrow$  Industrial Revolution
- Martin Luther master pamphleteer (ideas spread too fast to suppress)
- Earlier reformers didn't have this technology to spread their ideas
- Reformation emphasized literacy
— Protestant areas relaxed censorship. Crucial for Enlightenment.
# Rise in Literacy
- Literacy rates seem to have been extremely low throughout most of history
0.9
1.8
- Rose rapidly in England over 250 years before Industrial Revolution
- Protestant churches encouraged 0.5 literacy 0.4
- Price of books fell by more than a factor of 20
- 0.3

# Evidence on Role of Enlightenment/Reformation?
- Speculative theory
- Can we provide any "hard evidence" for it?
- Quite difficult
- Becker and Woessmann (2009) provide interesting attempt
- Did Protestantism cause growth in  $19^{\text{th }}$  century Prussia?
- Max Weber: Protestant Ethic
- But perhaps literacy is key channel
# Protestant Prosperity
- Protestantism correlated with prosperity around 1900
- But a correlation doesn't prove causation!
- Perhaps Protestant areas differed in other way and this explains their prosperity
How can we test whether Protestantism caused prosperity?
- We need "exogenous variation" in Protestantism
- Becker-Woessmann propose "distance to Wittenberg"
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/d540ba76e41ca19ee0b64eaa53ca47a443efd6fcb090df935d79312a08f06fb0.jpg)
Figure 8: Protestant Population Share in Prussia in 1871
# Structure of the Argument
1. First Stage: Is distance to Wittenberg correlated with Protestantism?
2. Balance Tests: Were areas close to Wittenberg different in other ways?
3. Reduced Form: Is distance to Wittenberg correlated with prosperity?
- Becker and Woessmann use data on Prussian counties in late  $19^{\text{th }}$  century
# Is Distance to Wittenberg Different in Other Ways?
- Becker and Woessmann assume: Nothing special about Wittenberg when it comes to prosperity other than it being center of Protestant revolution
- Can they corroborate this assumption?
- Distance to Wittenberg is not correlated with proxies for economic and educational development prior to Reformation

# Distance to Wittenberg and Prosperity
- Final step: Show that distance to Wittenberg is correlated with prosperity
- If DIST is uncorrelated with all determinants of PROSP other than PROT, then any correlation between DIST and PROSP must be due to PROT.

# THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION
# Agricultural Revolution
Population of England tripled from 1700 to 1850
- Very little imports of food
- Share of population working in agriculture fell
- Massive increase in agricultural productivity
- Did Agricultural Revolution cause Industrial Revolution?
- Or did Industrial Revolution cause Agricultural Revolution?
# Agricultural Revolution
- Proximate causes:
- 1) Improvements in land, 2) Intensive crop rotations,
3) breeding of higher yield animals and crops
- Crop rotations:
- Traditional rotation: 1) Wheat or rye, 2) Barley or oats, 3) fallow
- New rotation: 1) Wheat, 2) Turnips, 3) Barley, 4) Clover
- Clover a legume (nitrogen fixing)
- Turnips/Clover used as feed for animals
- Much larger animal herds yielded lots of natural fertilizer
- Why did this not happen much earlier?
# The Enclosure Movement
- Before 1500:
Villages with three open fields + commons
- Each farmer owned several strips + rights to use commons
After 1850:
- Ancient system swept away by thousands of “enclosure” acts and agreements
- Replaced by modern system of private property rights
- Very controversial!
One view:
Rationalization of property right
- Crucial for innovation / Ag. Revolution
- Another view:
- Massive act of expropriation by large landowners of complex system of antient peasant rights
- Enclosed farms were more efficient, but open farms also increased yields substantially
# Rural Growth and Urban Growth: Did One Cause the Other?
- Industrial Revolution could not happen without Agricultural Revolution: Food surplus needed to support urban growth
- But not obvious which way causation goes
- AR → IR: Ag Prod. Increases → pushes people out of Ag → People move to city and pursue trade/industry/innovation
- IR → AR: Returns to trade/industry rise → Pulls people into cities → Higher ag prices spur innovation in Ag
- How can we tell these stories apart?
# $\mathrm{AR} \rightarrow \mathrm{IR}$  or  $\mathrm{IR} \rightarrow \mathrm{AR}$
- How can we tell these two stories apart?
- Allen (2009): Different implications about urban wages
- AR → IR: People pushed out of country-side → low urban wages
- IR → AR: People pulled into cities → high urban wages
# $\mathrm{AR} \rightarrow \mathrm{IR}$  or  $\mathrm{IR} \rightarrow \mathrm{AR}$

Figure 11: Labor Productivity in Agriculture in Europe Regions
Agricultural Revolution happens in places with high urban wages
# Decline of Feudalism and Rise of Capitalism
- Medieval England was a feudal society
— Crown, lords, freehold farmers, serfs
- Gradual increase in freedom/property rights/rule of law
— Royal courts gradually protected freeholds from lords (Common Law)
- Black Death led to collapse of serfdom and early enclosures
- Crown reacted to expropriation by gradual protection of tenant farmers
- By  $17^{\text{th }}$  century: Rise of yeoman farmers with substantial proprietary interest in the soil (and thus incentive to innovate)
- Contrast: More intense serfdom in E. Europe after Black Death
# HIGH WAGES AND CHEAP COAL
# Why Britain?
- Industrial Revolution very concentrated in Britain
- Newcomen steam engine, separate condenser, high pressure steam engine, flying shuttle, spinning jenny, water frame, mule, coke smelting furnace, etc.
- In 1500: Britain relatively unimportant island off of NW Europe
- By 1800: Industrial powerhouse / global empire
What was so special about Britain?
# Allen (2009): High Wages and Cheap Coal
- High wages and cheap coal gave British strong incentive to produce labor-saving innovations
- “The Industrial Revolution, in short, was invented in Britain in the eighteenth century because it paid to invent it there, while it would not have been profitable to invent in other times and places.”
# Directed Technical Change
- High wages? How can that be an advantage? Shouldn’t that make British industry less competitive?
- But it spurs labor-saving innovation
- Industrial Revolution was about the invention of machines
- Needed high wages to make it profitable to invent machines
- Machines use a lot of energy.
- Need cheap energy to invent machines
# Ecological Bottleneck
- Pre-industrial economy was very land intensive
- Food land intensive
- Energy land intensive
- Feed for animals / Firewood
- Energy necessary for growth
- Land intensity of energy was a severe bottleneck

Notes: Energy is measured in petajoules. The source of these estimates is Table 2.1 of Wrigley (2010). The numbers for farm animals and the population are estimates of calories consumed. Wind energy includes sail ships. The firewood number for 1850s is actually for the 1840s.
# Why Was Steam Engine Invented in England?
- Explosive growth of London led to “timber crisis”
- Led to huge growth in coal industry to heat London houses
Large demand to drain coal mines
- Strong incentive to invent engine that could help drain coal mines
- First steam engine very inefficient. But coal was free at coal fields

Notes: Costs are reported pence per pound at 1784 prices. The data are from Table 8.1 of Allen (2009). The "count" of cotton yarn measures the number of hanks  $(770\mathrm{m})$  of yarn that make one pound of yarn. The higher is the count, the finer the yarn. 16 count yarn is relatively coarse, similar to the yarn used for modern jeans.
# Lecture 7 Capital Accumulation and Growth
Macroeconomics (Quantitative)
Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# The Rise of Capital
- Pre-Industrial times:
- Land important factor of production
Quantity of land fixed
- Major impediment to growth
- Industrial Revolution: Land intensity falls …
- Fossil fuels replace firewood / animal power
- Food share of consumption falls
- … importance of capital rises
- Wave of machines are invented
- Capital is fundamentally different from land
- It can be accumulated through investment!
1800 - 1950:
- Industrial nations (UK, US, France, Germany, etc.) accumulated a great deal of capital and grew rapidly
Stalinist Soviet Union: Five year plans emphasize capital accumulation and growth takes off
- Many other regions lag behind
# Capital Accumulation and Growth
- Widely held belief in 1950s:
- Capital accumulation is key to growth (the "elixir" in Easterly's words)
- Krugman and Easterly readings discuss this history
- Common development advice:
- To grow faster, poor countries must increase investment rate
- Does this make sense theoretically?
Robert Solow addressed this question in a seminal 1956 article
# Production
- Firm's production function:
$$
Y_{t} = \bar {A} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3}
$$
- Firms hire labor and rent capital in competitive markets (same as in lecture 2)
- Households:
- Supply a fixed amount of labor:  $\bar{L}$
- Own capital stock. Decide how much to consume and how much to invest in new capital
# Consumption-Savings Decision
- Two ways to go:
- Maximize utility  $\rightarrow$  consumption Euler equation
- Rule of thumb (shortcut to simplify model)
- Solow model assumes rule of thumb behavior for household savings:
- Households save a constant fraction of their income  $\bar{s} Y_{t}$
(Notice that income is equal to output since households "own" both labor and capital and there are no profits)
# Savings, Investment and Consumption
- Savings:  $\bar{s} Y_{t}$
- Investment?
- Well, it has to equal savings!
$$
I_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t}
$$
- Consumption?
- Whatever is not saved is consumed
$$
C_{t} = Y_{t} - I_{t}
$$
# Capital Accumulation
$$
K_{t + 1} = K_{t} + I_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
- Capital tomorrow is equal to:
- Capital today
- Plus investment
- Minus depreciation: Assume constant faction of capital stock "wears out" each period.
- Assume an initial capital stock:  $K_{0}$
<table><tr><td>Time, t</td><td>Capital, Kt</td><td>Investment, It</td><td>Depreciation, dKt</td><td>Change in capital, ΔKt</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1,000</td><td>200</td><td>100</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1,100</td><td>200</td><td>110</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1,190</td><td>200</td><td>119</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1,271</td><td>200</td><td>127</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1,344</td><td>200</td><td>134</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1,410</td><td>200</td><td>141</td><td>59</td></tr></table>
The last column is found by applying the capital accumulation equation:  $\Delta K_{t} = I_{t} - \overline{d} K_{t}$ . That is, it is computed by taking the difference between the two prior columns. The next period's capital stock is then the sum of  $K_{t}$  and  $\Delta K_{t}$ .

# Dynamic Model
- The Solow model is a dynamic model (like Malthus model)
- Describes evolution of economy over time (not just at one moment)
- Five equations for each point in time
# The Solow Model
1. Firm's production function:
2. Labor supply exogenously given:
3. Investment equal to savings:
4. Consumption:
5. Capital accumulation:
$$
\begin{array}{l} Y_{t} = \bar {A} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3} \\ L_{t} = \overline {{L}} \\ I_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} \\ C_{t} = Y_{t} - I_{t} \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
K_{t + 1} = K_{t} + I_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
# What about Labor and Capital Demand?
- We didn't talk about:
- Wage
- Rental rate on capital
- Think of them as being in the background
- Not needed to solve rest of model
- Two more equations and two more endogenous variables (labor demand and capital demand)
# Solving the Solow Model
1. Combine:
$$
I_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} \quad \mathrm{an d} \quad K_{t + 1} = K_{t} + I_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$ to get:
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
- Interpretation:
LHS: Change in capital stock
RHS: “Net” investment (investment minus depreciations)
# Solving the Solow Model
2. Combine:
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$ and
$$
Y_{t} = \bar {A} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3} \quad \mathrm{as we ll as} \quad L_{t} = \bar {L}
$$ to get:
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
# Evolution of Capital in Solow Model
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
- This is the key equation in the Solow Model
- Describes the evolution of the capital stock
- We solve this equation graphically – Very similar to Malthus model
# Drawing the Solow Graph
- Investment:
$$
I_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} = \bar {s} \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3}
$$
- Depreciation:
$$
\bar {d} K_{t}
$$

# Economy starts at  $K_{0}$ :
Investment, Depreciation
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/95910e533e8688aa8651a93f2158289afcc0da3a41f9af9fc2f7894317c927ea.jpg)
- We see that the orange line is above the green at  $K_{0}$ :
- Investment is greater than depreciation
- So  $\Delta K_{t} > 0$  because
$$
\Delta K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - d K_{t}
$$
- Then since  $\Delta K_{\mathrm{t}} > 0$ ,  $K_{\mathrm{t}}$  increases from  $K_{0}$  to  $K_{1} > K_{0}$
# Now imagine if we start at a  $K_{0}$  here:
Investment, Depreciation
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/56208e3c7368b293faebe3d86c2ed9683042c35b331f36163446546225715342.jpg)
- At  $\mathrm{K}_{0}$ , the green line is above the orange line
- Saving = investment is now less than depreciation
- So  $\Delta K_{t}<0$  because
$$
\Delta K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - d K_{t}
$$
- Then since  $\Delta K_{t} < 0$ ,  $K_{t}$  decreases from  $K_{0}$  to  $K_{1} < K_{0}$

# Evolution of Capital
- If investment is greater than depreciation, capital stock rises.
- Capital continues to rise until investment and depreciation are equal. At this point capital stock stops growing
- Growth process is referred to as transition dynamics
- Point at which capital stops growing is called the steady state
# Solving for Steady State Capital
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
- Definition of steady state: Point were
$$
K_{t + 1} = K_{t} = \overline {{K}}
$$
- Key idea: Replace all  $K_{t+1}$  and  $K_t$  with  $\overline{K}$
$$
\bar {s} \overline {{A}} \overline {{L}}^{2 / 3} \overline {{K}}^{1 / 3} = \bar {d} \overline {{K}}
$$
$$
\overline {{K}} = \left(\frac{\overline {{s}} \overline {{A}}}{\overline {{d}}}\right)^{3 / 2} \overline {{L}}
$$
# Output in the Solow Model
- Output is given by:
$$
Y_{t} = \bar {A} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3}
$$
- When capital grows, so does output
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/6bd777e0a50013d023b8ad8a0812ab914d1e2a82f212db352956d96a7b5c6256.jpg)
Capital,  $K_{t}$
# Consumption in the Solow Model
- Consumption is given by:
$$
C_{t} = Y_{t} - I_{t}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} C_{t} = (1 - \bar {s}) Y_{t} \\ = (1 - \bar {s}) \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Optimal Capital Accumulation
- Higher savings rate  $\rightarrow$  higher steady state output
- Does that mean that a high savings rate is good?
- Is a  $100 \%$ savings rate good?
- Maximizes capital stock and output
- But no consumption!
# Optimal Saving Rate
- Suppose a policymaker can choose the savings rate.
What savings rate should they choose?
- The rate that maximized output?
- No. The rate that maximizes consumption!
- Steady state value of capital that maximizes consumption: Golden rule level of capital
# Golden Rule Level of Capital
- Consumption is output minus investment:
$$
\bar {C} = \bar {Y} - \bar {I}
$$
- Steady state output:
$$
\overline {{Y}} = \overline {{A}} \overline {{L}}^{2 / 3} \overline {{K}}^{1 / 3}
$$
- Steady state investment:
$$
\bar {I} = \bar {d} \bar {K}
$$
# Deriving the Golden Rule
- Consumption
$$
\bar {C} = \bar {Y} - \bar {I}
$$
$$
\bar {C} = \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} \bar {K}^{1 / 3} - \bar {d} \bar {K}
$$
- To maximize consumption:
- Differentiate with respect to  $\overline{K}$  and set to zero
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac{1}{3} \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} \bar {K}^{- 2 / 3} = \bar {d} \\ M P K = \bar {d} \\ \end{array}
$$
# Golden Rule Level of Capital
Steady state Output, Investment
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/df3a13d2-4589-4162-8046-0acf25cecbff/85fa71d21d0bc53c961e8ddf0c54fdc5df8ca31581daa9fb6ffcc10710ae493b.jpg)
# Oversaving?
- Many countries worry that savings are too low
- Some countries have very high savings rates:
- China for last 15 years
— Soviet Union in mid 20 century
- China and Soviet Union may be / have been “on the wrong side of the Golden Rule”
# Moving to the Golden Rule
- Consider a situation in which an economy starts off in a steady state with too much capital
- Derive transition
- Consider a situation in which an economy starts off in a steady state with too little capital
- Derive transition
Key difference:
- When economy begins above the Golden Rule, reaching Golden rule produces higher consumption at all points in time.
- When economy begins below the Golden Rule, reaching Golden rule requires initially reducing consumption to increase consumption later on.
# Growth in the Solow Model
What does the Solow model teach us about long run growth?
- There is no long run growth in the Solow Model!!
- Capital, output and consumption settle down to constant steady state values
- A central lesson from the Solow Model:
- Capital accumulation cannot serve as an engine for long run growth
# Why Is There a Steady State?
- Capital and output converge to a constant level in the Solow model
- What feature of the model generates this result?
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} \bar {A} \bar {L}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
# Diminishing Returns to Capital
- Diminishing returns to investment in capital
- Depreciation is linear (constant returns)
- Eventually investment returns can’t keep up with depreciation
- This results in growth converging to zero (i.e. a steady state for capital, output etc.)
# Investment and Growth
# Development economics of the 1950's:
- Arthur Lewis: Surplus labor model
— Army of surplus labor in country side
- Capital only constraint on output
- Output proportional to growth since “surplus labor” can be soaked up from country side
- Aka Harrod-Domar model (Domar never endorsed this)
# Harrod-Domar/Surplus Labor Model
- Hugely influential at World Bank etc.
- Policy implication:
- To double growth one just needs to double investment
- Common belief: Poor can’t save/borrow enough
- Policy implication:
- “Financing gap”: Difference between national savings and “required investment.” Foreign aid can fill this gap.
- "Empirical evidence": Soviet takeoff
- But Soviet Union differed in many other ways from poor countries
# Investment: Elixir of Growth? Or Not?
# Easterly:
- Harrod-Domar/Surplus Labor model doesn’t fit the facts.
- Investment neither sufficient nor necessary for growth
- Surplus labor idea not reasonable
- If there is lots of surplus labor, wages will fall and firms will use more labor intensive production methods

# Population Growth in Solow Model
What if we have population growth?
$$
L_{t + 1} = L_{t} (1 + \bar {n})
$$
- Then we have:
$$
\begin{array}{l} K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t} \\ Y_{t} = \bar {A} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3} \\ \end{array}
$$
(same as before except  $L_{t}$  as opposed to  $\overline{L}$ )
- How do we solve the model in this case?
- No longer a steady state in  $K_{t}$
- $\bar{s} Y_{t}$  is constantly shifting up since  $L_{t}$  is growing
# Solving the Model with Pop Growth
- Trick: Divide though by  $L_{t}$
- Write entire model in terms of per capita variables
- Let's do this for the production function:
$$
Y_{t} = \bar {A} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3}
$$
It becomes:
$$ y_{t} = \bar {A} k_{t}^{1 / 3}
$$ where lower case letters denote per capita (e.g.,  $y_{t} = Y_{t} / L_{t}$ )
# Solving the Model with Pop Growth
- Capital accumulation:
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
- Divide by  $L_{t}$ :
$$
\frac{K_{t + 1}}{L_{t}} - \frac{K_{t}}{L_{t}} = \bar {s} \frac{Y_{t}}{L_{t}} - \bar {d} \frac{K_{t}}{L_{t}}
$$
- Problem: What do we do about  $K_{t + 1} / L_t$ ?
# Solving the Model with Pop Growth
- Multiply and divide by  $L_{t + 1}$
$$
\frac{K_{t + 1}}{L_{t + 1}} \frac{L_{t + 1}}{L_{t}} - \frac{K_{t}}{L_{t}} = \bar {s} \frac{Y_{t}}{L_{t}} - \bar {d} \frac{K_{t}}{L_{t}}
$$
- Use population growth equation:
$$ k_{t + 1} (1 + \bar {n}) - k_{t} = \bar {s} y_{t} - \bar {d} k_{t}
$$
- Subtract  $\bar{n} k_{t}$  from both sides
$$
(1 + \bar {n}) (k_{t + 1} - k_{t}) = \bar {s} y_{t} - (\bar {d} + \bar {n}) k_{t}
$$
# Per Capita Steady State
- Finally, divide through by  $(1 + \bar{n})$
$$
(k_{t + 1} - k_{t}) = \frac{1}{1 + \bar {n}} \left[ \bar {s} y_{t} - (\bar {d} + \bar {n}) k_{t} \right]
$$
- This yields a steady state for per capita variables
- In steady state:
- Per capita output, capital and consumption constant
- What will growth rate of the level of output, capital and consumption be?
# Steady State with Population Growth
$$
(k_{t + 1} - k_{t}) = \frac{1}{1 + \bar {n}} \left[ \bar {s} y_{t} - (\bar {d} + \bar {n}) k_{t} \right]
$$
$$
0 = \frac{1}{1 + \bar {n}} \left[ \bar {s} \bar {y} - (\bar {d} + \bar {n}) \bar {k} \right]
$$
$$
0 = \left[ \bar {s} \bar {A} \bar {k}^{1 / 3} - (\bar {d} + \bar {n}) \bar {k} \right]
$$
$$
\overline {{k}} = \left(\frac{\overline {{s}} \overline {{A}}}{\overline {{d}} + \overline {{n}}}\right)^{3 / 2}
$$
$$ y_{t} = \bar {A} k_{t}^{1 / 3}
$$
$$
\bar {y} = \bar {A} \bar {k}^{1 / 3}
$$
$$
\bar {y} = \left(\frac{\bar {s}}{\bar {d} + \bar {n}}\right)^{1 / 2} \bar {A}^{3 / 2}
$$
- How does population growth  $(\overline{n})$  affect steady state output and capital per capita? (Why?)
# Growth in TFP
- Let's add TFP growth as well:
$$
A_{t + 1} = A_{t} (1 + \bar {g})
$$
One more little change:
$$
Y_{t} = A_{t}^{2 / 3} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3}
$$
- Think of this as a change of units for  $A_{t}$  (simplifies algebra)
- We also have:
$$
K_{t + 1} - K_{t} = \bar {s} Y_{t} - \bar {d} K_{t}
$$
$$
L_{t + 1} = L_{t} (1 + \bar {n})
$$
# How Do We Solve This Model?
- Two things growing!
- Same trick as before:
- Divide by variables that are growing:  $L_{t}A_{t}$
- Capital and output per “effective” worker:
$$
\widehat {k}_{t} = \frac{K_{t}}{L_{t} A_{t}} \qquad \widehat {y}_{t} = \frac{Y_{t}}{L_{t} A_{t}}
$$
# Write Model in Per Effective Worker Variables
- Similar algebra as before yields:
$$
\hat {y}_{t} = \hat {k}_{t}^{1 / 3}
$$
$$
\widehat {k}_{t + 1} - \widehat {k}_{t} = \frac{1}{(1 + \bar {n}) (1 + \bar {g})} \Big [ \bar {s} \widehat {y}_{t} - \Big (\bar {d} - 1 + (1 + \bar {n}) (1 + \bar {g}) \Big) \widehat {k}_{t} \Big ]
$$
# Steady State per Effective Worker
$$
\hat {k}_{t + 1} - \hat {k}_{t} = \frac{1}{(1 + \bar {n}) (1 + \bar {g})} \left[ \bar {s} \hat {y}_{t} - \left(\bar {d} - 1 + (1 + \bar {n}) (1 + \bar {g})\right) \hat {k}_{t} \right]
$$
- Model has a steady state for capital and output "per effective workers"
- In steady state:
- Output, capital and consumption per effective worker are constant
- What about output per person?
# Growth in Per Capita Income
$$
\hat {y}_{t} = \frac{Y_{t}}{A_{t} L_{t}}
$$
- Implies:
$$ g_{\hat {y}_{t}} = g_{Y / L} - g_{A}
$$
$$
0 = g_{Y / L} - g_{A}
$$
$$ g_{Y / L} = g_{A}
$$
# Growth Rates
- On the last slide we used the following type of growth rate rule:
$$ y_{t} = a_{t} k_{t}^{a} l_{t}^{1 - a}
$$
$$
\ln y_{t} = \ln a_{t} + a \ln k_{t} + (1 - a) \ln l_{t}
$$
$$
\ln y_{t} - \ln y_{t - 1} = \ln a_{t} - \ln a_{t - 1} + a (\ln k_{t} - \ln k_{t - 1}) + (1 - a) (\ln l_{t} - \ln l_{t - 1})
$$
$$ g_{y} = g_{a} + a g_{k} + (1 - a) g_{l}
$$
- Where last step uses first order approx.:  $\ln x = \ln x_0 + \frac{x - x_0}{x_0}$
# Exogenous Growth
- Technical progress yields growth in per capita output in the Solow model
- So, we know what types of things can yield long-run growth (anything that yields sustained growth in  $A_{t}$ )
- But technical progress is given exogenously
- Our theory of growth is thus limited
- We need a theory for growth in  $A_{t}$
# Growth in the Solow Model
- Capital accumulation cannot serve as engine for long run growth (due to diminishing return to capital)
- But perhaps the “long run” is really far off from a practical point of view
- Perhaps capital accumulation can play a big role for growth for quite some time
- Let's look at "growth miracles" and see if they are due to capital accumulation or TFP growth
# Growth “Miracle” of Asian “Tigers”
Growth of Asian "Tigers" 1966-1990:
Korea 10.3\%
Taiwan  $9.4\%$
Singapore 8.7\%
Hong Kong  $7.3\%$
- Is their growth driven by TFP growth or growth in factor inputs?
- Young (1995): Tyranny of Numbers
# Growth Accounting
$$
Y_{t} = A_{t} K_{t}^{1 / 3} L_{t}^{2 / 3}
$$
- Take logs and a first order approximation:
$$ g_{Y} = g_{A} + \frac{1}{3} g_{K} + \frac{2}{3} g_{L}
$$
- Where  $g$ 's denote growth rates
- We can measure  $g_{y}, g_{K}$ , and  $g_{L}$
This gives us  $g_{A}$  as a residual ("Total Factor Productivity growth" aka "Solow residual")

# Was it a Miracle?
- Young (1995):
- Growth driven primarily by growth in factor inputs
- TFP growth unremarkable
- Young's study came as a shock
- Many people’s reaction was that it was bad for some reason that growth was due to factor input growth
- Krugman (1994) questions sustainability based on the logic of the Solow model
# Was It a Miracle?
- Is it any less of an achievement?
- Asian Tigers were able to increase capital stock and labor supply by huge amounts
- Many other countries weren’t
- Why were they able to do this while other weren’t?

# TFP Growth in the U.S.
TFP growth accounts for more than  $50\%$  of growth in U.S. GDP per capita since WWII
- Most of the rest comes from K/L
- TFP growth much more important proportionally in U.S. than in case of Asian Tigers
# TFP Growth in the U.S.
1948-1973: Rapid TFP growth
Post-1973: Productivity slowdown
- Late 1980's and early 1990's: "Productivity Paradox"
- Major innovations in computing, fiber optics, etc.
- Continued slow growth in TFP
- Solow: "You can see the computer age every-where these days, except in the productivity statistics."
Productivity speedup in mid 1990's
- "New Economy" (internet, email made computers useful)

# Growth Miracles in the Solow Model
- What does the Solow model suggest as an explanation for high growth rates of e.g. Asian Tigers?
In the Solow Model:
- Countries below their steady state grow fast
Further below, faster you grow
- Countries above their steady state grow slow (contract)
- Perhaps this may explain differences in growth rates across countries (e.g., fast growing East Asian Tigers)

# Convergence in the Solow Model
$$

$$
- Output should converge if  $\bar{s}, \bar{d}, \bar{n}, \bar{A}$  are the same
- Perhaps this is more true for OECD countries than countries more generally
- Where is it even more likely to be true?

# Solow Model and Key Questions
1. Growth in the frontier
- Capital accumulation not a source of long run growth
Growth in the frontier due to changes in productivity
2. Behind the frontier
— Temporarily below due to history but converging
- Lower steady state (Why?)
# Lecture 8

# Ideas and Growth

What drives modern economic growth?

- Solow model: Capital Accumulation is not fundamental engine of growth
What about accumulation of knowledge?
- For knowledge to succeed where capital failed, there must be something fundamentally different about knowledge
# Objects Versus Ideas
# - Objects:
- Raw material of the universe
- Goods, services, capital, labor, land, barrels of oil, a particular lightbulb, a particular lawnmower, a particular oral rehydration pill, etc.
# - Ideas:
- Instructions for using the raw material of the universe
- How to make fire from sticks, how to make plastic from petroleum, how to make paper from trees, calculus, double-entry accounting, just-in-time inventory management, oral rehydration therapy, Beethoven's 3rd symphony, etc.
# What Is Special About Ideas?
# - Objects are rivalrous
- One person's use of an object reduces ability of other people to use that same object.
- E.g.: Computers, Accountants, Land
- Rivalry gives rise to scarcity
# - Ideas are non-rivalrous
- My use of calculus to solve a problem does not affect anyone else's ability to use calculus (at the same time)
- Ideas are infinitely reusable
# Ideas and the Production Function
- We now consider knowledge as being produced by inventors/researchers
- Assume that knowledge increases productivity  $A_{t}$
- $A_{t}$  no longer exogenously given. Rather, it is produced.
- Two types of production:
- Production of goods
- Production of knowledge
We need to specify a production function for each of these
# Production of Goods
- Very simple production function for goods:
$$
Y_{t} = A_{t} L_{y t}
$$
- Goods produced with labor and knowledge (ignore capital and land for simplicity)
- Assume good production is constant returns to scale in labor, i.e., constant returns in objects
- If we build a second factory, we can use same knowledge again
- No need to reinvent factory design, etc.
# Returns to Scale
- Since production of goods is constant returns to objects, it is increasing returns to objects + ideas
$$
\begin{array}{l} F (2 K, 2 L, 2 A) = 2 A (2 K)^{1 / 3} (2 L)^{2 / 3} = 2 \cdot 2^{1 / 3} \cdot 2^{2 / 3} \cdot A K^{1 / 3} L^{2 / 3} \\ = 4 \cdot A K^{1 / 3} L^{2 / 3} = 4 \cdot F (K, L, A). \\ \end{array}
$$
- Growth in ideas outside logic of replication argument
- Replication argument: constant returns to objects
- But we have growth in knowledge on top of that
# Production of Ideas
- Production function for ideas
$$
A_{t + 1} - A_{t} = \theta L_{a t} A_{t}
$$
- New ideas are produced with labor and existing ideas
- "Standing on the shoulders of giants" view of knowledge production
- The more knowledge you have access to, the easier it is to create yet more knowledge
# Allocation of Labor
- We assume that household labor supply is  $N_{t}$  where  $N_{t}$  is the size of the population
- But how much of this is devoted to production of goods, and how much to production of ideas?
- Simple short cut:
- A fraction  $\overline{\ell}$  devoted to research
- A fraction  $\left(1 - \overline{\ell}\right)$  devoted to production of goods
- This means we have  $L_{at} = \overline{\ell} N_t$
# Population Growth
- We assume that the population growth at a constant rate
$$
N_{t + 1} - N_{t} = \bar {n} N_{t}
$$
- Dividing through by  $N_{t}$  yields
$$
\frac{N_{t + 1} - N_{t}}{N_{t}} = \bar {n}
$$
$$ g_{N} = \bar {n}
$$
# Romer Model
1. Production of goods:
$$
Y_{t} = A_{t} L_{y t}
$$
2. Production of ideas:
$$
A_{t + 1} - A_{t} = \theta L_{a t} A_{t}
$$
3. Labor supply:
$$
L_{a t} + L_{y t} = N_{t}
$$
4. Allocation of labor:
$$
L_{a t} = \overline {{\ell}} N_{t}
$$
5. Population growth:
$$ g_{N} = \overline {{n}}
$$
# Solving Romer Model
- Notice that  $L_{at} + L_{yt} = N_t$  and  $L_{at} = \overline{\ell} N_t$  imply
$$
L_{y t} = (1 - \overline {{\ell}}) N_{t}
$$
- Combining this with the production function  $Y_{t} = A_{t} L_{y t}$  yields
$$
Y_{t} = A_{t} (1 - \overline {{\ell}}) N_{t} \Rightarrow y_{t} = \frac{Y_{t}}{N_{t}} = (1 - \overline {{\ell}}) A_{t}
$$
- Applying growth rate formulas then yields  $g_{y} = g_{A}$
# Solving Romer Model
- Consider the production function for knowledge:
$$
A_{t + 1} - A_{t} = \theta L_{a t} A_{t} \quad \Rightarrow \quad g_{A} = \frac{A_{t + 1} - A_{t}}{A_{t}} = \theta \overline {{\ell}} N_{t}
$$
- We thus have that
$$ g_{y} = g_{A} = \theta \overline {{\ell}} N_{t}
$$
- This model generates long run growth!
- Long-run growth rate proportional to the size of the population
# Scale Effects I
$$ g_{y} = g_{A} = \theta \overline {{\ell}} N_{t}
$$

As the population grows, output growth should rise

- Kremer (1993):
- In Malthusian model, population proportional to productivity
- Population growth can then be used to measure productivity growth

# Scale Effects II
$$ g_{y} = \theta \overline {{\ell}} N_{t}
$$
- Implies that a doubling of the population should lead to a doubling of output growth
- Actually about research effort
A doubling of research effort should double output growth
This has not happened since 1930

# Weaker Scale Effects
- Scale effects in Romer model way too strong
- Jones (1995) points this out and argues for alternative production function for knowledge
$$
A_{t + 1} - A_{t} = \theta L_{a t} A_{t}^{\phi}
$$
Romer assumes  $\phi = 1$
- Jones (1995) argues  $\phi < 1$
# Jones Model
$$
A_{t + 1} - A_{t} = \theta L_{a t} A_{t}^{\phi} \Rightarrow g_{A} = \frac{A_{t + 1} - A_{t}}{A_{t}} = \theta \overline {{\ell}} N_{t} A_{t}^{\phi - 1}
$$
- Suppose we take growth rates of this last equation
- If  $g_{A}$  is constant, then its growth rate is zero. So, we have:
$$
0 = g_{N} + (\phi - 1) g_{A}
$$
- Rearranging then yields:
$$ g_{y} = g_{A} = \frac{\bar {n}}{1 - \phi}
$$
- Long-run growth in  $y_{t} = Y_{t} / N_{t}$  is proportional to population growth

# Might Growth Speed Up?
- Finding Einstein:
- Traditionally most people have not been able to reach their potential as producers of ideas/knowledge
- Extreme poverty, cast/class restrictions, discrimination
- How many Einstein / Doudnas have we missed
- Perhaps machines can replace labor in knowledge production
- Even if we have less people, we can have more machines producing knowledge
- Automation of ideas could even yield "singularity" (explosive growth)
# Innovation Policy
- What government policies do we have to encourage knowledge production?
- Grant patents to inventors
- Subsidize basic research
- Key questions:
- Why do we need these policies?
(What is the market failure?)
- What are the downsides of these policies?
# Production of a New Drug
- Consider the production of a new drug
- Drug development costs 800 million
- Once invented: Constant returns to scale
- Standard replication argument
- To double production: Build another identical factory
- Once invented: Marginal cost: 10
- How do we bring about efficient use of drug?
# Efficient Use of New Drug
- How do we bring about efficient use of drug?
- Price must equal marginal cost!
- A competitive market would bring this about
What is the problem with this?
– Inventor can’t recoup initial 800 million investment
- Inventor will thus not spend resources inventing
- Conclusion: Policy of placing new knowledge in the "public domain" and relying on competitive markets yields insufficient incentives to create knowledge
What is the market failure?
# Market Failure in Market for Ideas
- If we don’t grant property rights over ideas:
- This is the market failure
- Inventor can’t capture full benefits of his/her efforts and thus has insufficiently strong incentives to engage in research
- Outcome: Too little knowledge production
- If we do grant property rights over ideas:
- Owner becomes a monopolist
- Will price product above marginal cost
- Outcome: Too little use of existing knowledge
# Market Failure in Market for Ideas
- Imagine we could grant property rights in a special way:
- We have a technology that guarantees that no one else can use invention without inventing it from scratch (no backward engineering)
- In other words: Imagine that we can make invention fully excludable
– But everyone else is free to reinvent invention at a cost of 800 million (i.e., not a patent)
- Now what is the market failure?
# Market Failure in Market for Ideas
- Will we get perfect competition?
- No!!
- With perfect competition: price = marginal cost
- Firms can’t recoup initial investment
- Firms will stop entering market before we get to perfect competition.
- We will have an “oligopolistic” market
# Market for Ideas in Practice
- Full exclusability is not realistic
- Backward engineering always possible
- In practice non-excludability a serious issue
- Incentives to invest too low
# Realistic policy options
1. Laissez faire
Insufficient incentives to invest
2. Grant "patents" (temporary monopoly)
Enforces temporary full excludability
- But: Price  $>$  marginal cost
- Inefficiently low use of invention
3. Government subsidies for research
Who decides what to fund?
# Economics of Patents
- Benefit:
- Provide an incentive for knowledge production.
Cost:
- Price = Marginal Benefit > Marginal Cost
— Example: HIV drugs in the late 1990s
- Had been invented. Marginal cost very low.
- Prices much higher than marginal costs
- Many people in poor countries could pay marginal cost but not price. Priced out of the market.
- Huge loss in welfare (Many people died!)
Alternative: Prizes (Michael Kremer, QJE 1998)
# Prizes
- Why not just pay inventors for useful inventions?
- But who would decide how much to pay?
- Perhaps we can get “the market” to decide. (How?)
- Hold an auction:
- Highest bidder gets patent with  $5 \%$ probability
- With  $95 \%$ probability government pays highest bid to inventor and releases knowledge to public domain
# Case Against Patents
- Boldrin and Levine (2013)
- Explosion in number of patents:
- 1983: 59,715, 2003: 189,597, 2010: 244,341
- Scant evidence of increase in productivity
- Anecdotally, many recent patents are trivial
- Perhaps filed to be able to extract fees from others or create a barrier to entry
- First mover advantage perhaps enough of an incentive to innovate
# Defensive Patenting: Smartphones
- Apple and Microsoft large incumbents with huge patent portfolios
- Google a new innovative entrant
- Google purchased Motorola Mobility for patent portfolio
- Main use of patent portfolio arguably to threaten counter-suits if Apple and Microsoft sue
- If all companies have lots of patents and all are successful in the market no one can sue because others can counter-sue
Patents are just an added cost to innovation (and barrier to entry for small poor firms)

# Proximate vs. Fundamental Causes

Research on income differences can arguably be classified into one or more arrows in the following chain of causality:

Geography, Climate, Luck  $\Rightarrow$  Human Capital, Physical Capital, TFP  $\Rightarrow$  Income

$\Downarrow$

Institutions, Culture  $\Rightarrow$  Human Capital, Physical Capital, TFP  $\Rightarrow$  Income

$\Downarrow$

Policies, Rule of Law, Corruption  $\Rightarrow$  Human Capital, Physical Capital, TFP  $\Rightarrow$  Income

# Development Accounting
- Production function for country  $i$ :
$$
Y_{i} = A_{i}^{1 - a} K_{i}^{a} H_{i}^{1 - a}
$$
- Human capital:  $H_{i} = h_{i} L_{i}$
- Human capital per person:  $h_i$  (often proxied by years of schooling)
- Raw labor:  $L_{i}$  (workers or hours of labor)
- Divide by  $Y_{i}^{a}$  and then raise both sides to power  $1 / (1 - a)$ :
$$
Y_{i}^{1 - a} = A_{i}^{1 - a} \left(\frac{K_{i}}{Y_{i}}\right)^{a} H_{i}^{1 - a} \rightarrow Y_{i} = A_{i} \left(\frac{K_{i}}{Y_{i}}\right)^{\frac{a}{1 - a}} H_{i}
$$
# Development Accounting
- Divide through by  $L_{i}$ :
$$ y_{i} = A_{i} \left(\frac{K_{i}}{Y_{i}}\right)^{\frac{a}{1 - a}} h_{i}
$$
- Decomposes output per worker  $y_{i}$  into
- Productivity:  $A_{i}$
- Capital-output ratio:  $K_{i} / Y_{i}$
- Human capital per worker:  $h_{i}$
- Development accounting asks how much of differences in output per worker are due to each of these three factors
# Development Accounting
$$ y_{i} = A_{i} \left(\frac{K_{i}}{Y_{i}}\right)^{\frac{a}{1 - a}} h_{i}
$$
- Penn World Tables dataset gathers data on:
- Output:  $Y_{i}$
- Number of workers:  $L_{i}$
- Capital:  $K_{i}$
- Average level of schooling:  $h_{i}$
- Choose a value for  $a$  (e.g.,  $1 / 3$ )
- We treat  $A_{i}$  as a residual

# Development Accounting
- Difference in output per worker across countries factor of 50
- None of this is due to low capital-output ratio
- Poor countries seem not to be poor because they lack capital
- Factor of 2 due to difference in human capital
- Lack of education plays some role in poor countries being poor
- Factor of 25 due to difference in productivity
- Productivity (“measure of our ignorance”) explains bulk of difference
# Agriculture and Development
- Most people in poor countries work in agriculture
- Classic view of development: Reallocation out of agriculture into “modern” sectors
- But what is holding that back?

# Agriculture and Development: Two Views
1. Unproductive urban sector is the problem
- Urban sector can’t absorb labor
- Urban sector unproductive or can’t grow fast enough
- People in country-side are “army of surplus labor”
2. Unproductive agricultural sector is the problem
- Labor needed to produce food ("food problem")
- Agricultural sector can’t shed labor
Unclear which of these stories is more important
# Agricultural Productivity Gap
- Value added per worker is much lower in agriculture than in other sectors
Why don’t workers leave the agricultural sector?
- Poor countries employ most workers in sector that they are particularly unproductive in
- Deviation from comparative advantage

# Barriers to Riches
# Proximate Causes:
- Not capital
- Education perhaps factor of 2
- Mostly “productivity” (whatever that is)
- Most people in poor countries work in unproductive agriculture
# Fundamental Causes:
- Geography
Trade
- Institutions
- Luck (e.g., leaders)
Culture
- Religion
Etc.
# Simple Regressions
Cross-country regressions of growth on various candidate causes
- But everything else not equal

- Does democracy cause growth?
- Or prosperity cause democracy?
- Omitted variables bias:

# Fundamental Causes of Growth
- Convincing evidence needs to be based on exogenous variation in candidate cause
- Variation not related to any other potential cause
- Very hard to find exogenous variation in fundamental causes – Need to look for “natural experiments”
- Literature includes many creative approaches
Here I present a few examples
# Geography Clearly Exogenous
- Countries closer to the equator are poorer on average
- But why?

# Institutions and Growth
- Long line of thought arguing that good institutions cause high income
- Secure property rights, rule of law, constraints on the executive
- Where do we find exogenous variation in institutions?
- West vs. East Germany (1945-1989)
- South vs. North Korea (post-1953)
- Suggest capitalism is good for growth

# Institutions and Growth
- How can we find other exogenous variation in institutions?
- Institutions often have long term historical roots
- Institutions often have very long-lasting effects
- We consider two examples:
- Long-term effect of Mining Mita in Peru and Bolivia
- Long-term effect of early colonial institutions
# Long Term Effects of Peru's Mining Mita
- Melissa Dell (2010): Peru's mining mita as a natural experiment for outcomes today
- Mita: Forced labor institution in Peru and Bolivia under Spanish colonial rule
In effect from 1573 to 1812
One-seventh of adult male population required to work in Potosi silver mines and Huancavelica mercury mine

FIGURE 1.—The mita boundary is in black and the study boundary in light gray. Districts falling inside the contiguous area formed by the mita boundary contributed to the mita. Elevation is shown in the background.
# Peru's Mining Mita
- Dell asks: What are the effects of mining mita on people living in this region today?
- How can we figure this out?
- Compare people in this region versus rest of Peru and Bolivia?
- But other things may also differ (e.g., altitude, fertility of soil, etc.)
What about looking right around the edges!
# Peru's Mining Mita
- If other factors change "smoothly," then we can compare area right inside catchment zone with area right outside
- Everything else should be approximately constant
- Only thing that differs is “exposure” to mita
Method is called Regression Discontinuity Design (RD or RDD)
# Peru's Mining Mita
- But perhaps catchment boundary is chosen to be at a cliff or some other place where other things change discontinuously
Dell only studies part of catchment boundary
- Makes sure a bunch of other things are similar on both sides

Dell then looks at:
- Household consumption today
- \% of children with stunted growth today
- Compares areas right inside with areas right outside mita zone

The unit of observation is the household in columns 1-3 and the individual in columns 4-7. Robust standard errors, adjusted for clustering by district, are in parentheses. The dependent variable is log equivalent household consumption (ENAHO (2001)) in columns 1-3, and a dummy equal to 1 if the child has stunted growth and equal to 0 otherwise in columns 4-7 (Ministro de Educación (2005a)). Mita is an indicator equal to 1 if the household's district contributed to the mita and equal to 0 otherwise (Saignes (1984), Amaty Juniet (1947, pp. 249, 284)). Panel A includes a cubic polynomial in the latitude and longitude of the observation's district capital, panel B includes a cubic polynomial in Euclidean distance from the observation's district capital to Potosi, and panel C includes a cubic polynomial in Euclidean distance to the nearest point on the mita boundary. All regressions include controls for elevation and slope, as well as boundary segment fixed effects (F.E.s). Columns 1-3 include demographic controls for the number of infants, children, and adults in the household. In columns 1 and 4, the sample includes observations whose district capitals are located within  $100\mathrm{km}$  of the mita boundary, and this threshold is reduced to 75 and  $50\mathrm{km}$  in the succeeding columns. Column 7 includes only observations whose districts border the mita boundary.  $78\%$  of the observations are in mita districts in column 1,  $71\%$  in column 2,  $68\%$  in column 3,  $78\%$  in column 4,  $71\%$  in column 5,  $68\%$  in column 6, and  $58\%$  in column 7. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero are denoted by the following system:  $*10\%, *5\%$ , and  $* * * 1\%$ .

(d) Haciendas (1845)
# Peru's Mining Mita
- Dell argues that long-term effects of mita come through land tenure and public goods
- Haciendas – rural estates with attached labor force – primarily outside mita
- Colonial policy encouraged communal land tenure inside mita
- Security of land rights better outside mita area after mita ended
- Haciendas elite pushed for public goods such as roads
# Colonization as a Natural Experiment
- Starting in  $15^{\text{th}}$  century Europeans conquered much of the rest of the world
- Imposed new institutions
- Imposed different institutions in different places
- Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson (2001, 2002) argue that this can be viewed as a natural experiment to assess the effect of institutions on prosperity
# Reversal of Fortunes
In 1500:
- Mughals in India, Aztecs and Incas in Americas among richest civilizations (outside Europe)
- North-East U.S., New Zealand, Australia much less developed
Today:
- Lands of Mughals, Aztecs and Incas among poorer societies
- U.S., New Zealand, Australia among richest
# Reversal of Fortunes
Systematic phenomenon?
- How to measure income in 1500?
- Urbanization: Only societies with a certain level of development can sustain large urban centers
- Puzzling from perspective of geography story

# Timing of Reversal
- High urbanization regions faced large decline after 1500 (exploitation)
- Low urbanization regions saw gradual rise that took off in  $19^{th}$  century
- Only at time of industrialization did low urbanization regions really take off
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/b8505fd058bbaae28ba9e9fe98076614d513dd2fea55b4086d760b17aabdd374.jpg)

# Institutions and Reversal
- AJR argue that Europeans set up “worse” (more extractive) institutions in regions with higher urbanization
- Institutions very persistent
- This eventually caused reversal of fortunes
- Why did Europeans set up worse institutions in the tropics?
# Why Different Institutions?
1. Where there was wealth to steal it had appeal to set up institutions that facilitated “extracting resources”
Gold, silver, sugar, people to exploit.
Where there was little wealth and few people it made less sense to try to “extract resources”.
# Why Different Institutions?
# 2. Different disease environment
- Europeans have poor immunity against tropical diseases
- High mortality of European settlers in certain areas meant low levels of settlement in those areas
- Where Europeans didn’t settle, they set up worse institutions
- Where they did settle, they set up better institutions
- Institutions persisted
- Disease environment 200 years back affects outcomes today through institutions
# AJR's Theory
(potential) settler mortality  $\Rightarrow$  settlements
$\Rightarrow \begin{array}{c} \text{early} \\ \text{institutions} \end{array} \Rightarrow \begin{array}{c} \text{current} \\ \text{institutions} \end{array}$
$\Rightarrow$  current performance.
# Settler Mortality as an Instrument
- AJR propose to use settler mortality as an instrument for current institutions
- Two conditions must hold for this to be a valid instrument
- Relevance: Settler mortality must be correlated with current institutions. (It is. See next slide)
- Exogeneity: Settler mortality cannot be correlated with any other cause of current prosperity (i.e., it should only affect current prosperity thought current institutions)
- Threat to exogeneity?
# Settler Mortality and Current Institutions
- Settler mortality is correlated with current institutions
- Places with low settler mortality have better current institutions (as measured by protection against risk of expropriation)
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/8a538253769212dbb30bc2ec025b24ebe3bd533f0deb38e9f315013e259213c9.jpg)
Figure 14. Log mortality of potential European settlers and average protection against risk of expropriation 1985-95.
# Settler Mortality and Current Prosperity
- Settler mortality is strongly related to current prosperity
- If exogeneity holds, this correlation is only due to affect on current institutions
In this case, it provides evidence for institutions affecting prosperity
- Effect is very large (can explain bulk of income differences)

# Institutions or Just Luck?
- North vs. South Korea often used as an example of institutions mattering
- But how convincing is this example?
- Perhaps difference is largely luck in the form of leaders of different quality

- South Korea - North Korea
# Did South Korea Have Better Institutions?
Not clear South Korea had better institutions
They were a dictatorship just like North Korea
- But their dictator (Park Chung-hee, 1961-1979) chose different policies than North Korea's (Kim Il Sung, 1948-1994)

# Do Leaders Matter for Growth?
# Differing views:
- Tolstoy: Historical figures mere ex post justifications for events out of any individual's influence
- Marx: "materialist dialectic". Social and economic forces trump individuals
- John Keegan: The political history of the twentieth century can be found in the biographies of six men: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Roosevelt and Churchill.
# Do Leaders Matter for Growth?
- Claim: National leaders cause changes in growth in the countries they govern.
- How can we bring evidence to bear on this causal question?
- Look at whether changes in leaders are systematically associated with changes in growth?
- But leadership transitions are not random
- Leader my be ousted because growth is bad (reverse causality)
# Do Leaders Matter for Growth?
- We need to find a natural experiment
- Are there any leadership transitions that are random from the perspective of growth?
- Jones and Olken (2005):
- Look at leadership transitions due to death of leaders while in office
- Deaths from natural causes and accidents (exclude assassinations)
- In these cases, the timing of the transition is random

b. There are 1294 distinct terms in which leaders are in power in the data set, but only 1184 counted in this table, as we do not witness the exit of leaders who are still in power at the end of the year 2000.
c. There are 77 cases of leaders who die in office by natural causes or accidents, but only 57 who die during periods where there are available growth data before and after the leader's death.
# How Do We Measure Effect?
- For deaths of leaders: Calculate difference in growth in  $T$  years before death and  $T$  years after death
- They want to know if this change is unusual
- So, they calculate same statistic for all years (i.e., change in growth  $T$  years before and after year  $t$ )
- Ask: Is change when leaders die unusually large?
# A Few Dramatic Examples
China: Mao (Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution)
- Mozambique: Samora Machel (Communist, nationalized all private land, Portuguese fled)
- Guinea: Sekou Toure (totalitarian violent purges)
- Iran: Ayatollah Khomeini (opposed peace in Iran-Iraq war)

- Variance of Post – Pre is  $31 \%$ higher for leader death years than for other years.
- Difference is statistically significant
- With a few more assumption:
- A one standard deviation increase in leader quality increases growth rate by  $1.5\%$  per year
- Effect only exists for autocratic regimes. Not for democracies. Larger for countries with fewer constraints on executive power
# Lecture 10: Money, Inflation, and Output
Macroeconomics (Quantitative)
Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Monetary Economics
- The role of money in the economy is one of the most mysterious aspects of economics
- Key questions:
- What gives money value?
- Why does its value change over time?
- How and why does monetary policy affect output and employment?
Keynesian economics / financial crises
- But we start with a parable
# Great Babysitting Co-op Crisis
- Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-op
- 150 couples
- Exchange babysitting services
- Use coupons ("scrip") to keep track of things
- Coupons are the "money" in the babysitting economy
- Each coupon pays for  $\frac{1}{2}$  hour of baby sitting
- "Constitutionally fixed" price
# "Money" in the Babysitting Economy
- Early on:
- Couples got 20 coupons upon entry
- Must give back 20 coupons upon exit
- Everything worked well for a while
- But … quantity of coupons fell over time:
- Some coupons lost in washing machine
- Dues exceeded expenses
- Each couple had less and less coupons
# Crisis in Babsitting Economy
- Each couple felt it didn't have enough coupons and started to try to acquire more
- Everyone wanted to sit, but no one wanted to go out
- Does this work in the aggregate?
- No! For someone to sit, someone else must go out.
- So, the baby-sitting economy fell into recession. There was a fall in GBP (Gross Babysitting Product)
- Lots of workers wanted to work but no one wanted buy what they produced
# Crisis in the Babysitting Economy
- Being a bunch of lawyers, they:
- Passed a bylaw: Everyone must go out at least every six months.
- Didn't work
- Finally, they resorted to monetary policy:
- Everyone got 10 additional pieces of scrip
- Each new couple gets 30 upon entering
- Must give back 20 upon leaving
- Miraculously: Gross Babysitting Product boomed!!
# New Problem in Babysitting Economy

Balance of money supply:

- New system implied that turnover of couples increased "money supply"
- Dues and natural loss decreases money supply
- If there is "too much" turnover, couples will have more coupons than they need
- How do they react to this?
- Everyone wants to go out.
- No one wants to sit
- Goods shortages
# Lessons from the Babysitting Economy
- Too little money: Recession (too little demand)
- Too much money: Shortages (too much demand)
Goldilocks economy:
- Just the right amount of money
- Balance between desire to produce and desire to consume
What is the market failure?
# What is Money?
- Lay English: "That person has a lot of money"
- "That person is wealthy"
In Economics:
- "Money" has more specific meaning
- Roughly: The asset that people use as a medium of exchange (whatever they use to make payment) and unit of account (post prices and wages in terms of)
# Many Things Have Been Used As Money

Cowrie shells, cattle, tobacco, beaver skins, etc.

- Island Yap: Large Stone wheels
- Iceland in Viking times:
- Word for money same as word for sheep: "fé"
- Money in viking times:
- 1 cow = 6 sheep (with wool and young)
- 1 sheep = 20 "forearms" of woven wool
- 1 "forearm" of woven wool = 2 fish
- Precious metals: Gold, silver, bronze, etc.
- Prisons: Cigarettes
- Pieces of green paper with picture of George Washington
# Traditional Functions of Money
1. Medium of Exchange
- People can pay for things they purchase using money
2. Unit of Account
- People generally quote prices and wages in terms of units of money (e.g., in dollar in the U.S. today)
3. Store of Value
- People may hold money so as to be able to buy something tomorrow or later
# Money in the U.S. Today
- Unit of Account:
- Prices and wages are posted in "US dollars"
- US dollar is clearly the unit of account in the US
Medium of Exchange:
- Complicated! Coins and bills not only medium of exchange
- Debit cards, checks, credit cards, Venmo, Paypal, etc.
- In most cases a bank deposit is real medium of exchange
- Store of value:
- Coins and bills not important store of value (don't pay interest)
- Many other better stores of value (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.)
# The Purpose of Money
- Money is a device to lower transactions costs
- Instructive to start by thinking about money in a "primitive" society (i.e., one that involves little trade and specialization) – Helps us think about basic properties of monetary economics
- We will then add more and more "modern" elements until we arrive at a fully modern setting
# Society of Yeomen Farmers
- Each household is self-sufficient in everything
- Produce everything they consume
- Make their own food, clothing, shelter, etc.
- No trade
What is the role of money in such a society?
- Money has no role!
- If there is no trade, no need for money
- Money is a device for lowering transactions costs
# Society of Yeomen Farmers
- At some point someone realizes they are particularly good at making, say, shoes
- Specializes in making shoes
- Sells shoes to others in exchange for other things
Over time, more and more people specialize
- Important question arises:
- How will trade work?
# Specialization and Trade
- Baker makes bread, Shoemaker makes shoes, Janitor cleans, Teacher teaches, etc.
- How does trade work?
- Barter trade: Baker and shoemaker exchange bread for shoes
- Problem: If teacher wants bread but baker doesn't want a math lesson, no scope for trade.
- Lack of double coincidence of wants
What needs to happen?
# Something Becomes Money
- Shoemaker may take bread as payment for shoes even if she doesn't want bread (Why?)
- Bread may thus become "money"
- Bread not ideal money (Why?)
- Baker can solve this problem by issuing bread tokens – Pieces of paper that entitle bearer to one loaf of bread
- Bread tokens circulate and become medium of exchange, i.e., become money
# Bread Tokens as Money

What are potential problems with this?

- Counterfeiting!
(Huge problem through the ages)
- Baker may issue "too many" tokens
(issuing tokens likely to be highly profitable)
- Baker may "default" on tokens
(i.e., not be able to deliver loaves of break on demand)
- If people doubt baker's ability to deliver, the may rush to convert tokens into bread (i.e., run on the baker (financial crisis))
- Value of tokens depends on people's confidence in baker
# What Characteristics Should Money Have?
1. Durable
2. Easily measured
3. Easily transferable
4. Easily divisible
5. Have stable value
The point of "money" is to lower transaction costs
# Stable Quantity of Money
- Many people think that stable quantity is a desirable characteristic for money
-E.g., Satoshi Nakamoto (creator of bitcoin)
- Not clear that this is true
- Stable value is what we are really after!
- If demand for money fluctuates, while quantity is fixed, then price of money will fluctuate (e.g., bitcoin)
- This will mean value is not stable
# Why Gold and Silver?

Gold and Silver were dominant forms of money for many centuries. Why?

1. They are durable
2. Easily measured (Especially after advent of coinage)
3. Easily transferable (high value relative to volume and weight)
4. Stable value?
# Our First Monetary / Business Cycle Model
- Goal: Understand influence of money on output and inflation
- Complicated subject. We do this in steps.
- First model: Medieval Economy
- Contains certain central ideas in simple form
- Leaves out many aspects of reality
- We will add these one-by-one over the next few weeks
# Money and Transactions
- Only medium of exchange: gold coins
- All payments made with gold coins
- Gold is only asset people accept as payment in transactions
- In every transaction, gold coins much change hands
- People hold money to be able to engage in transactions – Just like scrip in babysitting economy
- Transactions based demand for gold coins
# Demand for Money
- People's demand for money (gold coins) is proportional to the nominal value of output:
$$
M_{t} = k P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- $Y_{t}$  is real value of output
- $P_{t}$  is the price level
- $k$  is a (constant) parameter
- $P_{t} Y_{t}$  is the nominal value of output
# Demand for Money
$$
M_{t} = k P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Our money demand curve is motivated by the following ideas:
- Amount of money people hold is increasing in nominal value of transactions they engage in
- Nominal value of transactions is increasing in the nominal value of output
- But these are rather loose notions
(ours is a simple model)
# Quantity Equation
- Define:  $V = \frac{1}{k}$
We can rewrite the money market equilibrium:
$$
M_{t} = k P_{t} Y_{t} \Rightarrow M_{t} V = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Velocity of money:
- "Number of times each gold coin must change hands per year" (catchy but overly simplistic idea)
This is called the "Quantity Equation"
# What Determines Velocity?
$$
M_{t} V = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Initially we assume velocity is constant
- More generally velocity determined by:
- Transaction technology (ATMs, checks, credit cards)
- Uncertainty about future transactions
Opportunity cost of holding money (interest rate)
- Gold coins don't not pay interest
- In our middle ages economy: Say people try to maintain a months worth of expenses in gold coins
# Supply of Money
- Money supply in medieval economy is simply the stock of gold coins in the country
- Exogenously given:  $M_{t}$  is exogenous
- Most of the time,  $M_{t}$  doesn't change
- Economy is on an island and doesn't trade with other countries
- Country has no gold mines
# Two Perspectives
$$
M_{t} V = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
1. Household perspective:
- $M_{t}$  is a choice. Each household chooses how much money to hold as a function of nominal value of output
- Money demand
2. Economy-wide perspective:
- Total  $M_{t}$  in the economy is given!
Collectively, households must end up holding the number of gold coins that actually exist in economy
- Quantity equation helps determine  $P_{t}$  and  $Y_{t}$
Money market equilibrium
# Production in the Medieval Economy
- Suppose every household owns a small business:
- Pub, bakery, potato farm, shoe shop, etc.
- Production function:
$$
Y_{t} = A L_{t}
$$
- Constant returns to scale
- For simplicity, labor is only a factor of production
- $A$  is exogenous
# Labor Supply in the Middle Ages
- Businesses post a price at the beginning of each period (before they observe demand)
- They then service all customers that demand their goods – If demand is high, they have to work more
These are key assumptions of Keynesian models (prices set in advance and firms meet demand)
- implies that output is determined by demand in the short run
# Demand Management in Middle Ages
- Desired labor supply:  $L^{*}$
- Amount they want to work
- But they will work more if demand is high and less if demand is low
- Suppose demand is high in a particular period and shopkeepers find themselves working more than they want.
What do they do about this?
# Price Adjustment in the Middle Ages
- At the end of the period they take stock and think about whether they should change their price
- They are not sure why demand was high
- Maybe just some temporary thing
- Maybe a permanent thing
- If demand is temporary they don't want to change prices. But if it is permanent they should change their price
# Price Adjustment in the Middle Ages

They decide to adjust prices a bit:

- Demand "too" high => raise prices somewhat
- Demand "too" low => lower prices somewhat
$$
\frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{L_{t}}{L^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
- $\theta$  captures speed of price adjustment
# Reasons for Stickiness of Prices

In reality, prices are "sticky" for many reasons:

- Imperfect attention: Firms have other things to worry about than the money supply
- Costs of changing prices ("menu costs")
- Fear of antagonizing customers
- Worry that competitors will not change price (coordination problem)
# Price Rigidity Evidence

# Model of Medieval Economy
Money Market Equilibrium:
$$
M_{t} V = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Production:
$$
Y_{t} = A L_{t}
$$
- Price Adjustment:
$$
\frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{L_{t}}{L^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
# Simplifying the Model
- Let's get rid of  $L_{t}$  to simplify the model
- Desired level of production:
$$
Y^{*} = A L^{*}
$$
- Use production function (and desired version) to eliminate  $L_{t}$  and  $L^{*}$  from price adjustment equation:
$$
\frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$

# Vikings Bring Back Gold Plunder
- Say our medieval economy sends off a ship of vikings to plunder gold from unsuspecting monasteries in a neighboring country
- Vikings bring back shipload of gold coins
What happens to the economy?
- What happens in the very short run?
- What happens over time?
- What is the result of this in the long run?
# Vikings Bring Back Gold Plunder
- At first: Vikings go on a spending spree
- Gold coins slowly diffuse through the economy
- Everyone has more gold coins than before
- People have more gold coins than they want
- So, what do they do?
- Try to spend them. Boom time!!
- On aggregate this doesn’t help
- If one person spends someone else gets a gold coin
- “Too much money chasing too few goods”
# Boom Time in the Middle Ages
- Producers face increased demand for their goods – How do they respond to this?
- Prices start to rise
- How much do prices rise?
- How does this affect the boom in output?
- Not clear
- Helpful to use our formal model
# Steady State Before Viking Voyage
- Suppose  $M_{t} = M$  and has been for a long time
- Steady state: Nothing changing over time
$$
\frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y^{*}}\right)^{\theta} \mathrm{be co me s} 1 = \left(\frac{Y}{Y^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
- Steady state output:
$$
Y = Y^{*}
$$
Equal to desired level of output
# Steady State Before Viking Voyage
- Steady state output  $Y = Y^{*}$
What about steady state price level?
$$
M V = P Y^{*} \rightarrow P = \frac{M V}{Y^{*}}
$$
- Notice that we have solved for  $Y$  and  $P$  as a function of exogenous variables
# Viking Voyage Raises Money Supply
- Economy is knocked out of steady state by the “shock” of having more gold coins (bigger money supply):  $\widetilde{M} > M$
- Eventually gravitates to a new steady state
- Same math as before yields:
$$
\widetilde {Y} = Y^{*} \quad \mathrm{an d} \quad \widetilde {P} = \frac{\widetilde {M} V}{Y^{*}}
$$
- Difference in price level in steady states:
$$
\frac{\tilde {P}}{P} = \frac{\tilde {M}}{M}
$$
# Long-Run Change in Prices
$$
\frac{\tilde {P}}{P} = \frac{\tilde {M}}{M} \qquad \tilde {Y} = Y = Y^{*}
$$
In the long run:
- Prices rise proportionately with the money supply
- Output is unaffected by changes in the money supply
Classical Dichotomy: Change in the money supply leaves output unchanged in the long run
- Also called Long Run Monetary Neutrality
# Long Run Monetary Neutrality
- If the money supply doubles, in the long run:
- Prices will double
- Output unaffected
- Why?: Only relative prices matter
- Labor supply is a function of "real wage", i.e., how much stuff you get for working an extra hour
- Investment is a function of “real interest rate”, i.e. how much extra stuff you get for lending money
- Nominal variables are determined by money supply
# What About the Short Run?
- For dynamics, convenient to take logs:
$$
M_{t} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t} \quad \mathrm{an d} \quad \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$ become
$$
\ln M_{t} + \ln \bar {V} = \ln P_{t} + \ln Y_{t}
$$
$$
\ln P_{t + 1} - \ln P_{t} = \theta (\ln Y_{t} - \ln Y^{*})
$$
- Notice that model is linear in logs
# Quantity Equation in Changes
- Useful to write quantity equation in changes
$$
\ln M_{t} + \ln V = \ln P_{t} + \ln Y_{t}
$$
$$
\ln M_{t} - \ln M_{t - 1} + \ln V - \ln V = \ln P_{t} - \ln P_{t - 1} + \ln Y_{t} - \ln Y_{t - 1}
$$
$$
\Delta \ln M_{t} = \Delta \ln P_{t} + \Delta \ln Y_{t}
$$
$$
- \text{Wh er e} \Delta \ln M_{t} = \ln M_{t} - \ln M_{t - 1}
$$
- Notice that  $\ln V - \ln V = 0$
# Day Before Arrival of Gold
- Suppose Vikings arrive at  $t = 0$ .
- In period  $t = -1$ , economy is in old steady state:
$$
\ln Y_{- 1} = \ln Y^{*}
$$
$$
\ln P_{- 1} = \ln M + \ln V - \ln Y^{*}
$$
Evening before Viking arrive:
- Producers set prices for next day:
$$
\ln P_{0} - \ln P_{- 1} = \theta (\ln Y_{- 1} - \ln Y^{*})
$$
$$
\ln P_{0} = \ln P_{- 1}
$$
- i.e., no change in prices (nothing has happened yet)
# Day Gold Arrives
$$
\Delta \ln M_{0} = \Delta \ln P_{0} + \Delta \ln Y_{0}
$$
- But we know from before that
$$
\Delta \ln P_{0} = \ln P_{0} - \ln P_{- 1} = 0
$$
(Producers didn’t change their prices for that day)
So, we have that:
$$
\Delta \ln M_{0} = \Delta \ln Y_{0}
$$
- Initially, output increases as much as the money supply
# Day Gold Arrives
- Recall that
$$
\Delta \ln M_{t} \cong \frac{M_{t} - M_{t - 1}}{M_{t - 1}}
$$
- i.e., log change is approximately equal to percentage change (for small changes)
- So, percentage change in output is the same as for money supply initially
- If money supply increases by  $5 \%$ , then initially output will increase by  $5 \%$
# Evening of Day Gold Arrives
- Producers take stock of the day:
- Demand was higher than they expected
- They had to work more than they expected/wanted
$$
Y_{0} > Y^{*} \quad (L_{0} > L^{*})
$$
- Producers are not sure why:
- Perhaps a temporary thing
— Perhaps Vikings brought back more gold
- Producers decide to adjust partially:
$$
\ln P_{1} - \ln P_{0} = \theta (\ln Y_{0} - \ln Y^{*})
$$
# Next Day
- Prices higher than before:
$$
\begin{array}{l} \ln P_{1} - \ln P_{0} = \theta (\ln Y_{0} - \ln Y^{*}) \\ = \theta \Delta \ln M_{0} \\ \end{array}
$$
Now use money market equation to solve for output at  $t = 1$ :
$$
\Delta \ln M_{1} = \Delta \ln P_{1} + \Delta \ln Y_{1}
$$
$$
\Delta \ln Y_{1} = - \theta \Delta \ln M_{0}
$$
$$
\left(\Delta \ln M_{1} = 0 \text{si nc en om or eg ol da rr iv es on da y1}\right)
$$
# Next Day
$$
\Delta \ln Y_{1} = - \theta \Delta \ln M_{0}
$$
- Since prices rise, output starts falling back to normal level
- This was the intention of the price setters
- But output is still above  $Y^{*}$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \ln Y_{1} - \ln Y^{*} = \Delta \ln Y_{1} + \Delta \ln Y_{0} \\ = - \theta \Delta \ln M_{0} + \Delta \ln M_{0} \\ = (1 - \theta) \ln M_{0} \\ \end{array}
$$
- Producers again want to raise their prices
# Dynamics over Time
- We can use equations:
$$
\ln M_{t} + \ln \bar {V} = \ln P_{t} + \ln Y_{t}
$$
$$
\ln P_{t + 1} - \ln P_{t} = \theta (\ln Y_{t} - \ln Y^{*})
$$ to trace out dynamics over time

# Response to Monetary Shock in Medieval Economy
- Short run:
- High demand takes businesses by surprise
- Output increases
- Prices respond sluggishly
- Long run:
- Prices respond proportionately:  $\% \Delta P = \% \Delta M$
- Output unaffected
- "Money is neutral in the long run"
# Did the Gold Plunder Make People Better Off?
In the short run?
- Boom in output
- But they had to work more to create the output
- Actually, they worked more than they wanted
- In the long run?
- Output the same as before
- Prices higher
- Striking gold is good for the individual but perhaps not for society as a whole.
# Change in the Supply of Gold Coins
Neoclassical Economics:
- All prices rise immediately (by same fraction as money supply)
- Output unchanged
- Money “neutral” (no effect on output)
Keynesian Economics:
- Prices slow to react
- Output responds to monetary shocks
- Recessions and booms can be caused and alleviated by monetary policy
# Three Historical Episodes
1. The Price Revolution
2. The Big Problem of Small Change
3. The Crime of 1873
# Does Gold have Stable Value?
- Gold and silver were used as money for many centuries in large parts of the world
Today most countries operate fiat currencies
- i.e., currencies not backed by anything
- Many people say we should return to the gold standard today!
- Argue that this will yield a currency with more stable value
- Key question: Did gold and silver have stable value?

# Popular Culprits for Inflation
- During Price Revolution, many believe inflation is due to:
- Middlemen, speculators, and monopoly profits
- Such discussion often fails to understand difference between one particular price being high and the overall price level being high
- Monopoly power leads to a high relative price of a particular product, not a high overall price level

# The Big Problem of Small Change
- Important challenge:
- How to maintain coins of different value in circulation simultaneously
Silver coins:
- (Reasonably) good for smaller transactions
— Bulky for merchant trade
- Gold coins:
- Way too valuable for everyday transactions
- Good for merchant trade
# Bimetallism
- Bimetallism is a monetary system based on a combination of silver and gold coins
- Benefit: Coins with a wide range of value
- Drawback: Difficult to maintain silver and gold coins in circulation simultaneously
- Why difficult?
# Difficulties with Bimetallism
- Two reasons why it was difficult to maintain gold and silver coins in circulation simultaneously:
- The relative price of silver vs. gold changed over time
— Silver coins were clipped and got worn (silver content fell)
- Suppose market price of gold for silver is 13 (i.e., 13g of silver buy 1g of gold)
- If silver and gold coins are minted with this weight ratio, both will circulate
# Undervalued Coins
- Suppose market price of gold rises to 14-to-1 vs. silver
- Gold becomes "undervalued" at the Mint
- You get 13 pennies per gram of gold at the Mint
- You get 14 pennies worth of silver per gram of gold on the market!
- Consequence:
- No one brings gold to the Mint
– Gold coins start being exported / melted down
- Eventually no more gold coins!
# Undervalued Coins
- Another problem:
- Silver coins are clipped or get worn
Silver coins no longer 1g. Rather (say)  $0.8\mathrm{g}$
- Consequences:
- Profitable to create counterfeit "worn" coins (i.e., 0.8g coins)
- Value of coins falls to reflect lower weight
- But then market price of silver in pence rises above price at the mint
- New silver coins become undervalued at the Mint
- Eventually sovereign decides to debase
# Big Problem of Small Change
- Huge problem for hundreds of years
- One example: In 1717 Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint, overvalued gold coins (undervalued silver coins)
- Consequence: Chronic shortage of small change (silver coins) in Britain throughout  $18^{\text{th}}$  century
# Big Problem of Small Change
- Solution: Adopt token coins
- i.e., coins worth more than their metallic content
- Britain did this first in 1816 (U.S. in 1853, France in 1865)
Why not earlier?
- Widespread metallist fallacy
- Needed high quality coins to avoid counterfeiting
- Needed government to guarantee value of coins
# Money in America
U.S. on a bimetallic standard from 1792 until Civil War
- Until 1834: Gold-silver ratio at U.S. Mint 15-1 (gold undervalued)
- After 1834: Gold-silver ratio at U.S. Mint 16-1 (silver undervalued)
- Free coinage: U.S. Mint stands ready to convert all specie (gold and silver) individuals bring to the mint into legal-tender coins

Figure 5: Gold-Silver Price Ratio, 1690-1870
# The Civil War
- Enormous government spending on the war
- How to finance this spending?
U.S. introduced government paper money: "Greenbacks"
- Paid soldiers and paid for war materials with greenbacks
- Greenbacks had no gold or silver backing
- No explicit promise of redemption in specie

Figure 6: An Estimate of the Consumer Price Index in the U.S., 1825-1914
# Back to a Gold Standard
- Wartime inflation doubled price level (in Greenbacks)
- After war: Widespread desire to return to a commodity standard ("sound money")
- Many people think:
- We went off the gold standard and we had a lot of inflation. So, being off gold standard causes inflation.
- Is this a sound argument?
# Back to Gold Standard
- Resumption Act of 1875:
- Full convertibility of paper money into gold and vice-versa (at pre-war rate)
- Should take place Jan 1, 1879
- Many other countries adopted gold at similar time
- Britain (de facto 1717)
- France (1865), Germany (1873)
1870s1914: International Gold Standard
# U.S. Experience on the Gold Standard
U.S. goes back on the gold standard in 1879
- Does this yield price stability
- Actually, huge deflation!
Why?
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/401ba55f22f9bea1a2b8788bcc1b20a5ec35460845283f655a1f702d740a457c.jpg)
Figure 8: An Estimate of the Consumer Price Index in the U.S. and Britain, 1870-1914
# U.S. Experience with Gold Standard
# • Two reasons:
1. Started off with a price level that was high because of war time inflation (i.e., doubt about value of Greenbacks). Resumption raise value of Greenbacks.
2. Period of high economic growth. Production of gold didn’t keep up with increase in demand for gold
$$
\Delta \log P_{t} = \Delta \log M_{t} - \Delta \log Y_{t}
$$
# Politics of U.S. Gold Standard
- Persistent deflation. Largely unanticipated.
- How did this matter?
Who gains and looses?
- “Crime” of 1873: – Demonetization of silver
- Value of silver fell dramatically in 1880s
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/b606dfa858fb72b5894eae72d0bc673fe581f445e2542315b17948af15627872.jpg)
Figure 7: Gold-Silver Price Ratio, 1800-1914
# Crime of 1873
What difference did this make?
U.S. likely would have switched to a silver standard if not for “crime” of 1873
- This would have reduced/eliminated deflation
- Perhaps even lead to substantial inflation
- Although this is not clear since U.S. being on silver standard would have changes demand for silver and raised its price relative to what happened
# Politics of U.S. Gold Standard
- Deflation implied that monetary policy was the major election issue in the presidential election of 1896
William Jennings Bryan:
"You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold"
Bryan lost. Lost by bigger margin in 1900.
- Movement petered out
What solved the "problem"?
# From Deflation to Inflation
1. Large discoveries of gold in South Africa
2. Invention of cyanide process for extracting gold from low-grade ore
William Jennings Bryan's presidential hopes were undone by Scottish chemists and S. African miners

# Lesson About Gold Standard
- Under the gold standard, inflation is dictated by world production of gold (supply of gold) relative growth in world economy (demand for gold as money) and other demand for gold
$$
\Delta \log P_{t} = \Delta \log M_{t} - \Delta \log Y_{t}
$$
- This will not necessarily result in price stability
- Not clear why we want supply of gold to dictate inflation
# Lecture 11:
# Money and Banking
Macroeconomics (Quantitative)
Econ 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Credit as Money
- Early monetary systems used coins, cattle, cowrie shells, etc. as money
- Past millennium saw a shift to the use of credit as money
- Today, most forms of money are a credit instrument – i.e., someone's liability (usually a bank's liability)
- Card payments:
- You are paying with bank deposits
- Funds transferred from your bank account to merchant's bank account
- Bank notes are a bank liability
Even coins are a bank liability today
# Banks and the Modern Payment System
- Banks are a crucial part of modern monetary system
- Virtually all money is a bank liability today
- When we pay for things, we do this with bank liabilities
- Card systems (retail/internet)
- Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) (Payroll/utility bills/mortgage payments)
- Checks
- Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, PayPal, etc. (Pix in Brazil, UPI in India)
- Large-value payment systems: Fedwire ("wire transfers"), CHIPS
- Let's look at how a typical payment works
# How Modern Payments Work

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/0e9701855a513af7d263f827d97445c49a93387d662b548f85e0b6cb1c9335e7.jpg)

Figure 1: Clearing and Settlement of ACH Credit Payment

# Evolution of Payments
- How did our modern payment system come to be?
- Took hundreds of years of innovation
- Bills of exchange used by merchants to avoid shipping coins between cities
- Bank of Amsterdam was first "modern" high value payment system
- Paper money developed in China and Europe
These are discussed in sections 3-5 of textbook chapter (we skip)
# Defining the Money Supply
- In an economy with only coins: Sum of the value of coins
- In an modern economy: Less is obvious
- Conceptually we want money supply to be:
- Value of assets that are used as a medium of exchange
- Checking accounts primary medium of exchange today
- But what about savings accounts and money market accounts?
- Not directly used, but easy to transfer. Should they count?
# Defining the Money Supply
- Money supply: Sum of bank notes and deposits in the hands of the public
- Ignore distinction between checking and savings accounts
- Roughly current definition of M1
- "In the hands of the public":
- Bank notes in bank vaults don't count
- Suppose you deposit 100 in bank (money supply doesn't change)
- Deposits of banks at other banks don't count
# Monetary Base
- Deposits are promises to pay something
- That something is the monetary base
- Completely different concept than money supply
- Monetary base today: Currency and bank reserves
Held by public and by banks
- Monetary base in  $17^{\text{th}} - 19^{\text{th}}$  century: gold and silver specie
Held by public and by banks
- Sometimes also called "high-powered" money or "outside" money
# Banks and the Money Supply
- Banks create money when they make loans

Figure 11: Reserve Ratio of Banks in the United States
# Fractional Reserve Banking
Typical bank around 1900 had a reserve ratio of about  $10\%$
- Banks create a lot of money!!
- This means that they multiply the monetary base
<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury bills</td><td>$1,000</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Currency</td><td>\$1,000</td><td>Net worth</td><td>\$1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Loan</td><td>9,000</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>
Figure 12: Balance Sheet of a Typical Bank
# Money Multiplier
- Money supply:
$$
M = C + D
$$
- M: Money supply
C: Currency
- $D$ : Deposits
- Monetary base:
$$
M_{b} = C + R
$$
- $M_{b}$ : Monetary base
C: Currency
- $R$ : Reserves
$$
\frac{M}{M_{b}} = \frac{C + D}{C + R}
$$
$$
\frac{M}{M_{b}} = \frac{C / D + 1}{C / D + R / D}
$$
$$
M = \frac{C / D + 1}{C / D + R / D} M_{b} = B_{m} M_{b}
$$
# Money Multiplier
$$
M = \frac{C / D + 1}{C / D + R / D} M_{b} = B_{m} M_{b}
$$
- $B_{m}$  is the money multiplier
- Starting with  $M_{b}$ , banking system multiplies money supply by  $B_{m}$  through fractional reserve lending
- $B_{m}$  is a function of two ratios:
- $C / D$ : Currency-to-Deposit ratio
- $R / D$ : Reserve-to-Deposit ratio

Figure 12: Balance Sheet of a Typical Bank
Typical bank around 1900 had a reserve ratio of about  $10\%$
- This bank is leveraged 11 to 1
- Leverage: Assets over net worth
- Suppose the assets of this bank fell in value by  $1\%$ . How much would its net worth fall?
# Bank Leverage and Risk
- Leverage is intimately connected to risk
- Suppose value of bank assets falls by  $1\%$
- 2018
- Net worth falls by  $11\%$
- The more leveraged, the more sensitive net worth is to percent losses on assets

Figure 13: Balance Sheet After a Loss of  $1\%$  of Assets
- Leverage ratio of Goldman Sachs in 2008 was about 26
# Bank Maturity Mismatch
- All banks – even the best capitalized – are fragile
- Basic reason:
- Short-term liabilities (deposits)
- Long-term assets (loans)
- Why this maturity mismatch?
- Banks’ most important roles:
1. Assist costumers in making payments (calls for demand deposits)
2. Finance investments (issue long-term loans)
- Banks create vast amounts of liquidity
- Transform illiquid loans into liquid deposits
# Bank Fragility
- Bank maturity transformation very valuable
- But it also makes banks fragile
- If depositors lose confidence in bank and want money back, bank can get in trouble fast (assets illiquid)
- Depositors know this and may be scared it could happen
- Loss of confidence can be self-fulfilling prophesy
- To understand this better, we need a little bit of game theory
# Prisoner's Dilemma
- Police have arrested two people, but have insufficient evidence unless at least one confesses
- Prisoners held in separate cells and cannot communicate
- Police explain to each one:
- If you confess, they don’t: You go free, they get 10 years
- If they confess, you don’t: You get 10 years, they go free
- If both confess: Both get 5 years
- If neither confess: Both get 1 year
- Prisoners know that they face the same choice
# Prisoner 2

Figure 15: The Prisoner's Dilemma Game
# Prisoner's Dilemma Game
- Nash Equilibrium: Each player plays a “best response” given what other players play
- Prisoner's dilemma game has a single Nash Equilibrium
- Confess, Confess
- But (Confess, Confess) is much worse outcome than (Don’t confers, Don’t confess)
- Mutual cooperation would benefit both, but is not in their individual self interest
# Diamond Dybvig Model of Bank Runs
- Bank takes deposits from many depositors
- Uses funds to finance projects that take two periods to complete
- Projects earn a return of  $R_{l}$  on average
- Depositors need to be able to make payments every period
- Deposits are completely liquid. Can be withdrawn after one period
- Banks compete for depositors by offering return of  $R_{d}$  over two periods
- $R_{l}$  a little larger than  $R_{d}$  so bank can cover other costs
# Diamond Dybvig Model of Bank Runs
- Heart of the model: What happens in period one
- Bulk of bank assets illiquid (lent for two periods)
- Depositors must decide whether to withdraw or not
- Suppose a single depositor gets cold feet and withdraws
- Bank survives (has enough reserves)
- Depositor encores some cost from finding new bank (or mattress)
- Denote this cost by  $\epsilon$ . So, depositor return is  $R_{d} - \epsilon$
- Suppose most depositors get cold feet and withdraw
- Bank fails (not enough reserves)
- Some depositors who run get money back, others don’t. On average  $r$
- Depositors who don’t run get nothing
# Everyone Else
# Withdraw Don't Withdraw
<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Sylvie</td><td>Withdraw</td><td>r</td><td>Rd-ε</td></tr><tr><td>Don’t Withdraw</td><td>0</td><td>Rd</td></tr></table>
Figure 16: The Diamond Dybvig Game
# Diamond Dybvig Model of Bank Runs
- Two (symmetric) Nash equilibria:
- If everyone else runs, Sylvia should run
- If no one else runs, Sylvia should not run
- Fear of run can become self-fulfilling
- If you believe everyone else will run, your best response is to run
- It is only because you think others are going to run that you decide to run
# Banking Panics
- Bank runs can trigger generalized panics
Panics in history:
- England: 1672, 1763, 1772, 1793, 1796, 1811, 1825, 1847, 1857, 1866
U.S.: 1814, 1833, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1930-33
- Panics contribute to deep recessions
- Among most severe economic calamities in capitalist economies
- Preventing panics one of most important public policy problems
# Suspension of Convertibility
- Bank can close its doors to depositors seeking withdrawal
- Milder versions: count slowly, restrict amount
- Widespread suspensions in U.S. in 1893, 1907, 1933
- Buys time to:
- Raise funds
- Convince the public bank is sound
- Allow panic to subside
- Creates a dual monetary system: currency vs. deposits
- Deposits trade at a time varying discount
- Payment difficulties (e.g., firms making payroll)
# Lender of Last Resort
- A central bank with unlimited resources can stop a banking panic by acting as a lender of last resort
- Suppose central bank commits to lend enough to bank that it can withstand any amount of depositor withdrawals
- This eliminates the run equilibrium
- No longer optimal for Sylvie to run even if others run
- Bank will not fail even if others run
- Mere announcement (if credible) can prevent runs from happening
- Bagehot's principles (1873): In a crisis …
1. Lend freely, 2. At a penalty rate, 3. Against good collateral
# Moral Hazard and Last Resort Lending
- Banks will act less prudently if they know central bank will help them out in a crisis
- This is called moral hazard
- Moral hazard is a side effect of insurance
- Central bank is providing banks with insurance against runs
- Some argue:
- Last resort lending is bad policy because it makes for more crises
- If government commits not to bail out banks, they will not get in trouble
- But is such a commitment credible?
# Penalty Rate and Good Collateral
- Bagehot's principles (1873): In a crisis …
1. Lend freely, 2. At a penalty rate, 3. Against good collateral
- Penalty rate:
- Compensation for providing "insurance" to banks
- Last resort lending is risky, compensation for taking risks
- Good collateral:
- Central bank should limit lending to deserving banks. But how?
- Define deserving as banks that have good collateral.
- Banks in liquidity crisis vs. solvency crisis
# Liquidity Crisis vs. Solvency Crisis
- Liquidity problem:
- Bank fundamentally solvent
- Faces a run and needs liquidity (assets illiquid)
- Has good collateral for central bank to lend against
Central bank will make money on emergency loans
- Solvency problem:
- Bank fundamentally insolvent
- Assets worth less than liabilities
- Doesn’t have enough good collateral
- Central bank would lose money if they bailed bank out
- Fiscally costly bailouts should be decided on by elected officials
# Liquidity Crisis vs. Solvency Crisis
- But how should bank assets be valued?
- Crisis leads to fire sale of assets
- Value of assets falls below “fundamental” value
- Fundamental value: value when crisis subsides
- Should central bank value assets at fundamental value or market value?
- Hard to figure out fundamental value
- “Fog of war” makes these decisions hard in a crisis
# Persistence of Banking Panics in U.S.
- No more panics in England after 1866
- Regular panics in U.S. for another 70 years
Why?
Table 1: U.S. Banking Panics, 1866-1929

Note: Replicates a portion of Table 2 in Jalil (2015).
# Persistence of Banking Panics in U.S.
# 1. Absence of a central bank
U.S had no central bank from 1836 (Jackson’s veto) to 1913 (Fed established)
- No lender of last resort
# 2. Unit banking
- No interstate banking until 1970s / No branching in many states
- Banks small and undiversified. Especially fragile.
- Canada had national branch banks and no banking crises
# Deposit Insurance
- U.S. had a lender of last resort after 1913, but experiences massive banking crisis during Great Depression
Fed failed to act
- U.S. instituted federal deposit insurance in 1933
- Deposit insurance eliminates the run equilibrium in Diamond-Dybvig model
- Sylvia doesn’t want to run (even if others do) because her deposits are insured
- Ushered in “quiet period” of financial stability
# Bank Regulation
- Core problem: Bank runs
- Direct policy response: Last resort lending and despot insurance
- Knock on problem: Moral hazard
- Policy response to moral hazard: capital and liquidity regulation
- Also: Deposit financing too cheap due to tax incentives (profits net of interest payment on debt are taxed).

Figure 19: Capital of National Banks in the United States
# Basel I
1988 G-10 agreement on capital regulation
- Minimum capital ratios:
4\% Tier 1 capital ratio
8\% Total capital ratio
- Capital relative to risk-weighted assets
- Risk weights:
- 0\%: Cash, central government debt
10\%: Public sector debt
20\%: Claims on other banks
- $50\%$ : Residential mortgages
100\% Commercial and industrial loans
# Basel II
- Focus on improving risk weights
Large banks could use internal models to assess risk
- Trading accounts involve a lot of hedging
- Use of internal models allowed banks to take account of hedging
- Better risk weights supposed to reduce regulatory arbitrage
- E.g., Package mortgages into securities, sell off high trances, hold lowest trances (which have most of the risk), lower capital requirement
- Downside: Internal risk models biased
# Financial Crisis – Basel III
- Financial crisis of 2007-09 led to calls for more stringent capital requirements
- Response: Basel III and Dodd-Frank in U.S.
Higher capital ratios
- More detailed risk weights (some higher than  $100\%$ )
- Leverage ratios (un-risk-weighted capital ratios)
G-SIBs (Globally systemically important banks due to “too big to fail”)
- Stress tests (forward looking, central bank model)

# Long Run Versus Short Run

Classical economics:

- Emphasizes self-equilibrating forces (supply=demand, long-run monetary neutrality)
- In the long run, these forces bring about good outcomes
- But economies are buffeted by shocks that result in serious pathologies such as high inflation and high unemployment
- Great Depression, Early 1980s recession, 2007-2009 financial crisis
# Long Run Versus Short Run

But this "long run" is a misleading guide to current affairs. "In the long run" we are all dead.

Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.

- John Maynard Keynes
# Long Run Versus Short Run
- (Keynesian) Macroeconomics:
- Born as separate sub-discipline in the Great Depression
- Obvious that long-run forces not working well
- Increased focus on workings of the economy in the short run
- Increased focus on "business cycles" and crises
# Business Cycles
- Output fluctuates around a trend
- Fluctuations called business cycles
- Recurrent but not periodic
- Last approximately from 2 to 10 years
- Phases:
- Expansion phase (trough to peak)
- Contraction phase (peak to trough)
- "Official" arbiter:
- Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/f46d039ee18647176b6eebf8e6acb1a9ca42e0001e3c6d4cc7f0bf2d6419fbd8.jpg)
# Trend and Cycle
- Useful to decompose output into trend and cycle
- We think of trend output as "potential output" or the "natural rate of output". Let's denote this as  $\bar{Y}_{t}$ .
- We define the output gap as percentage deviations of output from potential output
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} = \frac{Y_{t} - \bar {Y}_{t}}{\bar {Y}_{t}} \approx \log \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{\bar {Y}_{t}}\right)
$$
# The Trend: Potential Output
- Here I plot output (real GDP) and potential output as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office
- Difference looks small relative to growth in output
These differences are recessions and booms
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/689dc07e10e012b035e875427ab59b674e3435c33eb8564ccc7d1182f5f74a36.jpg)
# The Business Cycle
- Here I plot the output gap measured as the difference between log output and log potential output (from CBO)
- Recessions cause up to  $10\%$  fall in output relative to potential
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/b0e898c2d4a3274b3401d787bcac0503206108dedfd338a166a281dba3068afe.jpg)
# Our First "Business Cycle" Model
- Medieval Economy:
- Money market equilibrium:
$$
M_{t} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Price Adjustment:
$$
\frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
- Many things missing:
- No trend growth
- No steady state inflation
- No unemployment
- No interest rate
- No monetary policy
- No fiscal policy
- Etc.
# Add Trend Growth
- Let's add trend growth to medieval economy
- Steady state becomes "trend growth path"
- We assume that TFP has a positive trend growth rate. So we have  $A_{t}$  rather than  $A$ .  $(A_{t}$  is still exogenous.)
Actual output:  $Y_{t} = A_{t} L_{t}$
- Potential output (natural rate of output):  $\bar{Y}_{t} = A_{t} L^{*}$
- Employment is at desired level  $L^{*}$  when output is at potential
# Medieval Economy with Trend Growth
- Medieval economy without trend growth
$$
M_{t} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t} \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
- Medieval economy with trend growth
$$
M_{t} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t} \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y_{t}^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
- Only difference is that  $Y^{*}$  becomes  $Y_{t}^{*}$
# Business Cycle Model
- Can we use concepts of supply and demand to think about the Medieval economy model?
- Let's start with the money market equilibrium condition:
$$
M_{t} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Take logs and time differences:
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \Delta \log P_{t} + \Delta \log Y_{t}
$$
# Money Market Equilibrium
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \Delta \log P_{t} + \Delta \log Y_{t}
$$

Inflation:

$$
\Delta \log P_{t} = \log \left(\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}}\right) = \log (1 + \pi_{t}) \approx \pi_{t}
$$
- Output gap:
$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta \log Y_{t} = \log Y_{t} - \log Y_{t - 1} + \log \bar {Y}_{t} - \log \bar {Y}_{t} + \log \bar {Y}_{t - 1} - \log \bar {Y}_{t - 1} \\ = \log (Y_{t} / \bar {Y}_{t}) - \log (Y_{t - 1} / \bar {Y}_{t - 1}) + \log (\bar {Y}_{t} / \bar {Y}_{t - 1}) \\ \approx \tilde {Y}_{t} - \tilde {Y}_{t - 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

This yields:

$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \pi_{t} + \tilde {Y}_{t} - \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$

We drop this term. Think of it as a constant that doesn't contribute anything interesting to the analysis

# Money Market Equilibrium as Aggregate Demand
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \pi_{t} + \tilde {Y}_{t} - \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$

We can rewrite this as

$$
\pi_{t} = - \tilde {Y}_{t} + \tilde {Y}_{t - 1} + \Delta \log M_{t}
$$
- Plot this relationship in  $(\pi_t, \tilde{Y}_t)$  space
- Downward sloping locus of points
We call this the aggregate demand curve
Inflation

Output gap
# Price Setting Equation
$$
\frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t}}{Y_{t}^{*}}\right)^{\theta} \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}} = \left(\frac{Y_{t - 1}}{Y_{t - 1}^{*}}\right)^{\theta}
$$
- Replace:  $Y_{t}^{*}$  with  $\overline{Y}_t$  (i.e., assume desired output is same as potential output)
Take logs:
$$
\log \left(\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}}\right) = \theta \log \left(\frac{Y_{t - 1}}{\overline {{Y}}_{t - 1}}\right)
$$
$$
\pi_{t} = \theta \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$
# Short Run Aggregate Supply
$$
\pi_{t} = \theta \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$
- Very simple short-run aggregate supply relation
What is its slope?
- Short run:
- Inflation is fixed
- Predetermined one period in advance
- Horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS)
Inflation

# Output Gap and Unemployment
- Measuring output gap is tricky!
- Trend productivity growth varies over time
- Productivity slowdown in 1970s
- Productivity speedup between 1995-2004
- Hard to know exactly how to draw a trend line for output
- Alternative: Look at unemployment
# Unemployment Rate
- Unemployment rate rises during recessions and falls during expansions

- But what is the "natural rate" of unemployment?
- Should we aim for zero unemployment?

# Natural Rate of Unemployment

People quit and are fired

- Takes time for them to search for new jobs
- Natural rate of unemployment reflects this "frictional" unemployment
Here I plot CBO estimate of "non-cyclical" unemployment
Is natural rate really that high?

# Full Employment Rate of Unemployment
- Michaillat and Saez: Want to minimize nonproductive use of labor
- Two types of "nonproductive" use of labor
- 1) Unemployment  $(u)$
NaN. Recruitment  $(v)$
- These are necessary, but don't produce output
- When  $u > v$  labor market is too slack
- When  $u < v$  labor market is too tight
- Productive labor is maximized when  $u = v$  which implies
$$ u^{*} = \sqrt{u v}
$$

# Okun's Law
- Useful to be able to go back and forth between output and unemployment
- During recessions output is low and the unemployment rate is high
- "Stable" empirical relationship:
$$ u_{t} - u^{n} = - \frac{1}{2} \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$

This is called "Okun's Law"

# Lecture 13: Interest Rates and Money Demand: The LM Curve

Macroeconomics (Quantitative)

Economics 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Where Do We Stand
- Money market equilibrium / Aggregate demand:
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \pi_{t} + \tilde {Y}_{t} - \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$
- Price setting equation / Short-run aggregate supply:
$$
\pi_{t} = \theta \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$
- Okun's Law:
$$ u_{t} - u^{n} = - \frac{1}{2} \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$
# Next Step
- Modernize our model of aggregate demand
- In medieval model, aggregate demand depends only on money holdings. Rather simplistic.
Now we make demand depend on: Interest rates
- But before we do that, we should discuss interest rates and asset returns
# Asset Returns
- If you purchase an asset, you expect to get a return
- How do we measure a return?
- Suppose you buy an asset at time  $t$  for  $\$ P_t$
- One period later you sell it for  $P_{t + 1}$
What is the rate of return?
- Gross return:
$$
(1 + R_{t + 1}) = \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}}
$$
- Net return:
$$
R_{t + 1} = \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \frac{P_{t + 1} - P_{t}}{P_{t}}
$$
# Interest Rate at the Bank
- Say you invest 1 in a savings account at a bank that offers a 3\% interest rate per year
- In one year's time you will have 1.03
- Gross return:
$$
\left(1 + R_{t + 1}^{b}\right) = \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}} = \frac{1 . 0 3}{1} = 1. 0 3
$$
- Net return:
$$
R_{t + 1}^{b} = \frac{P_{t + 1} - P_{t}}{P_{t}} = \frac{1.03 - 1}{1} = 0.03 = 3 \%
$$
# Returns over Many Periods

What if you hold the asset for many periods?

- Gross return over two periods:
$$
\frac{P_{t + 2}}{P_{t}} = \frac{P_{t + 2}}{P_{t + 1}} \frac{P_{t + 1}}{P_{t}}
$$
- Product of two successive one-period gross returns
- Gross returns multiply over time (compounding)
- Money in the bank:
- Two period return:  $\left(1 + R^{b}\right)^{2}$
- T-period return:  $\left(1 + R^{b}\right)^{T}$
# Compound Interest
- Suppose you had invested 100 in the stock market (S&P500) in January 1950 and held it until January 2025 reinvesting all dividends
- In January 2025, you would have 26,568
- This is a  $7.72\%$  compounded annual rate of return:  $1.0772^{75} \approx 265$
- Simple interest:  \$75 \times \0.0772 = \$ 5.79
- Compound interest is  $265 -$ 6 = 259
# Power of Compound Interest
- In 1626, Peter Minuit is said to have purchased Manhattan Island from natives for 60 guilders
- 60 guilders said to be equivalent to 24
- Say natives had invested proceeds at  $5 \%$ per year. How much would they have today?
$$
\$ 24 \times (1 + 0.05)^{399} \cong \$ 6,800,000,000
$$

("only" 3 billion when I started teaching this course in 2008)

# Interest Rates and Bond Prices
- Simple (zero-coupon) bond:
– Promise to pay 1 one year from now
- Price in the market today  $P_{t}$
- Yield to maturity: Return you would get if you held bond to maturity. (Often called "yield" or "interest rate")
What is the yield to maturity on our simple bond?
$$
(1 + i_{t}) = \frac{1}{P_{t}}
$$
- Bond prices and bond yield move in opposite directions!!
# Nominal vs. Real Returns
- Nominal returns:
- Returns measured in dollars
- Not "corrected" for inflation
- Dollar today buys less "stuff" than a dollar did 10 years ago
- Might be interested in returns in terms of "stuff"
Real returns:
- Returns "corrected" for inflation
- Prices of asset at different time deflated by overall price index for that time
— Asset prices measured in "year 2020" dollars (for example)
# Real Returns
- Deflate asset prices by price index (say CPI):
$$
\frac{P_{t}}{C P I_{t}} \qquad \frac{P_{t + 1}}{C P I_{t + 1}}
$$
- Calculate (ex post) return using "real" prices:
$$
1 + R_{t + 1}^{r} = \frac{P_{t + 1} / C P I_{t + 1}}{P_{t} / C P I_{t}} = \frac{P_{t + 1} / P_{t}}{C P I_{t + 1} / C P I_{t}} = \frac{1 + R_{t + 1}^{n}}{1 + \pi_{t + 1}}
$$
$$
R_{t + 1}^{r} \approx R_{t + 1}^{n} - \pi_{t + 1}
$$

Value Weighted NYSE/AMEX

# Fisher Equation
- Fisher equation:
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1}
$$
- Fisher equation is the definition of the ex ante real interest rate
- Ex ante real interest rate: Real interest rate people except at time  $t$  to prevail from time  $t$  to time  $t + 1$
$-\pi_{t+1}$  is not known until period  $t + 1$
- Ex post real interest rate:  $R_{t + 1}^{post} = i_t - \pi_{t + 1}$
- What real interest rate turned out to be between times  $t$  and  $t + 1$
# Tricky Notation
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1}
$$
- $i_{t}$  and  $R_{t}$  denote the nominal and ex ante real interest rates from time  $t$  and  $t + 1$
- $\pi_{t+1}$  denotes inflation between time  $t$  and  $t+1$
- Notice the difference in time subscripts!!!
- Time subscripts correspond to when variable is known
# Expectations Formation
- How do people form expectations?
- Assumption (Adaptive expectations):
Assume that people look at the past to form expectation:
$$
E_{t} \pi_{t + 1} = \pi_{t}
$$

Alternative: Rational Expectations

- People form "model consistent" expectations
- Use all information available correctly
- Make no systematic mistakes
# Real Interest Rate
- Ex ante real interest rate
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1}
$$
- With adaptive expectations, this becomes
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - \pi_{t}
$$
# Real versus Nominal
- The difference between real and nominal is a crucial aspect of being reasonably informed about macro events
- Common to see people confused about this:
- E.g.: "Interest rates have trended down for thirty years.
Why hasn't investment surged?"
- Or: "We earned much higher returns in the 1970's than now"

# Modernizing Money Demand

In Medieval economy:

- Gold coins only available asset
- People had desired level "real money balances":
$$
M_{t}^{d} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$

19th and early 20th century:

- Paper money and deposits become an important component of money supply
$$
M = \frac{C / D + 1}{C / D + R / D} M_{b} = B_{m} M_{b}
$$
# Modernizing Money Demand
- People have access to other stores of value than money
- Face a trade-off between holding money and other stores of value such as real estate, stocks, bond, etc.
What is the nature of this trade-off?
- What are the benefits of holding money relative to other assets?
- What are the costs of holding money relative to other assets?
# Modernizing Money Demand
- Benefits of holding money:
- Money is more "liquid"
- i.e., more convenient for making payments
- Cost of holding money:
- Money does not pay interest (or pays less interest)
- Stocks, bonds, real estate have higher average returns than checking accounts
# Modernizing Money Demand
- Consider the trade-off between bonds and money
- The nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money
- The higher is the nominal interest rate, the lower is demand for money
We need to incorporate nominal interest rate into our model of money demand
# Modernizing Money Demand
$$
\log M_{t} + \log V_{t} = \log P_{t} + \log Y_{t}
$$
- New assumption: The velocity of money is an increasing function of the nominal interest rate
$$
\log V_{t} = \phi i_{t} - v_{t}
$$
- Equivalently: money demand a decreasing function of the nominal interest rates
- Here  $v_{t}$  is a "money demand shock", i.e., other factors that affect velocity (e.g., financial innovation (ATMs, credit cards))
# Modern Money Demand
- This implies that money demand becomes:
$$
\log M_{t} + \log V_{t} = \log P_{t} + \log Y_{t}
$$
$$
\log M_{t} + \phi i_{t} - v_{t} = \log P_{t} + \log Y_{t}
$$
$$
\log M_{t} - \log P_{t} = - \phi i_{t} + \log Y_{t} + v_{t}
$$
- Downward-sloping function of nominal interest rates

# Money Supply
- Modern economy: Central bank can vary the money supply at will
In particular: Central Bank can set money supply at each point in time to achieve any interest rate it desires
Central bank can effectively control the nominal interest rate by varying money supply
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/108cbfe95c6ea79ab061edaea9af091e42d517d548c3f07ea86aebaea4d93dec.jpg)
# Money Demand Shocks
- Money demand shocks shift the money demand curve
Unless central bank offsets this, will affect interest rate
In  $19^{\text{th }}$  century, interest rates would rise during harvest time due to increase in money demand
- No central bank to offset
Money supply not "elastic"
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/c389b9ffdbff7d3b57d67e5d46586a27641bf2df3b9b5a279930c55da30d0a5b.jpg)
# Money Market Equilibrium
- We can now write money market equilibrium equation in terms of real interest rate by combining:
$$
\log M_{t} - \log P_{t} = - \phi i_{t} + \log Y_{t} + v_{t}
$$
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - \pi_{t}
$$

This yields:

$$
\log M_{t} - \log P_{t} = - \phi (R_{t} + \pi_{t}) + \log Y_{t} + v_{t}
$$
- Rearranging yields:
$$
R_{t} = \phi^{- 1} \log Y_{t} - \pi_{t} + \phi^{- 1} (v_{t} - \log M_{t} + \log P_{t})
$$
# LM Curve
$$
R_{t} = \phi^{- 1} \log Y_{t} - \pi_{t} + \phi^{- 1} (v_{t} - \log M_{t} + \log P_{t})
$$
- We can plot this equation in  $(Y_{t}, R_{t})$  space
- This curve is called the LM curve
- Notice that changes to both money demand  $(v_{t})$  and money supply  $(\log M_{t})$  shift the LM curve

# Lecture 14:
# Interest Rates and the Goods Market

Macroeconomics (Quantitative)

Economics 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Keynes' Consumption Function

Keynes (1936, p. 96):

- "The fundamental psychological law, upon which we are entitled to depend with great confidence both a priori and from our knowledge of human nature and from detailed facts of experience, is that men are disposed, as a rule and on average, to increase their consumption as their income increases, but not by as much as the increase in their income."
# Keynes' Consumption Function

Keynes (1936, p. 93-94):

- "The usual type of short-period fluctuation in the rate of interest is not likely, however, to have much direct influence on spending either way. There are not many people who will alter their way of living because the rate of interest has fallen from 5 to 4 per cent, if their aggregate income is the same as before."
# Keynes' Consumption Function
- Consumption a function of after-tax income
$$
C = \alpha + \gamma (Y - T)
$$
- Marginal propensity to consume  $\gamma$  between zero and one
- Interest rate not important
- Future income not important
# Introspection about Consumption
- Suppose you received a surprise one-time 1,000 scholarship
- How much would you spend within a year?
(on goods and services, not paying down debt)
- How about a one-time 10,000 scholarship?
- How about a one-time 100,000 scholarship?
# Introspection about Consumption
- Suppose interest rate rose by 1 percentage point
- How much more would you save over a year as a fraction of your annual consumption?
# Keynesian Cross
- Planned expenditures (demand):
$$
P E = C + I + G + N X
$$
- Suppose  $I, G$ , and  $NX$  are "exogenous"
(i.e., not affected by level of output or interest rates)
- Suppose  $C$  is given by Keynes' consumption function
- Suppose output is determined by demand
# Keynesian Cross
- Output must equal planned expenditures:
$$
Y = \alpha + \gamma (Y - T) + I + G + N X
$$
- A little bit of algebra then gives:
$$
Y = \frac{1}{1 - \gamma} [ \alpha - \gamma T + I + G + N X ]
$$

Government purchases multiplier  $= \frac{1}{1 - \gamma}$

Tax cut multiplier  $= \frac{\gamma}{1 - \gamma}$

# Keynesian Cross
- If marginal propensity to consumer is  $2 / 3$
- Government purchases multiplier is 3
- Tax cut multiplier is 2
- Multiplier for extra investment or consumption is 3
- Logic:
- Government spends  $\Delta G$
(external income for households)
- Households spend extra  $\gamma \Delta G$  (more extra income)
- Households spend extra  $\gamma^{2} \Delta G$
- Etc.
# Keynesian Cross

Planned Expenditures

- Planned expenditure:
$$
P E = \alpha + \gamma (Y - T) + I + G + N X
$$
- Equilibrium dictates
$$
Y = P E
$$

Output

# Keynesian Cross

Keynesian economics in its simplest form

- Very strong assumptions:
- Consumption and investment not affected by interest rates (or future income)
- Prices not affected by changes in output
- We next consider a slightly more sophisticated version, where demand depends on the interest rate
# The IS Curve
- Same starting point:
$$
P E = C + I + G + N X
$$
- But consumption and investment affected by interest rate:
$$
P E = C (Y, r) + I (r) + G + N X (r)
$$
- Goods market equilibrium:
$$
Y = P E
$$
$$
Y = C (Y, r) + I (r) + G + N X (r)
$$
# Consumption
$$
C_{t} = a_{c} \bar {Y}_{t} - b_{c} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Let's try to captures basic idea of the permanent income hypothesis:
- Consumption not a function of current income, rather potential income since it helps forecast future (lifetime) income
- Negative relationship between consumption and real interest rate (relative to "natural rate"  $\bar{r}$ )
- Slightly more sophisticated than in Jones
# Investment
$$
I_{t} = \bar {a}_{i} \bar {Y}_{t} - \bar {b}_{i} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Same as consumption:
- Investment a function of permanent income since it helps forecast future demand and profitability
- Investment negatively affected by real interest rate (relative to "natural rate"  $\bar{r}$ )
- Higher interest rate, lower investment
# Imports
- Most of imports are consumption and investment
- So, consistency dictates that
$$
I M_{t} = a_{i m} \bar {Y}_{t} - b_{i m} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- This is again slightly more sophisticated than in Jones
# Government Spending and Exports
- Government spending:
- Assumed to be exogenous
$$
G_{t} = \bar {a}_{g} \bar {Y}_{t}
$$
- Exports:
- Assumed to be exogenous
$$
E X_{t} = \bar {a}_{e x} \bar {Y}_{t}
$$
# Planned Expenditure
$$
P E_{t} = C_{t} + I_{t} + G_{t} + E X_{t} - I M_{t}
$$
- Consumption:
$$
C_{t} = a_{c} \bar {Y}_{t} - b_{c} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Investment:
$$
I_{t} = \bar {a}_{i} \bar {Y}_{t} - \bar {b}_{i} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Imports:
$$
I M_{t} = a_{i m} \bar {Y}_{t} - b_{i m} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Government spending and exports:
$$
G_{t} = \bar {a}_{g} \bar {Y}_{t} E X_{t} = \bar {a}_{e x} \bar {Y}_{t}
$$
# IS Curve
- In equilibrium output equals planned expenditures:
$$
Y_{t} = C_{t} + I_{t} + G_{t} + E X_{t} - I M_{t}
$$
- Plugging in for  $C_t, I_t, G_t, EX_t, IM_t$ :
$$
Y_{t} = \bar {a}_{P E} \bar {Y}_{t} - \bar {b}_{P E} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$ where
$$

\begin{array}{l} \bar {a}_{P E} = \bar {a}_{c} + \bar {a}_{i} + \bar {a}_{g} + \bar {a}_{e x} - \bar {a}_{i m} \\ \overline {{b}}_{P E} = \overline {{b}}_{c} + \overline {{b}}_{i} - \overline {{b}}_{i m} \\ \end{array}

$$
# IS Curve
$$

Y_{t} = \bar {a}_{P E} \bar {Y}_{t} - \bar {b}_{P E} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})

$$
- Let's now divide through by  $\bar{Y}_{t}$  and subtract 1 from each side:
$$

\frac{Y_{t}}{\bar {Y}_{t}} - 1 = (\bar {a}_{P E} - 1) - \bar {b}_{P E} (R_{t} - \bar {r})

$$
$$

\tilde {Y}_{t} = \bar {a} - \bar {b} (R_{t} - \bar {r})

$$
# IS Curve
• IS curve gives demand as a function of the interest rate
Higher interest rate lowers demand
- Planned expenditure lines are flat because demand a function of  $\overline{Y}_{t}$  not  $Y_{t}$

# "One-Line" Intuition
- How changes in interest rates affect the demand for goods, and thus output
- Negative relationship between R and Y
$$

R \downarrow \Rightarrow C^{d} \uparrow \mathrm{an d} I^{d} \uparrow \Rightarrow Y \uparrow

$$
# IS Curve
• Where did the name come from?
- Investment:
$$

I_{t} = \bar {a}_{i} \bar {Y}_{t} - \bar {b}_{i} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})

$$
• Savings:
$$

S_{t} = Y_{t} - \bar {a}_{s} \bar {Y}_{t} + \bar {b}_{s} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})

$$
Equilibrium:
$$

I_{t} = S_{t}

# IS Curve Shocks
- Expectations shock (Optimism):
- Positive revision of expectations about the future
- Expect more growth/higher income in the future
- What happens today?
- Consumption and investment increase
$$

C_{t} = \bar {a}_{c}^{\prime} \bar {Y}_{t} - \bar {b}_{c} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r}), \mathrm{wh er e} \bar {a}_{c}^{\prime} > \bar {a}_{c}

$$
$$

# What Shifts the IS Curve?
•  $\Delta$  government spending (G)
-  $\Delta$  lump sum taxes (T)
-  $\Delta$  expected future income or output
- Δ wealth
•  $\Delta$  investment for reasons other than change in R (i.e. autonomous shock to I)
•  $\Delta$  consumption for reasons other than change in  $R$  (i.e., "autonomous" shock to  $C$ )
# IS Curve and Credit Constraints
In above derivation:
- Consumption, investment, etc. functions of potential output, not actual output
- Theoretical justification: Permanent income hypothesis
- Liquidity constraints:
- Some consumers can’t borrow against future income
- Are credit constrained
# IS Curve and Credit Constraints
- What will credit constrained households do if they get extra income?
- Spend it!
- They would like to borrow and consume more
- If their income rises temporarily, they spend the extra income
These households are said to live “hand-to-mouth”
# Credit Constraints and the MPC
- Marginal propensity to consume (MPC):
- If you get an extra dollar, how much do you spend (over say a 3 month period)
- In permanent income hypothesis model, the MPC is very low (close to zero)
- Credit constrained agents have a very high MPC
# Measuring the MPC
- Parker, Souleles, Johnson, McClelland (2012):
- Look at 2008 Economic Stimulus Payments
- People got checks from the government
- Timing was random (based on last digits of SS#)
- Compare those that got a check at time  $t$  with those that didn't (treatment vs. control)
- How much more did treated people spend over a 3 month period

# Hand-to-Mouth Consumers
- Assumption: A fraction of households are credit constrained and spend temporary increases in income. Aggregate consumption is then:
$$

C_{t} = \overline {{a}}_{c}^{\prime} \overline {{Y}}_{t} + \bar {x} Y_{t} - \overline {{b}}_{c} \overline {{Y}}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})

$$ where  $0 < \bar{x} < 1$

- Reasonable value for  $\bar{x}$ ?
- Perhaps 0.25 based on Parker et al. (2012)
# Hand-to-Mouth Consumers
$$
C_{t} = \bar {a}_{c}^{\prime} \bar {Y}_{t} + \bar {x} Y_{t} - \bar {b}_{c} \bar {Y}_{t} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Extra term reflects hand-to-mouth consumers
- Since their spending rises and falls one for one with actual output (as opposed to potential output), aggregate consumption will vary with the output
- This turns out to have important consequences
# IS Curve with Hand-to-Mouth Consumers
- Same steps as before yield:
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} = \bar {a} + \bar {x} \tilde {Y}_{t} - \bar {b} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
$$
(1 - \bar {x}) \tilde {Y}_{t} = \bar {a} - \bar {b} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} = \frac{1}{1 - \bar {x}} \left[ \bar {a} - \bar {b} (R_{t} - \bar {r}) \right]
$$
- Multiplier effect: Any change in  $\bar{a}$  or  $R_{t}$  have a larger effect on the output gap than before
# IS Curve with Hand-to-Mouth Consumers
- Planned expenditure lines are now upward sloping because consumption a function of  $Y_{t}$
- Implies that shift in  $R_{t}$  has a bigger effect on  $Y_{t}$

# Multiplier Effect

What is the intuition for the multiplier effect?

- Say foreign demand falls by  $1 \%$
Without multiplier: Output falls by  $1 \%$
- With multiplier:
- Fall in output implies a fall in the income of hand-to-mouth consumers
- They reduce their consumption.
- This further reduces output, and on and on
# Multiplier Effect
- Initial fall in foreign demand:  $1\%$
- $1^{st}$  round fall in consumption:  $\overline{x}\%$
- $2^{nd}$  round fall in consumption:  $\overline{x}^{2}$
- $3^{rd}$  round fall in consumption:  $\bar{x}^{3}$
- Etc., Etc.
- Total effect:
$$
1 + \bar {x} + \bar {x}^{2} + \bar {x}^{3} + \dots = \frac{1}{1 - \bar {x}}
$$
# Where Do We Stand?

Money Market (LM Curve):

$$
\log M_{t} - \log P_{t} = - \phi i_{t} + \log Y_{t} + v_{t}
$$
- Fisher Equation:
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1}
$$
- Price Setting Equation:
$$
\pi_{t} = \theta \tilde {Y}_{t - 1}
$$
- Goods Market (IS Curve):
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} = \bar {a} - \bar {b} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
- Okun's Law:
$$ u_{t} - u^{n} = - \frac{1}{2} \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$
# IS-LM Model
- Short-run model
- Determines output gap and real interest rate
- Inflation predetermined (unaffected by output)
Money market shocks shift the LM curve
- Goods market shocks shift the IS curve

# What Caused the Great Depression
- IS curve shock?
Stock market crash of October 1929
- Also, massive volatility in stock market created uncertainty about the future
- Consumers / firms adopt wait and see attitude

# What Caused the Great Depression
- LM curve shock?
- Tight monetary policy in U.S. in 1928/29 to counteract stock market boom
- Tight monetary policy globally because of gold standard constraints
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/cdaade9c999912152e2ed84a60ff9f4acaa50b090bfcce72ff852723bfd4c2cb.jpg)
# Money Supply on the Gold Standard
- Recall that  $M = B_{m}M_{b}$
Determination of  $M_{b}$  on gold standard:
$$
M_{b} = \frac{M_{b}}{M_{g}} M_{g} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{GC R}} M_{g}
$$
- $M_{g}$  is monetary gold, i.e., gold held at the Treasury (or central bank) to back the monetary base
- GCR is the "gold cover ratio" amount by which central bank leverages up the monetary gold
# Money Supply on the Gold Standard
$$
M = B_{m} \frac{1}{\mathrm{GC R}} M_{g}
$$
- $M_{g}$ : Determined by gold flows into or out of country
- If goods are cheap in country, more exports than imports, and gold will flow into country
- GCR: Determined by central bank (monetary policy). But usually lower limits set by law (e.g., 40\% in US)
- $B_{m}$ : Determined by banks and the public ( $C / D$  and  $R / D$ )
# Did France Cause the Great Depression?
- "Rules of the game" of the gold standard:
- Allow inflows and outflows of gold to affect money supply
- "Rules" were supposed to be an equilibrating force:
- Money supply affects prices, which then stops gold flows
- But during this period the world experienced a huge deflationary episode – the Great Depression. What went wrong?
- France (and U.S.) arguably violated the "rules of the game" by hoarding gold without creating money (i.e. raised GCR)
# Monetary Policy in France and U.S.
- High inflation in 1923-1926 lead to great conservatism in French monetary policy in the years leading up to Great Depression
- They wanted to avoid another such experience
- France experienced large gold inflows, which they allowed to raise gold cover ratio
- France liquidated holdings of sterling which raised the gold cover ratio

# Monetary Policy in U.S. and Germany
U.S. and Germany also worried about holding sterling as reserves and liquidated holdings (i.e. raised gold cover ratios)
- Generally, lack of trust across countries led to scramble for gold by all central banks, which worsened aggregate shortage of gold
# Monetary Policy in 1928-1929
- Loss of gold forced U.K. to raise interest rates
— Higher interest rates meant to entice investors to send money to Britain
- Higher interest rates also deflationary (reduce spending by households and firms)
U.S. Fed raised interest rates as well
- Worried about boom on Wall Street
- Worried about outflow of gold to France

# Deflationary Monetary Policy
$$
M = M_{g} \times \frac{1}{\mathrm{GC R}} \times B_{m}
$$
- Policy by France and U.S. to raise GCR lead to a fall in the world money supply
What consequences does this have?
$$
\Delta \log M = \Delta \log P + \Delta \log Y
$$
- Deflationary pressure
- In the short run, prices were sluggish and output dropped
# From Recession to Depression
These monetary policy actions were likely one of the impulses causing the onset of the Great Depression
- But how did an initially mild recession turn into a massive economy calamity?
- To understand that, we need to shift our focus to  $B_{m}$
$$
M = M_{g} \times \frac{1}{\mathrm{GC R}} \times B_{m}
$$
# Bank Crises During the Great Depression
Three large bank panics:
- November 1930 to January 1931: 800 banks fail
- September 1931 to October 1931: 800 banks fail
- December 1932 to March 1933: 4000 banks fail
— State and then general bank holiday
Number of banks fell from 24,000 to 14,000 between 1929 and 1933
# Collapse of Money Multiplier
$$
M = M_{g} \times \frac{1}{\mathrm{GC R}} \times B_{m}
$$
- The money multiplier  $B_{m}$  collapsed during the Great Depression as people withdrew money from banks and banks raised reserve ratios

# Fed as a Lender of Last Resort
- Failed miserably in the Great Depression
- 9,000 banks failed
- 1/3 of all banks in U.S.
- Many scholars believe these banking panics played a significant role in the severity of the Great Depression (fall in  $B_{m}$ )
U.S. introduced deposit insurance in 1930's to lessen reliance on lender of last resort (no more bank runs for 70 years)
# Massive Monetary Policy Mistake
I would like to say to Milton and Anna:
Regarding the Great Depression.
You're right, we did it. We're very sorry.
But thanks to you, we won't do it again
Ben Bernanke
Governor of Federal Reserve
November 8, 2002
# Gold Standard as Root Cause
- Several reasons why Fed screwed up
- Strong belief in the importance of adherence to gold standard was one important reason
$$
M = M_{g} \times \frac{M_{b}}{M_{g}} \times \frac{M_{b} + D}{M_{b}}
$$
- Limited scope to increase  $M_{b} / M_{g}$  (reduce GCR)
- Legal lower limit on gold cover ratio
- Worry about speculative attack
- Should never have allowed  $B_{m}$  to fall as it did
- But even lender of last resort actions involved some increase in  $M_{b} / M_{g}$
# Monetary Narrative of Great Depression
- France hoarded gold from 1926 onward
- Caused a fall in world money supply
- Rigidity of prices led output to fall
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \Delta \log P_{t} + \Delta \log Y_{t}
$$
Downturn led to banking panics
- Fed didn't react,  $B_{m}$  fell sharply
- Recession became a depression
$$
M = M_{g} \times \frac{1}{\mathrm{GC R}} \times B_{m}
$$
# Correlation versus Causation
- How do we know correlation runs from money to output as opposed to reverse causation or some third factor?
- Narrative above based on detailed historical research
- But we don't have a treatment group and a control group to compare
Unfortunately, no parallel universes some with Great Depressions some not
# Four Natural Experiments
- Bernanke argues that Friedman and Schwartz identify four natural experiments:
- Changes in money stock occurs for reasons largely unrelated to the contemporaneous behavior of prices and output
- Since movements in money are "exogenous" one can interpret response of economy as reflecting cause and effect
# Four Natural Experiments
1. Tight monetary policy in 1928-29
2. Sterling Crisis of 1931
- Fed raises rates after Britain forced off gold
3. Easing in spring of 1932
— Congress pressured Fed to ease. They did. Economy started improving. Congress adjourned in July. Fed went back to old ways. Economy resumed collapse
4. Run on the dollar
- Speculation about whether Roosevelt would take dollar off gold standard. Slow run on dollar and banks

Figure 6 Monthly Index of Industrial Production
# International Evidence
- Countries that exited gold standard earlier experienced less severe Depression and recovered earlier
Correlation versus causation?
What is most obvious "confounding factor"?
- Countries that leave gold standard are more likely to have been hit harder initially (since speculators pray on weak countries)
This confounding factor actually strengthens the case

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, 1929-1935
# Speculative Attacks
- Summer and fall of 1931:
- Series of speculative attacks on currencies that were on the gold standard
- Culminated in Britain going off the gold standard in September of 1931
- Speculative attacks on currencies with fixed exchange rates have been common ever since
- Often very traumatic events!
- Let's try to understand these events a bit better
# The Sterling Crisis
- In May 1931, the Austrian bank Credit-Anstalt failed and was bailed out by the Austrian government.
- This led investors to doubt Austria's ability to maintain the gold standard and flee.
- Austria responded by:
- Seeking foreign loans (didn't get enough)
- Raising interest rates, raising taxes, cutting spending
- Eventually, suspended convertibility (and imposed capital controls)
# Crisis Spreads
- The Credit-Anstalt crisis quickly spread to Hungary and more importantly Germany
- Germany suspends convertibility in September (and imposed capital controls)
- Many other countries also suspend convertibility and imposed capital controls around this time for similar reasons (e.g., Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina)
# Sterling Comes Under Attack
- The next country investors started to worry about was Britain (the center of the financial system at the time)
- Crisis had weakened Britain's Balance of Payments
- Relied heavily on investment income from abroad
- Capital controls imposed by other countries eliminated that income from country after country
- Speculators started worrying about sustainability of Britain's peg to gold – run on sterling
# Britain's response
- British government tried similar tactics as Austria:
- Asked for loans from other countries
- Raised interest rates
- But was overwhelmed by speculative attack and suspended convertibility on September 19 1931
# The Sterling Crisis
- The fact that Britain went off gold in the fall of 1931 was a watershed moment
- British Treasury official is taking a bath
- Aid bursts in and says:
"We're off the gold standard"
- Astonished official says:
"I did not think that was possible."
# Crisis Spreads to U.S.
- After Britain fell, speculators began worrying that the U.S. might also leave the gold standard.
- Run on the U.S. dollar
Fed reacted by raising interest rates sharply
- This "worked." The speculative attack subsided
- However, consequences for economy were (arguably) dire
# Speculative Attacks
- Sterling crisis illustrates that gold standard is a system of fixed exchange rates
- Countries with a fixed exchange rate are subject to speculative attacks
- Speculative attacks can be self-fulfilling for similar (but slightly more involved) reasons as bank runs can be
# More Game Theory
- To understand this better, it is helpful to introduce a few more concepts from game theory
- We look at dynamic games
- Define a precise notion of credibility
# Dynamic Games
- How do we solve this game?
- Backward-induction:
- Begin at the "end" of the game and work backward
- Stage 3:
— Player 1 (P1) prefers L"
- Stage 2:
- P2 knows P1 will play L"
- So, P2 plays L'
State 1:
- P1 knows P2 will play L'
- So, P1 plays L

# Currency Attack Model
- Two investors who act simultaneously
- Bubble around Investor B is meant to denote that they doesn't know at which node they are
- This means they must do the same thing at both nodes
- Government acts last and knows at which node it is when it acts.
- It can therefore act differently at different nodes
- Government's strategy is four actions (one for each node)
# Currency Attack Model
- Let's solve for subgame perfect equilibria by backward induction
- Optimal government action is:
- Devalue if either A or B run (and also if they both do)
- Defend if neither A nor B runs
- Given this strategy by government, model simplifies to …
# Currency Attack Model

# Currency Attack Model
- This simplified model is equivalent to Diamond-Dybvig bank run model
- Model has two Nash equilibria:
- (Don't Run, Don't Run)
- (Run, Run)
- Just like in bank run case, (Run, Run) equilibrium is bad for everyone, but is nevertheless an equilibrium
# Currency Attack Model
- How can this outcome be avoided?
- Government can try to convince speculators that it is strong and can defend the currency
- Consider the following alternative situation in which the government is either:
- "Strong" in the sense of being able to defend at low cost (perhaps because it has lots of reserves)
- Places high value on maintaining the gold standard

# Currency Attack Model
- Only change is that it is less costly for government to defend against a "small" run
- New optimal government strategy:
- Default if both A and B run
- Defend otherwise
- Given this strategy by government, model simplifies to …

Investors
# Currency Attack Model
- This version has a single Nash equilibrium: – (Don't Run, Don't Run)
It is actually a dominant strategy for both investors not to run
- Each investor knows that the government is "strong" enough to withstand the other running
- So, each one doesn't have to run only because the other is running
# Speculative Attacks
- Countries on a fixed exchange rate can face speculative attacks
- This happened to many countries in the Great Depression
- Has happened frequently in the last 50 years
- E.g., UK 1992, Mexico 1994, Thailand 1997, Argentina 2001, etc.
# Value of Maintaining Fixed Rate
- Value of maintaining a fixed rate is unclear
- In most cases, there is short term pain:
- High interest rates
-A recession
- But then there may be longer term gains:
- Investors more willing to invest in the country because they are confident currency will not lose value
- Lower interest rates
- Hard to value long term gains
# Will Government Defend?
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/7437869714ddeca06d73bf0d3ddb2b8f623de89ebfb8f37971c014de1081cad1.jpg)
Uncertainty about government "strength"
# Speculation and Credibility
- If a fixed exchange rate has high credibility, speculators will act to stabilize exchange rate
- Suppose exchange rate falls a bit for some reason
- Speculators, expecting that it will rise back, see this as an opportunity to buy currency
- Thus speculators help currency move back to fixed rate (central bank needs not do much since speculators do all the heavy lifting)
# Speculation and Credibility
- However, if a fixed exchange rate has low credibility, speculators will act to destabilize exchange rate
- Suppose exchange rate falls a bit for some reason
- Speculators will see this as a sign of weakness and perhaps start expecting further decline
- They will thus sell the currency contributing to the further decline
- In this case, central bank must do a lot more trading to maintain fixed rate (perhaps more than it can or is willing to do)
# Gold Standard and Credibility
- Argument for going back on gold today: Gold standard would take away ability of Fed/Treasury to create inflation
- Is this convincing?
- Only if we can credibly commit not to go off the gold standard when things get tough
- Not clear that this is possible
- What would prevent us from going off gold again when things are tough?
# Gold Standard and Credibility
Classical gold standard worked well because it was very credible
- Overwhelming political support
- Devaluing unthinkable
- Interwar gold standard much weaker
- Less political support due to rise of left wing politics
Post WWII fixed exchange rates unstable:
- Bretton Woods, ERM crisis of 1992, Asian financial crisis of 1997-8, Mexican Tequila crisis of 1994-5, Argentina 2001-2, etc., etc.
# Fixed Exchange Rate and Credibility
- Ex ante:
- Want to commit to maintain fixed rate even in bad times. Why?
- This lowers expected inflation and thereby interest rates. (Italy back in 1990's)
- Country more desirable destination for investment.
- Ex post (e.g., recession, gov. debt crisis):
- Want to renege and devalue. Why?
- This creates inflation and thereby lowers real wages (increases competitiveness) and real value of debts (Greece/Italy/Spain/Portugal around 2012)

# The Phillips Curve
- A note on language: "Phillips curve", "Price setting equation", "short run aggregate supply curve" are all the same thing
- Phillips curve in medieval economy model:
$$
\pi_{t} = \theta \tilde {Y}_{t - 1} \quad \mathrm{or} \quad \pi_{t} = - 2 \theta (u_{t - 1} - u^{n})
$$
- Phillips curve of this form was "discovered" by A.W. Phillips in 1958 and popularized in U.S. by Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow in 1960

# Phillips Curve and Monetary Policy
- Phillips Curve: Negative relationship between inflation and unemployment
- Suggests that:
- We can engineer a lower unemployment rate if we are willing to tolerate higher inflation
What is optimal policy?
- Depends on:
- Relative cost of unemployment and inflation
- Slope of Phillips curve (how much  $\pi$  for given  $u$ )
# U.S. in the 1960's
- "Guns and butter":
- Vietnam war and Great Society
- Inflation rose
- Many argued:
- Low price to pay for lower unemployment
- Phillips curve thinking had major influence on policy
# U.S. in the 1960's

# Price Setting
- Does the long run Phillips curve in the Medieval model make sense?
- Idea behind price setting equation:
– Shop keeper wants to work a certain amount
(natural rate of output/unemployment)
- If demand is too high on a particular day, she raises her price for the next day
- Worked well in middle ages model with stable price level
- But now we are in a world with steady inflation
# Price Setting
- With steady positive inflation we can end up having a steady state positive output gap:
$$
\bar {\pi} = \theta \bar {\tilde {Y}}
$$
- Shop keeper always works more than she wants
She is making systematic mistakes:
- Always wrong in the same direction
- Each period she raises her price to compensate for rise in money supply since last period
- But she doesn't learn that there will be even more money in the economy next period since money supply is rising at a steady rate
— Behaves as though each period's increase in money supply is a "surprise"
# Price Setting

Abraham Lincoln:

"You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time."

- Medieval price setting equation violates this
- Not a very satisfying theory of price setting in an economy with steady non-zero inflation
# Expectation's Augmented Phillips Curve
- In 1968, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps independently argued:
- Phillips curve trade off will break down
- People will come to expect higher inflation and will take this into account when setting prices
- This will shift Phillips curve up if policy makers try to exploit it
# U.S. in 1960's

# Big Mistake
- Many economists in the 60's and 70's looked at the plots in Phillips' paper and believed in a permanent trade-off between inflation and output
- It turns out that they got things terribly wrong
- U.S. economy spiraled out of control
- They argued: Here is a correlation, let's exploit it!
- But they didn't understand the causation behind the correlation properly
- In this case, the correlation would break down when policymakers tried to exploit it because expectations changed
# Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve
- Friedman and Phelps' argument suggests the following modification to the price setting equation:
$$
\pi_{t} = E_{t - 1} \pi_{t} + \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
- $E_{t - 1}\pi_t$  denotes the expectation at time t-1 of inflation between time t-1 and time t
- New features:
- Expectations term
- Timing of output gap term (time t rather than t-1)
- Random "cost-push" (supply) shock
# Timing of Output Gap Term
- New expectations augmented Phillips curve involves output gap at time  $t$  rather than  $t - 1$
$$
\pi_{t} = E_{t - 1} \pi_{t} + \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
- This results from a model where
- Some prices are set one period in advance
- Some prices are perfectly flexible
- Price setters have rational expectations
- We skip this derivation (see Woodford, 2003, section 3.1.3)
# Jones' Notation Versus Our Notation

We use slightly different notation than Jones

- Jones defines:  $\pi_t = (P_{t+1} - P_t) / P_t$
We define:  $\pi_t = (P_t - P_{t-1}) / P_{t-1}$
- Jones is imprecise about the timing of expected inflation
- He denotes expected inflation by  $\pi_t^e$
- Not clear what time the expectation is taken and what inflation rate
- We use  $E_{t - 1}\pi_t$  instead.
(Alternative would be  $E_{t}\pi_{t + 1}$ . This alternative is also common.)
# Expectations Formation
- How do people form expectations?
- Assumption (Adaptive expectations):
Assume that people look at the past to form expectation:
$$
E_{t - 1} \pi_{t} = \pi_{t - 1}
$$

Alternative: Rational Expectations

- People form "model consistent" expectations
- Use all information available correctly
- Make no systematic mistakes
# Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve
- Expectations augmented Phillips curve:
$$
\pi_{t} = E_{t - 1} \pi_{t} + \bar {v} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
- Adaptive expectations:  $E_{t - 1}\pi_t = \pi_{t - 1}$
Combining these yields:
$$
\pi_{t} = \pi_{t - 1} + \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
# Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve
- With adaptive expectations:
$$
\pi_{t} = \pi_{t - 1} + \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
- When output is above potential…
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} > 0 \qquad \pi_{t} > \pi_{t - 1}
$$

… inflation is rising.

- When output is below potential…
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} <   0 \qquad \pi_{t} <   \pi_{t - 1}
$$

… inflation is falling

# Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve
$$
\pi_{t} = \pi_{t - 1} - 2 \bar {v} (u_{t} - u^{n}) + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
- When  $u_{t}< u^{n}$

# Expectations Augmented Phillips Curve
- Ignore supply shocks:
$$
\pi_{t} = \pi_{t - 1} + \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$

In this case, the Phillips curve crosses  $\tilde{Y}_t = 0$  at  $\pi_{t-1}$  (or equivalently  $u_t = u_t^n$ )

- That tells you how far it will shift if  $u_{t} \neq u_{t}^{n}$
- Why? Next period's Phillips curve will cross  $u_{t} = u_{t}^{n}$  at this period's inflation rate

# The NAIRU
- An alternative term for the "natural rate" of unemployment is the "NAIRU"
- "Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment"
- Rate of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation
- This concept captures the fact that:
- Inflation rises when unemployment is below the NAIRU or natural rate
- Inflation falls when unemployment is above the NAIRU or natural rate
- Strictly speaking it should be NIIRU or "nonincreasing inflation rate of unemployment"

Output gap

Volcker raised interest rates massively. This led to a deep recession. Inflation came down relatively quickly. Output was then allowed to rise back to potential.

# The Sacrifice Ratio
- Sacrifice ratio: Percentage of a year's real GDP foregone to permanently reduce inflation by one percentage point
- In the late 1970's economists believed that sacrifice ratio was high
  - Okun (1978) predicted a sacrifice ratio of 10!
  - i.e., to bring inflation down from  $12\%$  to  $2\%$  would entail a loss of an entire year's worth of output!
- Led many economists to be skeptical that it was worth the cost to bring down inflation
# Rational Expectations Revolution
- Thomas Sargent challenged this idea
- In a famous article titled "The End of Four Big Inflations"
- Pointed out that:
- In hyperinflations, inflation is  $1,000 \text{‰}$ per year (e.g., roughly  $25,000 \%$ in Germany in late 1923)
— Hyperinflations always end abruptly! (in late November 1923 in German case)

Fig. 2.4 Wholesale prices in Germany.
# Sacrifice Ratio
- Hyperinflations always end abruptly
- Inflation goes from  $1,000 \text{‰}$ to  $0 \%$ overnight
- If sacrifice ratio is 10, cost should be  $10,000 \text{‰}$  of output
- In fact, costs are close to zero (perhaps even negative, i.e., net benefits)
- How can this be?
# Credible Announcements
- Sacrifice ratio is not some fundamental unchangeable feature of reality
- Its size depends on how the government goes about reducing inflation
- If the government is able to make a credible commitment to dramatically lower inflation:
- Inflationary expectations will fall rapidly
- Phillips curve will shift down rapidly
- Sacrifice ratio will be small
# The Role of Expectations
- General model of inflation:
$$
\pi_{t} = E_{t - 1} \pi_{t} + \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {\sigma}_{t}
$$
- Two ways to lower inflation:
- Negative output gap
- Reduce expected inflation
- Expectations:
-In normal time we assume  $E_{t - 1}\pi_t = \pi_{t - 1}$
- But credible announcements may lead to deviations from this (i.e., may lead expectations to fall much faster)
# Sargent's Argument
- To bring down inflation at low cost, the Fed should:
- Make a clear commitment to low inflation
- Act decisively to convince the public that they were serious about bringing down inflation
- Easier said than done given low credibility of Fed after many failed attempts to lower inflation in the 1970s
- But this is what Volcker did
# My Research on the Phillips Curve
- Hazell, Herreno, Nakamura, Steinsson (2020):
- 1/3 of fall in inflation during Volcker disinflation due to negative output gap
- 2/3 of fall in inflation during Volcker disinflation due to shifts in inflationary expectations
# Volcker Disinflation (1980-84)
- Historical estimate of sacrifice ratio for U.S.  $\approx$  2.4
- 1 percentage point drop in inflation costs  $2.4\%$  of one year's GDP (could be spread out over time)
- Reduced inflation from  $\approx 12.1\%$  to  $3.3\%$  (8.8 pct points)
- Caused severe recession (unemployment up to 9.5\%)
Total output loss estimated  $\approx$  16\% of a year's GDP
- Sacrifice ratio for that episode = 16/8.8 = 1.8

# Hyperinflation
- Common definition: >500\% per year
Examples:
- France during Revolution
- Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland after WWI
- China in 1948-49
- Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia in 1980's
-Zimbabwe in 2007-09
- Venezuela in 2016-22
# Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy
- "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" (M. Friedman)
$$
M_{t} \bar {V} = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- High inflation is always and everywhere a fiscal phenomenon (attributed to T. Sargent)
$$
G_{t} = T_{t} + \Delta M_{t}
$$
# Cause of Inflation
- Money creation is proximate cause of inflation
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} = \Delta \log P_{t} + \Delta \log Y_{t} - \Delta \log V_{t}
$$
- But what is it that causes money creation?
- When money creation is extreme, it is often (always?) caused by fiscal pressures
$$
G_{t} = T_{t} + \Delta M_{t}
$$
- In that sense high inflation is a fiscal phenomenon
# Do Bonds Help?
- Two period world
- Government can issue bonds in first period
$$
G_{1} = T_{1} + B_{1} + \Delta M_{1}
$$
- Has to pay them in the second period
$$
G_{2} + (1 + r) B_{1} = T_{2} + \Delta M_{2}
$$
- Government's intertemporal budget constraint:
$$
G_{1} + \frac{G_{2}}{1 + r} = T_{1} + \frac{T_{2}}{1 + r} + \Delta M_{1} + \frac{\Delta M_{2}}{1 + r}
$$
# Do Bonds Help?
- Even if governments can issue bonds in the short run, there are ultimately only two ways to pay for its spending:
- Levy taxes
- Print money
- But in the real world, there is always another period. Why can't the government keep rolling over (ever increasing amounts of) debt?
- Who is going to want to hold all this debt?
- Eventually government can't find buyers for all of it
- At that point, game is up (problem set 6)
# How Do Hyperinflations End?

What kind of policy is best in a hyperinflation:

- Gradual reduction of the inflation?
- Shock therapy (attempt at abrupt end)?
- Why does shock therapy make sense?
— Rapidly change people's expectations
- Avoid prolonged recession
- In theory, if policy is perfectly credible and highly salient to everyone, everyone will stop raising prices immediately
- In fact, this seems to be what happens
# Shock Therapy
- What does the shock therapy consist of?
- Crucial element: Fiscal reform
- Root cause more spending than tax collection
- How is it done?
- Different in different cases
- Sometimes involves institutional change that insulates central bank from political pressure (bars govnm from "borrowing" from central bank)
- This forces government to cut spending or raise revenue
# Bolivian Hyperinflation
- Inflation was really high:
- Aug-84 to Aug-85: 20,000 \%
- Peaked at  $60,000\%$  per year towards end
- Ended abruptly:
- Comprehensive stabilization plan on Aug 29 1985
- Within 10 days inflation was gone http://www.udape.gov.bo

# Bolivia: Why did it happen?
- 1978-1985: Great deal of political instability – Coups, electoral stalemates, etc.
- 1980 onward: Adverse external shocks
- High world interest rates (Bolivia had borrowed a lot in the 1970's)
- Falling prices for Bolivia's exports
1982-1985: Weak government – Unable to balance the budget due to social and political pressures
# Jeffrey Sachs to the Rescue
- August 1985: New government
- They hire Jeffrey Sachs to advise them
- Sachs recommendation:
- "Shock therapy": End the hyperinflation all at once
- "No hyperinflation had ever been stopped [gradually]"
- Key: Raise the price of oil!!
- Hmmm … stop a hyperinflation by raising a price?!?
- Does this make sense?
# Jeffrey Sachs to the Rescue
- Government revenues depended heavily on oil taxes from state oil company
- State oil company set oil prices in pesos and changed them only every few months
- In between price changes, foreign currency price of oil plummeted destroying the budget
- Gas price in Bolivia in Aug-85: 0.03 per liter
- World gas price in Aug-85: 0.28 per liter

$$
\Delta \log M_{t} - \pi_{t} = - \phi i_{t} + \phi i_{t - 1} + \tilde {Y}_{t} - \tilde {Y}_{t - 1} + \Delta \log v_{t}
$$

Money Market (LM Curve):

- Goods Market (IS Curve):  $\tilde{Y}_{t} = \bar{a} -\bar{b}\left(R_{t} - \bar{r}\right)$
- Phillips curve:  $\pi_{t} = \pi_{t - 1} + \bar{v}\tilde{Y}_{t} + \bar{o}_{t}$
Fisher Equation:  $R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t}\pi_{t + 1}$
- Okun's Law:  $u_{t} - u^{n} = -\frac{1}{2} Y_{t}$
- Next: "Modernize" monetary policy
# Monetary Policy
- In medieval economy, monetary "shocks" create inefficient booms and busts
- Example:
$$
\begin{array}{l} -25 \% \text{oftime:}\Delta \log M_{t} = 1\% \\ -50 \% \text{oftime:}\Delta \log M_{t} = 3 \% \\ -25 \% \text{oftime:}\Delta \log M_{t} = 5 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

What do people expect?

What happens when  $\Delta \log M_{t} = 5 \%$  ?

What happens on average?

# Optimal Monetary Policy
- Monetary authority can't systematically fool people  $\Rightarrow$  can't systematically lower unemployment
- Random variation in money reduces welfare
What is optimal monetary policy?
- Can't possibly be to create inefficient fluctuations
- Milton Friedman: "Monetarism"
- Fed should conduct policy such that money growth is constant (i.e. eliminate any monetary surprises)
- Set money growth rate to be consistent with stable prices
# Monetarism
- Starting point:
$$
\log M_{t} + \log V_{t} = \log P_{t} + \log Y_{t}
$$
$$
\Delta \log M_{t} + \Delta \log V_{t} = \pi_{t} + \Delta \log Y_{t}
$$

Here we allow for changing velocity of money

- Friedman argued  $\Delta \log V_{t}$  was close to constant
- Suppose we want  $\pi_{t} = 0$  (stable prices)
- Good policy:  $\Delta \log M_{t} = -\Delta \log V_{t} + \Delta \log Y_{t}$  (actually  $\Delta \log \bar{Y}_{t}$ )

# Money Demand Shocks
- Suppose central bank fixes the money supply (or money growth)
- Money demand shocks will affect output and inflation
- Increase in money demand shifts LM curve back
- Decrease in money demand shifts LM curve down
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/bd168df3d4066429a7584c6eada4078b4fd1e60eac4d76bcc812f2a4e34e5cad.jpg)
# Money Demand Shocks
- Makes no sense to have money demand shocks affect output and inflation
- Good monetary policy should
- "Accommodate" money demand shocks
- Vary money supply to completely offset changes in money demand
- Doing this will insulate economy from money demand shocks
# Money Demand Shocks
$$
\log M_{t} - \log P_{t} = - \phi i_{t} + \log Y_{t} + v_{t}
$$
- Suppose central bank fully accommodates money demand shocks (varies money supply one-for-one with money demand shocks)
What does this imply about the interest rate?
- Nominal interest rate remains fixed!
- A policy of varying money supply so as to keep nominal interest rate fixed will fully insulate economy from money demand shocks
# Monetary Policy

What does it mean for monetary policy to "do nothing"?

- Traditional view: Not change the money supply (or money growth rate)
Alternative view: Maintain a fixed value of the nominal interest rate
- i.e., vary money supply in response to variation in money demand such that nominal interest rate is fixed
# Monetary Policy
- Central Bank can choose the money supply to achieve any nominal interest rate it wants
- We can think of the Central Bank as directly choosing the nominal interest rate
- In the real world monetary policy is actually conducted in this way:
- Federal Reserve thinks of its policy variable as the Federal Funds Rate (the over-night nominal interest rate on the interbank market)
- European Central Bank thinks of its policy variable as the rate on one week repurchase agreements
# Federal Funds Rate Target

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/32256522bce6591e2e62b280ee616e1668551d13dc4653a658ab13dfe11c46a2.jpg)

# FOMC
- Federal Open Market Committee of Federal Reserve sets monetary policy in the United States
- 7 Governors + 12 Presidents of Regional Feds (only 5 Presidents vote at each time)
- 8 scheduled meeting per year
- Sometimes unscheduled meeting (e.g., in crisis)
- Set target range for federal funds rate and interest on reserves
- Make statement about future course of economy and monetary policy (forward guidance)
# Open Market Operations
- How does the Federal Reserve go about setting the federal funds rate?
Traditionally, it would conduct "open market operations"
- If it wished to increase the fed funds rate it would sell Treasury bills on the "open market" in exchange for money
- This would reduce the amount of money in circulation and increase the interest rate
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/cdddf7d63f77c175c767a21eedc7ab5b31793878775123a613e3b8a6fb6cb16d.jpg)
# Interest on Reserves
- Since 2008, the Fed has paid interest on bank reserves
- Fed floods the system with reserves (i.e., banks have more reserves than they want)
- Banks are thus forced to hold excess reserves at the Fed
- Interest on reserves then determines interest rate on safe, short-term assets in the economy (Why?)
# Determination of Interest Rates
- Two assets banks can hold:
- Reserves
— Treasury bills
- Both safe and short term
- Must pay (roughly) the same return
— Suppose Treasuries paid a higher interest rate
- Everyone would want them rather than reserves
– This would bid up their price and thereby bid down their return
- Slight difference in returns can arise due to differences in liquidity
# Monetary Policy
# - Bottom line:
- When thinking about the modern conduct of monetary policy, we ignore the money market and just assume that the Central Bank sets the nominal interest rate directly
# The MP Curve
- With adaptive expectations:
$$
R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1} \rightarrow R_{t} = i_{t} - \pi_{t}
$$
- Prices (and inflation) are "sticky" in our model
- Prices partially set in advance
- Inflation sluggish in the short run (usually)
- Changing the nominal interest rate thus changes the real interest rate
- We can think of the central bank as effectively "setting" the real interest rate
# The MP Curve
- We think of central bank as setting real interest rate
- A horizontal line in "real interest rate –output gap" space
We call this curve the MP curve (stands for monetary policy)
- Replaces the LM curve

Affects Inflation

(and shifts next period Phillips curve)

# Optimal Monetary Policy
- Friedman's View/Neo-Classical View:
- Avoid destabilizing surprises
- All monetary policy can hope to do is avoid creating inefficient instability
Keynesian view:
- Monetary policy can do more!!
- Monetary policy should actively "undo" other shocks
- Money demand shocks, "aggregate demand shocks", shocks to expectations about the future (animal spirits)
- Monetary policy should aim to stabilize economy

AS: Aggregate Supply (Phillips Curve)

In response to supply shock, monetary policy faces a trade-off: Either high inflation (point A) or

a recession (point B)

# Optimal Stabilization Policy
- Demand shocks:
- Offset aggressively
- No trade-off between output and inflation stabilization
Supply shocks:
- Less clear. May want to act less aggressively ("look through") (Why?)
- Because there is a trade-off between output and inflation stabilization.
- Optimal reaction depends on weight placed different objectives
- Optimal reaction also depends on degree of anchoring of inflation expectations
# Goals of Monetary Policy

U.S.: Dual mandate:

- Maximum employment
- Stable prices
- ECB: Stable prices primary objective
# Goals of Monetary Policy
# U.S. Federal Reserve:

"(…) maintain long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long term interest rates."

Humphrey-Hawkins Act (1978)

# European Central Bank:

"… the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability …"

(Year-on-year increase in the harmonized index of consumer prices of below  $2 \%$ for the euro area as a whole)

"Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, it shall support the general economic policies in the Community…"

# Goals of Monetary Policy
- Why such an emphasis on stable prices?
What are the costs of inflation?
# What Are the Costs of Inflation?

Typical Layman's view:

- "Rising prices mean that I can buy less and less stuff…. Inflation is making me poorer."
- What is wrong with this argument?
- Wages also go up
- "Every year I get a raise, but prices go up and that takes some of my raise away."
- Implicit assumption: Would get same raise even if there was no inflation
# Money Illusion

Money Illusion:

- Tendency of individuals to pay primary attention to nominal prices rather than real prices
- Notion that inflation affects real wages and real prices
Most people:
- Sell very few goods. Acutely aware of price (wage).
- Regard rise in them as just reward as opposed to part of general inflation of prices and wages
# Costs of Inflation
- Most people believe costs of inflation are large
- Many economists believe costs of moderate inflation are small (although views differ quite a bit)
Shiller (1997) survey:
- "biggest gripe about inflation" was "inflation hurts my real buying power, it makes me poorer"
- $77 \%$ of public agrees
- $12 \%$  of economists agree
# Costs of Inflation
# Shiller (1997) survey:
- "Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority, as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools – 52\% of public but 18\% of economists agree fully
- "I think that if my pay went up I would feel more satisfaction in my job, more sense of fulfillment, even if prices went up just as much." – 49\% of public but 8\% of economists agree fully or partially
# Cost of Expected Inflation
- Say every year the price level rose by  $10 \%$  (expected and stable)
- People will incorporate expected inflation into contracts they right
- Interest rates will reflect expected inflation
- Wage contracts and wage negotiations will reflect expected inflation
- So, perhaps this is just a wash?
# Cost of Expected Inflation

What are the costs of steady expected inflation?

1. Real value of money falling. People economize on money holdings. Need to make more trips to the ATM ("Shoe leather costs")
2. Firms must change their price tags and menus more often (Menu costs). Pay more attention to prices.
3. If prices and wages are sticky, relative prices (and wages) get out of whack. Relative prices/wages fall between changes.
4. Many provisions of tax law ignore inflation. (e.g., capital gains tax and interest deductions)
5. Some people's wages will fall (if they were "too high" to begin with, e.g., because their productivity or effort had fallen). (Individual cost, not societal cost)
# Cost of Expected Inflation
- Many economists are skeptical that it is possible to have moderate inflation that is stable
- Friedman: "Zero inflation is a politically feasible objective; 10 percent inflation is not. That is the verdict of history."
- High inflation has tended to be volatile
- But is this a law of nature or simply because high inflation periods have been associated with wars and bad economic policies
# Costs of Unexpected Inflation
1. Uncertainty makes financial planning difficult
2. Real value of nominal contracts becomes risky
3. Could write contracts in real terms (index the payments to inflation). This is costly.
4. People are risk averse and dislike uncertainty
5. Redistributes wealth arbitrarily
# Inflation and Wealth Redistribution
- Many contracts specify nominal payments
- Inflation affects real value of these payments
Bonds:
– Promise to pay 1 in a year
- How much is this worth in terms of "stuff"
- Redistribution:
- Those that own nominal assets (are "long" nominal assets) loose from inflation
- Those that owe nominal assets (are "short" nominal assets) gain from inflation

# Monetary Framework
- How should central banks go about attaining its goals?
- Frameworks tried in the past:
- Commodity standard (e.g., gold standard)
- Fixed exchange rate
- Monetarism
- By late 80's clear that all of these have significant downsides
- New idea: Inflation targeting
# Inflation Targeting
- Key idea: Vary interest rates so as to bring inflation to a pre-announced target level in the medium run
- Early inflation targeting countries: - New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Sweden
Now many, many countries practice inflation targeting
- Fed formally adopted a  $2 \%$ inflation target in 2012
# Inflation Targeting
- Goal to achieve stability (stable growth) of overall level of prices rather than one particular price (such as gold or foreign exchange)
- More flexible than gold standard or fixed exchange rate
- Only meant to be achieved over the medium term
- So, after a supply shock central bank can balance competing objectives (unemployment and inflation)
# Why Target  $2 \%$ Inflation?
- Most inflation targeting countries target  $2 \%$ inflation (or something close to that). Why?
1. Measures of inflation are likely biased upward by something like  $2 \%$
2. A little inflation gives more room to bring about negative real rates if needed without hitting zero lower bound on nominal interest rates (more on this below)
3. A little inflation may "grease the wheels of the labor market"
# Inflation Greases the Wheels of the Labor Market
- Suppose wages are downward rigid and inflation is zero
- Suppose, furthermore, that firms are overly optimistic and set wages too high (or economy hit by bad shock that requires wages to fall)
- Since wages can't fall, result will be unemployment
- Inflation would erode real wages and solve problem over time

# Inflation Bias of Monetary Policy
- Why was inflation high in the 1970s?
1. Mistaken belief that policy makers could exploit a permanent Phillips curve trade-off
2. Political pressure to create a short-term boom
- Suppose central bank creates surprise boom
Short term gain: boom
- Long term cost: Higher inflation forever
- Very tempting for politicians facing reelection
- Government may also want lower interest rates to reduce interest payments on government debt
# Government's Temptation
- Government faces following temptation:
- Create boom today (with loose monetary policy)
- Promise to maintain low inflation in the future
- If promise is believed
- inflationary expectations will not change
- Short term boom, but no shift in Phillips curve
- But is promise credible?
- No. Tomorrow, govt wants to do the same thing again
- So, government faces a commitment problem (aka a "time inconsistency problem")
# Overcoming Inflation Bias
- How do we overcome Government's commitment problem?
1. Policy "rules" to tie central bank's hands
2. Central bank independence
# Policy Rules
Examples of constraints on policy:
- Fixed exchange rate
- "Taylor rule" (discussed below)
- Limiting policy discretion was also an important motivation for inflation targeting
- Public target (embarrassing to miss it)
- Central bank must justify actions in terms of how they contribute to reaching target
- In some cases, if they miss, need to send report to Parliament
# Central Bank Independence
Politicians are "too" myopic because of reelection risk (care too much about short run)
- Role of the Fed: "Take the punch bowl away when the party is starting to heat up"
- Easier if monetary policy is:
- Isolated from political pressure
In the hands of technocrats that value good inflation outcomes ("conservative" central banker)

# The Taylor Rule
$$ i_{t} = 2 \% + \pi_{t} + 0.5 (\pi_{t} - 2 \%) + 0.5 \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$
Equal. real interest rate:  $2 \%$
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/996b89c7ec9d15967719e28606df480c4e8b7f356b2f1e041e1719743984cadd.jpg)
Target inflation rate:  $2\%$
# Example (Nov 2025):
- Inflation = 2.9\% (Core PCE y-o-y\%)
- Output gap = -0.6\% (based on Okun's law with  $u^{*} = 4.0\%$  and  $u = 4.3\%$ )
- Targeted interest rate:
$$ i = 2 \% + 2.9 \% + .5(0.9 \%) + .5(-0.6 \%) = 5.7 \%
$$
- Actual rate:  $4.00\%$  (upper limit of target range)
# The Taylor Rule
$$ i_{t} = 2 \% + \pi_{t} + 0.5 (\pi_{t} - 2 \%) + 0.5 \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$
John Taylor originally proposed this rule in a 1993 paper
- Showed impressive fit to the data over period 1987-1992
- Considered period of good policy

# The Taylor Rule
$$ i_{t} = 2 \% + \pi_{t} + 0.5 (\pi_{t} - 2 \%) + 0.5 \tilde {Y}_{t}
$$
- Key logic:
- Raise nominal rate more than one-for-one with inflation
- This raises the real rate when inflation rises
- Need to raise the real rate to tighten policy
- Also raises rates when output rises relative to potential

# Why the Huge Taylor Rule Deviation after Covid?
- Large shift in demand from goods to services.
- Acts like a shift in the Phillips curve
- Fed "looked through" this supply shock
- Inflation expectations were quite well anchored
Fed behind the curve

# The Taylor Rule
- Desirable properties
- Stabilizes the economy
- Balances inflation and unemployment costs
- Simple / Transparent
- But too rigid to be applied in practice?
- Does not incorporate information about which shocks are hitting economy
- Ignores problems at the zero lower bound
# Zero Lower Bound
- Standard monetary policy in a recession:
- Lower interest rates enough to bring about full employment
- Fall of 2008: Serious financial crisis and output falling rapidly
- On Dec. 16 2008, Fed lowered nominal interest rates to  $0 - 0.25\%$  (essentially zero)
- Similar situation in March of 2020 due to Covid
- Nominal interest rates can't go below zero (Why?)
# Zero Lower Bound
- Traditional argument:
- Money pays zero interest
- If interest rates are below zero, people will simply hold money (cash)
- So, interest rates can't go below zero
- But it is inconvenient/costly to hold actual cash
- Theft an important concern when amounts are large
- Need warehouse, security, etc.
- In practice, several European countries pushed rates below zero in 2010s
# Negative Rates in Europe/Japan
Denmark, ECB, Switzerland, Sweden, and Japan lowered policy rate to negative territory for several years
- Lowest rate: -0.75\%
- Perhaps there is an effective lower bound (ELB) at some rate
- We don't know how low rates can go

# MP Curve at Zero Lower Bound
- Suppose for simplicity that interest rates can't go below zero
- Central bank can no longer set  $R_{t}$  freely
- Need to be able to vary  $i_{t}$  in order to set  $R_{t}$
- When  $i_{t} = 0$  we have:
$$
\begin{array}{l} {R_{t}} = {i_{t} - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1}} \\ = - E_{t} \pi_{t + 1} \\ = - \pi_{t} \\ \end{array}
$$
- The low is inflation, the higher is the real interest rate
# MP Curve at Zero Lower Bound
- Phillips curve implies:
$$
R_{t} = - \pi_{t} = - \left(\pi_{t - 1} + \bar {v} \tilde {Y}_{t} + \bar {o}\right)
$$
Real rate is decreasing in the output gap
- The bigger the recession becomes, the larger the real interest rate becomes!!
- This is zero lower bound MP curve
# MP Curve at Zero Lower Bound
- IS Curve:
$$
\tilde {Y}_{t} = \bar {a} - \bar {b} (R_{t} - \bar {r})
$$
Zero Lower Bound MP Curve
$$
R_{t} = - \bar {\nu} \tilde {Y}_{t} - \pi_{t - 1} - \bar {\sigma}
$$
- Relative slope depends on  $\bar{b}$  and  $\bar{v}$
- Problem: ZLB MP curve cannot be shifted down!

# Policy Options at Zero Lower Bound
# 1. Quantitative Easing
- Normally Fed targets short term safe interest rate
- In crisis interest rate spreads between safe and less safe bonds rose
- Fed responded by purchasing riskier bonds to lower interest rates on these bonds (e.g., mortgage backed securities)
- Lower interest rates on mortgage backed securities lower interest rates on mortgages and thereby stimulate spending

# Huge Increase in Monetary Base
- Many people worried about inflation
$$
M_{t} V_{t} = P_{t} Y_{t}
$$
- Monetary base quadrupled, shouldn't this lead to huge amounts of inflation?
- Monetary economists were confident that this was NOT the case!

Monetary base = currency + bank reserves at Fed
M1 = currency + deposits
M2 = M1 + savings accounts
# Money in the Great Recession
- Huge increase in monetary base reflection of Fed large scale asset purchases
- Did not lead to increase in the money supply (M1, M2) (Why?)
— Banks happy to hold extra reserves at Fed
- Reserves very safe asset
- Interest rates on other safe assets close to zero. So why not?
- Reserves now pay interest (since 10/6/2008)
- Reserves no longer return dominated asset
# Value of Theory
- Huge increase in monetary base caused lots of confusion on the part of many people (lots of worries about high inflation)
- Monetary economists (including Bernanke) saw through this an kept their cool
# Policy Options at Zero Lower Bound
# 2. Forward Guidance
Statements about future path of policy
- Intended to lower longer term interest rates
Lower long rates  $\Rightarrow$  lower mortgage rates  $\Rightarrow$  higher spending
Fed statement in August 2011: Keep rates close to zero "at least through mid-2013"
Fed statement in January 2012: Keep rates close to zero "at least through late 2014"

# Policy Options at Zero Lower Bound
# 3. Raise inflation target
- Recall:  $R_{t} = i_{t} - E_{t}\pi_{t + 1}$
- Promising higher inflation reduces real rates, which stimulates spending
Are such promises credible?
- Not clear. When future comes, no longer optimal to carry through and have high inflation
- How can Fed go about convincing people that they are serious about this?
# Lecture 18:
# Fiscal Policy
Macroeconomics (Quantitative)
Economics 101B

University of California, Berkeley

# Fiscal Policy
- Main tools of stabilization policy:
- Monetary policy
- Fiscal policy
- Types of fiscal policy:
- Automatic stabilizers (e.g., unemployment insurance)
- Fiscal stimulus checks
- Countercyclical government spending (purchases)
# Stimulus Checks vs. Government Purchases
- Stimulus checks:
- Transfer from taxpayers to recipients
- What is MPC of recipients?
- Taxpayers may spend less
- Government purchases
- Government purchases goods and services
- No issue of MPC (government's "MPC" is 1 on these funds)
- Government purchases often referred to as government spending or fiscal stimulus
# Monetary Policy vs. Government Purchases
- Common view: Monetary policy is stabilization policy of choice during normal times.
- Central bank nimbler than Congress
- Less political
However: If monetary policy hits the ZLB, fiscal stimulus becomes more important
# Fiscal Stimulus in Keynesian Model
1. Base case: No monetary response, no hand-to-mouth consumers, no-ZLB
- IS curve:  $\tilde{Y}_t = \overline{a} -\overline{b} (R_t - \bar{r})$
G increases by  $1\%$  of GDP. How much does  $\tilde{Y}_t$  rise?
- By  $1\%$  ( $\overline{a}$  increases by  $1\%$ , no response of  $R_{t}$ )
- Fiscal multiplier equal to 1
- Fiscal multiplier is defined as the \% increase in output when government spending increases by 1\% of GDP (equivalent to dollar increase in GDP when G increases by 1)
# Fiscal Stimulus (Not ZLB)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-07/0ded8ea9-3111-494d-85a0-c86b834a70a6/0326e9ccccde54f4445a3a96cb82a09358ca89a6809af1c40c7886d1a42c8a4d.jpg)

FE: Full Employment

# Fiscal Stimulus in a Keynesian Model
# 2. What if monetary policy responds?
- If fiscal policy is expansionary, monetary policy need not be as expansionary.
- Monetary policy will systematically do less the more fiscal policy does (when not at ZLB)
- Fiscal stimulus will thus induce higher  $R_{t}$  than in counterfactual
- IS curve:  $\tilde{Y}_t = \bar{a} - \bar{b}(R_t - \bar{r})$
- $\Delta \bar{a} \uparrow$  but  $R_{t} \uparrow$  than otherwise
- Measured fiscal multiplier less than one (because of response of monetary authority)
# Fiscal Stimulus in Keynesian Model
3. Hand-to-mouth consumers (no MP response)
- IS curve:  $\tilde{Y}_t = \frac{1}{1 - \bar{x}}\left(\bar{a} - \bar{b}(R_t - \bar{r})\right)$
- What is fiscal multiplier?
- $\frac{1}{1 - \bar{x}} > 1$  (response to  $1\%$  increase in  $\bar{a}$ )
- Fiscal multiplier larger than 1
# Fiscal Stimulus in Keynesian Model
# 4. At Zero Lower Bound
- IS curve:  $\tilde{Y}_t = \bar{a} -\bar{b} (R_t - \bar{r})$
- MP curve:  $R_{t} = -\bar{v}\tilde{Y}_{t} - \pi_{t - 1} - \bar{o}$
— – Government raises spending by  $1\%$  of GDP
Higher output raises inflation => lowers real interest rate => raises output, etc.
- Virtuous spiral!
- Fiscal multiplier large than 1

Unemployment Rate With and Without the Recovery Plan
# Neo-Classical View of Fiscal Stimulus
- Government takes away people's stuff (i.e., taxes them to buy some of the output)
- People are poorer. What do they do?
- Consume less of goods
- And less of leisure (work more)
- Positive multiplier due to negative wealth effect
- Multiplier less than one since people don't increase effort enough to get to old level of consumption
# Neo-Classical View of Fiscal Stimulus
- Intuitively, government takes some stuff away from people
$$
C = Y - G
$$
- Several ways they can respond:
1. Increase Y (work more) to keep C constant
2. Decrease C to keep Y (and therefore L) constant
3. A little bit of both
- It is optimal to do a little bit of both
# Neo-Classical Fiscal Stimulus with Investment
- We have been ignoring investment
- In economy with investment, people have three options:
$$
C = Y - I - G
$$
- Consume less
- Work more
- Invest less
- Optimally, they do a little bit of each
- Government spending "crowds out" investment as well as consumption and leisure
# Fiscal Stimulus
- Basic (New) Keynesian with constant  $R_{t}$ : Multiplier = 1
- Keynesian with normal MP response: Multiplier  $< 1$
- Keynesian at ZLB: Multiplier  $>1$
Keynesian with hand-to-mouth: Multiplier  $>1$
- Neo-Classical:  $0 < \text{Multiplier} < 1$
# Fama (2009)

Identity:

$$
I = S_{H} + S_{c} + S_{g}
$$
- Investment must equal sum of household, corporate and government saving
- Fama argues: This implies fiscal stimulus can't work
- Logic:  $G \uparrow$  implies that  $S_{g} \downarrow$  implies that  $I \downarrow$
Is this true?
- No. Completely false. Makes no sense at all.
- If government demands more, this can lead people to produce more which can raise household savings
- Even if demand is not important (neoclassical model), wealth effects lead people to produce more
# Barro (2009)
- Skeptical that multiplier can be greater than one
- "In addition to the free airplane or bridge, we also have more goods and services left over to raise private consumption or investment"
- "If this mechanism is genuine, one might ask why the government should stop with only 1 trillion of added purchases"
- Responses: Long run versus short run / ZLB
# Fiscal Multiplier: Empirics
- How large is the fiscal multiplier?
- How can we tell empirically?
- Simple minded approach:
- Look at correlation between changes in spending and changes in GDP
- But a correlation is not the same as causation!
What are potential "confounding effects"?
- When economy is sagging (federal) government tries to stimulate economy with spending (downward bias)
- When economy is booming (state and local) governments spend more (upward bias)
# Natural Experiments: Wars
- Wars lead to large changes in gov. spending that are random from perspective of output
- Barro and Redlick (2011) use wars to estimate fiscal multiplier:
$$
\frac{Y_{t} - Y_{t - 1}}{Y_{t - 1}} = \alpha + \beta \frac{G_{t} - G_{t - 1}}{Y_{t - 1}} + \mathrm{ot he rv ar ia bl es} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$
- Where  $G_{t}$  is military spending

# Fiscal Multipliers in Wars
- War multiplier: 0.6-0.7
- Why might war multiplier be different from “fiscal stimulus” multipliers?
- Large wars feature “command-and-control”
- Rationing of consumer products (downward bias in multiplier)
- Patriotism / mandated production(upward bias in multiplier)
— Bottlenecks in large wars
# Regional Evidence on Fiscal Stimulus
- Major problems with war estimates:
- There are only so many wars! (imprecise estimates)
- Confounding effects: Patriotism, rationing, etc.
- US states have different amounts of military production
- Perhaps we can look at whether states with a lot of military production do better than states with little military production when there is a military buildup (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014)
# Regional Variation in Military Spending
- California much more sensitive to aggregate variation in military spending than Illinois
- We can ask, does GDP in CA rise relative to GDP in IL when US military spending increases

Notes: Each cell in the table reports results for a different regression with a shorthand for the main regressor of interest listed in the far left column. A shorthand for the dependent variable is stated at the top of each column. The dependent variable is a two-year change divided by the initial value in each case. Output and employment are per capita. The regressor is the two-year change divided by output. Military spending variables are per capita except in Population regression. Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions include region and time fixed effects, and are estimated by two-stage least squares. The sample period is 1966-2006 for output, employment, and population, and 1969-2006 for the CPI. Output is state GDP, first deflated by the national CPI and then by our state CPI measures. Employment is from the BLS payroll survey. The CPI measure is described in the text. Standard errors are clustered by state or region.
# Regional Variation in Military Spending
- We find a “relative multiplier” of 1.5
- i.e., when military spending goes up by  $1\%$  of GDP in CA relative to IL, output goes up by  $1.5\%$  in CA relative to IL
- But how do we interpret this?
- Not the same as aggregate multiplier
- No response of “relative” monetary policy or tax policy
- States don’t pay for spending
# Interpretation of Relative Multiplier
- Since relative monetary policy held fixed, relative multiplier is roughly analogous to aggregate multiplier for fixed  $R_{t}$
- Our results thus more consistent with Keynesian model with hand-to-mouth consumers than with Neoclassical model
- implies that aggregate multiplier is big at the zero lower bound
# Exploding Government Debt?
US government debt has risen rapidly as a fraction of GDP in recent years
- Almost as high as at the end of WWII
- Is this dangerous?

# Fiscal Space
- There is a limit to how much debt governments can issue
- At some point, markets will not buy more debt
- Because the don’t think the government will be able to repay
Fiscal space: Amount of debt a government can issue before hitting its “borrowing limit”
# Fiscal Space
- Hard to know how high the borrowing limit is
- Probably different for different countries
- “Screwed-up countries” often default when debt hits something like  $60\%$  of GDP
- “Advanced countries” can have debt of at least  $120\%$  of GDP without defaulting

# Fiscal Space and Fiscal Stimulus
- When crisis strikes, fiscal space determines how much fiscal stimulus country can do
- Say debt limit is  $120\%$  of GDP
- Country that starts with  $120\%$  of GDP in debt can’t do any fiscal stimulus (must actually do austerity if GDP falls)
- Country that starts with  $40\%$  of GDP in debt can do lots of fiscal stimulus
- Fiscal space is very valuable in a crisis!!
