# 2 Spending and the Cycle

This chapter evaluates how governments in Latin America and the Caribbean spend over the business cycle. Economists preach the importance of so-called countercyclical spending policies. According to basic Keynesian precepts, countercyclical spending involves spending less in good times (to cool off the economy and allow the government to increase its savings thanks to the greater fiscal revenue collected from a larger tax base) and expanding spending in bad times (to mitigate recession and speed up recovery). Naturally, countercyclical spending policies help stabilize output fluctuations. By contrast, procyclical spending policies, which increase spending in good times and cut it in bad times, tend to amplify output fluctuations, creating large social costs, especially affecting the most vulnerable segments of the population. Much like individuals and families, governments cannot continually increase spending in good times (as fiscal revenues increase) and further increase spending in bad times (to cope with recession) without jeopardizing the sustainability of sovereign debt.

While some developing countries have learned how to lean against the wind and follow countercyclical policies (as has been the historic norm in most industrial countries), about two-thirds of the developing world continues to engage in spending profligacy in good times and, consequently, is forced to cut spending in bad times.

While some developing countries have learned how to lean against the wind and follow countercyclical policies (as has been the historic norm in most industrial countries), about two-thirds of the developing world continues to engage in spending profligacy in good times and, consequently, is forced to cut spending in bad times. Complementing previous work on aggregate spending, this chapter ventures into the nature of spending policy within spending categories. This exercise exposes structural deficiencies, not only in actual spending, which in many developing countries (including Latin American and Caribbean countries) is procyclical and discretionary, but also in the design of automatic "de-stabilizers." Automatic de-stabilizers are nothing more than a lack of automatic stabilizers in the region (mainly the lack of unemployment insurance). More puzzling is the existence of perverse automatic de-stabilizing mechanisms (particularly due to the way individual social security benefits are indexed over time in several countries in the region). These factors, in turn, compromise the ability of countries to effectively stabilize spending policies and protect their most vulnerable citizens.

This chapter analyzes two key spending categories in particular: current and capital expenditures. Developing countries—including in Latin America—tend to increase current expenditures in good times. But spending on items such as education and health should be based solely on long-term trends. Countries then cut capital expenditures in bad times, when they should be expanded to sustain aggregate demand. This chapter unravels the differential impact of current versus capital spending on output, thereby providing evidence that the so-called capital expenditure multiplier is much larger than that of current expenditure. Thus, policies that cut capital expenditures in bad times are doubly wrong, not only because capital expenditure should expand in bad times, but also because capital expenditure has the largest multiplier effect on economic activity. In particular, public investment generates important output effects when public capital stocks are low, which is typically the case in most of the developing world. By contrast, in advanced economies, and even in parts of the developing world that enjoy appropriate levels of public capital stocks, increases in public investment have little effect on economic activity. Thus, not all types of capital expenditure are equal. In fact, inefficient spending results in no useful spending in practice. The size of spending multipliers increases when public spending is conducted in an efficient manner. By contrast, efforts to increase spending without institutional vigilance regarding efficiency may have no effect on economic activity.

## How Do Governments Spend over the Business Cycle?

Using spending data from the years 1980-2016, Figure 2.1 shows the correlation of the cyclical component of output and primary spending (i.e., excluding interest payments). The difference between advanced countries (blue bars) and developing countries (orange bars) is striking. A positive (negative) correlation indicates a procyclical (countercyclical) spending policy, as spending moves in the same (opposite) direction of output. Advanced economies have overwhelmingly followed countercyclical policies, with 80 percent of countries behaving countercyclically. On the contrary, developing countries (Latin American and Caribbean countries included), by and large, have typically pursued procyclical fiscal policies: 74 percent of countries have done so, for an average and statistically significant correlation of 0.35.

Why do governments and policymakers (especially in developing countries) follow procyclical fiscal policies? Traditional explanations center on two main arguments. The first points to political distortions and weak institutions. Policymakers' short-sightedness and political pressure to spend when resources are available, along with other political-economy-based reasons, encourage excessive public spending during boom periods. The inevitable consequence of these sprees is the need to cut spending in bad times.

The second argument emphasizes the effect of limited access to international credit markets, particularly in bad times. While several countries are isolated from international credit markets on a constant basis, most often, countries lose access to international credit markets or undergo high sovereign spreads in bad times because they have spent recklessly and become overly indebted during good times. Thus, most literature on the subject posits that spending procyclicality is the deliberate result of political economy drivers and weak institutions coupled with the absence of enforceable rules to help contain the so-called voracity effect during good times.

As a consequence of improvements in fiscal management, since the mid-1990s/early 2000s, about a third of developing countries have been able to "graduate" (to borrow a term used by Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin, 2013) from procyclical spending policy. After the year 2000, a significant number of developing countries shifted from procyclicality to countercyclicality (Figure 2.2). The first Latin American and Caribbean country to "graduate" was Chile, in the early 1990s. While far from a knock-out victory against the procyclicality trap, this nevertheless remarkable structural policy shift among a significant number of developing countries was supported by (i) better institutional quality and technocrats who knew to save during boom periods (or at the very least reduce overspending) (ii) more central bank independence, which reduced monetization expectations, inducing more fiscal prudence in good times and the buildup of large cushions of foreign reserves, (iii) the implementation of fiscal rules that, while not a panacea, helped articulate the rules of the game within the public sector, supporting a more sustainable fiscal framework (see Chapter 9 on the importance of so-called second-condition fiscal rules), and (iv) the creation of sovereign wealth funds to help save and diversify investment associated with massive commodity revenues during boom periods, especially in commodity-rich countries.<sup>1</sup>

## Automatic Spending for Stabilization (or De-stabilization!)

The above discussion may suggest that spending policy over the business cycle is essentially the result of discretionary spending (i.e., policymakers making deliberate decisions as to whether to engage in spending expansions or cuts). True, most public spending is, in essence, discretionary. In fact, public consumption (i.e., wages and salaries, and goods and services) and public investment are, for the most part, the result of policymakers' deliberate spending decisions when approving the budget. Public consumption and investment involve around 75 and 60 percent of primary spending in developing and industrial countries, respectively. Arguably, especially in the case of wages and salaries, these expenditure items may be quite rigid or difficult to change in the short term for political economy reasons. Yet, intrinsically, this type of spending is inherently discretionary in nature. Figure 2.3 shows, like Figure 2.1, the degree of cyclicity in spending, this time focusing solely on discretionary spending (proxied by the sum of public consumption and public investment). The developing world shows strong procyclical discretionary spending, with 83 percent of countries behaving pro-cyclically, and a correlation of 0.36 (virtually identical to that estimated for total primary spending in Figure 2.1). Interestingly, the overwhelmingly countercyclical profile depicted by advanced economies in Figure 2.1 (i.e., when focusing on total primary spending) is largely diluted and, on average, becomes a-cyclical. The same is true if public consumption and public investment are analyzed separately.[2]

What happens to that portion of total primary spending that is not discretionary? In other words, what happens to automatic spending over the cycle?

About 25 and 40 percent of primary spending in developing and industrial countries, respectively, is not directly related to policymakers' deliberate/ discretionary spending decisions; instead, it is the result of implementing social programs and benefits that are automatic in nature. Automatic spending, in most cases money transfers to individuals or households, involves the disbursement of public funds resulting from laws (or even constitutions) benefiting people who meet certain criteria. The specific criteria depend upon the nature of the social programs and benefits which, in turn, is also shaped

by countries' most pressing social challenges. The most important automatic spending categories include (i) social security (mainly transfers to individuals after their retirement), (ii) family programs and benefits, which include conditional cash transfers mainly to the poor and most vulnerable households, and (iii) unemployment insurance (transfers to unemployed individuals).

about 80 percent of the main social transfer programs and benefits in seven Latin American and Caribbean countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay), Izquierdo, Puig, et al. (2018a) uncover this puzzle and propose policy recommendations to solve it.<sup>5</sup> To contrast the pros and cons of stabilization properties (or lack thereof), spending data from several countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States) were also used.<sup>6</sup> Data from the seven Latin American countries are matched with the criteria used to categorize programs in the OECD (i.e., family programs and benefits, unemployment insurance, and social security).

Total spending on social transfers as a share of GDP averages 15 percent of GDP in both the Latin America and the Caribbean and the industrial countries samples. In line with the expected degree of cyclicality, both samples show, typically, a-cyclicality in family programs and benefits spending (see Figure 2.6). In fact, unemployment insurance spending is, by and large, countercyclical (see Figure 2.7). Interestingly, especially in the cases of Argentina and Uruguay, social security spending is procyclic (see Figure 2.8). Why does social security spending increase in good times and fall in bad times? The answer lies in the perverse way social

security benefits are indexed over time in several countries in the region. Most industrial and many developing countries have formulas that index social security benefits to inflation; after all, the purchasing power of retirees should ideally be preserved over time. Unfortunately, as of end 2017, that was not the case for the prevailing social security systems in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.<sup>7</sup> In 2008, Argentina changed the formula used to index social security benefits from discretionary criteria (which in and of itself is not good as it requires discretionary policy to amend social security benefits) to a formula using both fiscal revenues and wages, which are both typically procyclical elements that do not guarantee the preservation of retiree's purchasing power.<sup>8</sup> Similarly, Brazil since 2011 uses both inflation and output growth and Uruguay since 2003 uses wages as inputs for updates in social security benefits.

Figure 2.9 dives deeper into the effect of these social security reforms by calculating the degree of procyclicality before and after the reforms. Indeed, before these reforms, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay had a-cyclical

## Solving the Puzzle

## Capital vs. Current Expenditures

## Spending Policy and the Macroeconomy

Thus far the focus has been on how fiscal policy behaves over the business cycle. But there is another side to this coin: what is the effect of spending

Figure 2.14 Multiplier of Total Primary Spending on Output  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/039d4ff1-8da6-4c4c-9fe7-0e1baa9d2e55/87dafe5c4941926388b394003e38ee57c440f09bee1bb7f5ed76b532d42f185d.jpg)

policy on the macroeconomy? The so-called spending multiplier measures just that: the effect of spending on economic activity. Understanding the size of this multiplier is important when analyzing the ability of public expenditure to affect the business cycle.

Figure 2.14 shows the cumulative effect of primary spending on output. Findings point to a lower than unit medium term spending multiplier. In other words, a  \$1 increase in government spending leads to less than a\$ 1 increase in output. Why? Economists point to the crowding out effect. In other words, the direct positive effect of higher spending on output is more than compensated by a reduction in some other macroeconomic aggregate such as private consumption. For example, if people expected higher taxes to come after an increase in spending or lower private investment if interest rates rise as a consequence of greater public spending.

So far little has been said about the impact of different types of spending on output. Interestingly, splitting the effects of spending on output into the effect derived from current spending (mainly driven by public consumption) and that from public investment generates quite different results. Figure 2.15 shows that the overall low spending multiplier obtained before is the result of current spending (see Panel A) and not that of capital spending (see Panel B), which is much larger and closer to one. This systematic finding underlies a recent trend favoring public investment as a strategy to foster economic activity. The complementarity between public investment and private investment is behind these results. For this reason, it is not surprising that public investment has become "fashionable" as a means to boost resilience to adverse global conditions and foster

economic activity. From northern Europe to the least developing countries, policy circles are starting to embrace a public investment agenda.

## When Public Investment Counts Most

## Better than Nothing? Not When It Comes to Inefficient Spending

## Putting It All Together

Dealing with the cycle is not easy. Latin America has only a very few graduates when it comes to good management of counter-cyclical policies. This is partly due to the dubious design of some transfer programs, particularly social security expenditure. Moreover, although the region has properly dealt with transfer programs designed to take new generations out of poverty, little has been done to correct unemployment insurance programs, indeed a key instrument to deal with cycles for those that need them the most.

Latin America has yet to set up programs to deal with the management of current and capital expenditures along the cycle. Most countries in the region save too little in good times—even increasing current expenditure above trend in good times—and use mostly capital expenditures to adjust in bad times. This policy has several faults: countries should follow expansionary expenditure policies in bad times instead of cutting them,

and that expansionary policy should be carried out with capital expenditure, whose multipliers are larger than those of current expenditures. Otherwise, countries are shooting themselves in the foot twice: first, they are following contractionary policies in bad times, and second, when they expand they are focusing on capital expenditure to do the job, precisely the most expansionary type of expenditure, as it has the largest multiplier. This is particularly problematic in countries with low capital stocks. Moreover, if expansionary policies are to have any impact, spending efficiency must be high.

## The (In)Efficiency of Public Spending

## Technical Efficiency: Doing the Right Things, Right

## Inefficiency in Procurement: Corruption Matters

## Inefficiency in Civil Services: Does It Pay to Work for Government?

The government wage bill, about \$400 billion each year in Latin America and the Caribbean, is another key input in the production of government goods and services. A large part of the inefficiency of public spending derives from the functioning of a civil service that is not always based on optimal criteria. Efficiency and effectiveness in government performance depend on the talent of public employees and the quality of their knowledge and skills compared to their total compensation. In fact, for many institutions, their greatest asset is their people. In the case of the public sector, the workforce is responsible for the design and implementation of public policies.

But the relevance of human resources in the public sector is also reflected in its cost to taxpayers, that sometimes can surpass its productivity. The general government's wage bill in Latin America and the Caribbean represented, on average, 29.0 percent of public expenditures and 8.4 percent of GDP. This is a higher proportion of wages in total spending than in OECD countries (24.2 percent, or 10.6 percent of GDP; Figure 3.5). However, countries in the region vary widely; some countries, such as El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Argentina,[11] are high wage bill spenders (more than 29 percent of government spending), ranking even higher than the average of OECD countries.

While the wage bill consumes 29.0 percent of general government spending, its share is much higher for local governments than for the

central government in several countries. In Argentina, 76 percent of the wage bill corresponds to provincial and municipal spending, making up more than half of all provincial spending. In Brazil, the wage bill is almost 54 percent, while in Peru and Mexico, it is 42 percent.

Do Latin American and Caribbean countries spend more on wages because of larger public payrolls, higher wage rates, or both? There is no "right size" of the public service workforce (OECD, 2011b).

average 12.7 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, less than the 17.4 percent public employment in the OECD in 2015-2016 (Figure 3.6A). Certainly, these averages vary in both regions: in the OECD, public employment ranges from 5.9 percent in Japan and 15.3 percent in the United States to nearly 30 percent in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. In Latin America, the range runs from 4 percent in Colombia to about 10 percent in Paraguay, Mexico, and Chile, to over 20 percent in Argentina, Trinidad and Tobago,

and Barbados. $^{12}$  There is a positive (weak) relationship between the share of public employment in total employment and the level of development. $^{13}$  But, SNGs have higher levels of public employment than central governments, especially in federal countries: for the OECD the proportion is 57.7 percent while for Brazil it is 88 percent, Argentina, 84 percent, Mexico, 65 percent and Costa Rica, 37 percent. While the high subnational spending on wages might be explained by the hiring of teachers and doctors in several countries at the subnational level, it might also signal lower governance and accountability to overstaffing and even the hiring of ghost workers. It may also reflect a lack of incentives and capacity to invest in productive spending. $^{14}$

While public employment is not uniformly higher in Latin America and the Caribbean than in the OECD, even controlling for development, much of the larger wage bill in Latin American and Caribbean countries can be attributed to a high public wage premium, that is, the average wages of public sector workers are greater than those of the private sector. Public wage premiums might occur for several reasons: 1) skills (such as education and experience) might differ between both sectors, 2) the government's monopolistic power or focus on vote maximization may explain a noncompetitive wage-setting process (Reder, 1975),<sup>15</sup> 3) higher union density in the public sector may lead to greater worker bargaining power (European Commission, 2014a), 4) election periods may increase wage premiums (IMF, 2016).

Since the public wage premium or gap could be due to higher skill levels in the public sector, wages between the public and private sectors are compared controlling for observable differences in productivity and skills. For the same levels of human capital, wages in the public sector in 2014 were an average 25 percent higher than in the private sector. Controlling for selection bias with an endogenous treatment-regression model the

12 However, some countries in the region are still guilty of overhiring. A recent study in Central America shows that administrative staff per teacher and per health sector professional increased irrationally in most countries between 2007 and 2013, raising questions about the efficiency of expanding the public sector to improve delivery of much-needed public services (Dumas and Lafuente, 2016).  
13 A 25 percent increase in GDP per capita in the Latin America-OECD sample is associated with a 1 percentage point increase in public employment. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in public employment.  
This issue is tackled later in the chapter.  
For a set of OECD countries, a recent study found that openness to international trade and improvements in the institutional quality of governments are associated with decreases in the public-private wage gap (Campos et al., 2017).

average wage premium increases to about 34 percent (Cerda and Pessino, 2018a).<sup>16</sup> The wage premium in favor of public sector employees in Latin America and the Caribbean is one of the highest in the world (IMF, 2016). Moreover, this premium increased over the last 15 years, perhaps fueled by the 2003-2009 commodity boom (Figure 3.6B).

Interestingly, most studies uncovered heterogeneous results related to the increase in the wage differential in favor of public workers: whereas the wage gap is more than 20 percentage points for employees with less than 13 years of education, the wage gap falls sharply for those with more than 13 years of education.[17] Qualified workers may be figuratively paying in some countries to work in the public sector, or strong unions in the public sector may be protecting the wages of the less skilled. In addition to higher wages, public sector employees usually enjoy many nonwage benefits such as health care and retirement plans, as well as greater job security, implying that the differential in the total compensation package may go beyond just wage earnings.

The factor affecting efficiency in most countries is the public-sector wage gap, particularly for less-skilled workers, even when controlling for productivity. These estimates do not consider the number of workers, which is a problem in some countries at the national or subnational level.

Under a moderate scenario, $^{18}$  overall wage bill inefficiency is on average 1.2 percentage points of GDP (14 percent of wage spending or about \$52 billion). $^{19}$  The countries that waste the most are those with higher wage premiums and a lower proportion of unskilled workers: El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Ecuador (higher than 20 percent),

and Colombia and Costa Rica (higher than 15 percent). $^{20}$  Using a different methodology, the inefficiency loss in the wage bill in the education and health sectors was found to be about 0.9 percent of GDP, which is consistent with the 1.2 to 3.1 percent loss for the overall wage bill estimated here (Cavallo and Serebrisky, 2016).

## Age-Related Spending: Favoring the Elderly over the Young

The good news: people in Latin America and the Caribbean are living longer and healthier. The region's advances in health and life expectancy are a major accomplishment. The bad news: a longer-living, aging population poses long-term fiscal challenges and, unlike Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean is growing older before its incomes rise sufficiently. Many Latin American and Caribbean countries spend heavily on pension and health benefits today, even though their populations are still relatively young. This fiscal burden is going to increase further over the coming decades as the number of old people rises much more rapidly than it did in Europe.

The worldwide decline in birth rates and increase in life expectancy (or lower mortality rates) is known as the demographic transition. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the percentage of the population aged 65 and above jumped from about 3.5 percent in 1950 to 7.6 percent in 2015 and will climb to 19.4 percent in 2050 (Figure 3.9A). In fact, the number of people over 65 will triple in the region in the next 35 years from 48 million to 150 million. Given the current retirement age, more people will have to be supported for a longer period of time by fewer people (if there is no change in the labor force of older people). In Europe, the population aged 65 and above took 65 years to triple from 1950 to 2015, giving more time to accommodate the older generation (Figure 3.9B).

In fact, as the population transitions from high to low levels of fertility and mortality rates, a country can enjoy the "demographic dividend" (Mason and Lee, 2006), that is, the result of a temporary, proportionately higher working-age population growth relative to the economically dependent population.[24] As fertility levels decline, the dependency ratio falls initially because the proportion of children decreases while the proportion of the working-age population increases, and the older cohort is still small. This window of opportunity for Latin America and the Caribbean is

much smaller than in Europe; it started approximately in 2005 and will last about 30 years until 2035-2040 (Figure 3.9A). The window of opportunity in Europe lasted longer, from 1950 to 2000 (Figure 3.9B).

Is the window an asset or a liability? This will largely depend on how governments use it to their advantage. Without major reform that induces older people to work longer, human capital to increase, or tax rates to increase unacceptably, pension programs will either go into an increasing deficit or pay a much-reduced pension. Before the declining trend ends, the region could exploit this bonus by raising the skills and productivity of the workforce, thereby alleviating the burden of dependents on workers.

Pension spending continued to increase to reach 4.4 percent of GDP in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Not surprisingly given the region's younger population, this is below the EU average of 9 percent. However, even with fewer old people, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina spend more than the OECD average (Figure 3.10A). The differences in current public pension spending across countries reflect mainly differences in old-age dependency ratios, the generosity of benefits, and coverage rates. European economies have replacement rates $^{25}$  of between 40 and 60

percent, near universal coverage, and old-age dependency ratios above 20 percent. Latin American and Caribbean replacement rates in defined benefit systems are higher than 60 percent and, in some countries, almost 100 percent (Berstein et al., 2018); coverage in direct benefit (DB) systems is less than 50 percent and, hence, compensated with more noncontributory pensions coverage, and old-age dependency,[26] will increase rapidly from 11.5 percent in 2015 to 27.6 percent in 2065 (Figure 3.10B).[27]

In theory, the contributory pension system covers employed and sometimes self-employed persons and is financed by contributions levied on employment earnings. Most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (16) have a DB pension system committed to paying a pension based on the last wage or an average of wages in the last five or 10 years. Five of the 26 IDB countries (Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic) have a defined contribution (DC) system (in transition), where each worker contributes to their pension through their individual account and receives what he has contributed at the end of his working life. Another five countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay) have a mixed DB and DC system. One of the main reasons to shift from a DB to a DC pension plan is that the DC plan provides a clear and direct link between contributions and benefits. However, changing systems did not correct the original design flaw. Pensions are still associated with workers' formal status. Thus, despite the change, informal workers continue to have low coverage.[28] Also, since mandatory payroll contributions are required for both systems, the government has an implicit contingent liability in case the private system does not deliver a pension or the threshold of a predefined minimum pension. In fact, in the last decade most of the DC systems, confronted with lower real rates of interest[29] and, hence, low replacement rates, enacted minimum pension guarantees financed by the government,[30] converting implicit into

26 Persons aged 65 and older for every 100 people aged 15-64.  
27 Hence, Latin America and the Caribbean would go from having 9 working-age people per person aged over 65 years to only 2.7 working-age persons.  
28 Mandatory payroll contributions remained high and conditions for receiving a pension tightened, without giving incentives to informal employees. Hence, coverage rates for these systems and the overall contributory system in the region remain low.  
29 When capitalization systems started in Chile in 1981, and then in the early 1990s in Peru, Colombia, and Argentina (which in 2008 reverted back to a DB system), returns on portfolios were in excess of 8 percent. But then average returns deteriorated, especially after the 2007 crisis, to at most 3 percent, depending on the portfolio composition.  
30 Except Uruguay, the other nine countries with DC systems, confronted with low interest rates and expecting low replacement rates, enacted a guaranteed minimum pension. In some cases, the guarantee is fixed at some level of the minimum wage.

explicit contingent liabilities. Risks to financial sustainability in DC systems arise, then, from the transition, the social pension, and guaranteed minimum pensions. During the transition, the challenge is how to finance the benefits to workers who have already retired or will retire soon but belong to the old system.[31] In some countries, a social security fund has given rise to the notion that it is a self-sustaining program that poses no threat to the broader fiscal outlook. The reality, however, is that social security spending is part of consolidated government spending, although sometimes it is off-budget. To gauge the importance of future liabilities on spending for aging, projections are elaborated through a stylized accounting model. The different scenarios[32] draw on demographic projections from the United Nations and methodologies from the European Commission (2009) and IMF (2011) to derive spending projections (Pessino and Zentner, 2018). For DB pensions, the simplest scenario is that pension spending as a percentage of GDP changes only with the OAD ratio and the employment rate.[33] These are rough estimates than using an actuarial model that is more detailed in terms of the earning and history of contributions of the different cohorts. This baseline model assumes all the other parameters of the system remain constant: the coverage and the replacement ratio do not change. For most countries, pension spending in the latest year available includes the main public pension system, the noncontributory system, and the most important civil service systems and state systems. The difficulty arises with the projection of the DC systems. If there were no contingent liabilities, just estimating the spending on the transition of the pensioners that are unfunded would be

31 In some cases, the interest rate paid on government debt is lower than the market rate, subsidizing the public sector at the expense of workers' retirement savings. This was the case in El Salvador, which underwent a reform in 2017 and improved the return on savings.  
32 These projections do not predict the most probable event but provide better information and are hence a good planning tool to evaluate current policies and changes.  
33 The identity decomposes public pension expenditure (PE) as a share of GDP (PE/GDP) into four main drivers: aging (measured by the OAD ratio); eligibility rates (the number of pensioners as a proportion of the population 65 and older); replacement rates (the ratio of average pensions to average wages); and labor force participation rates (see IMF [2011] for more details):

enough. But with the potential payment minimum pensions, the government steps in and may end up paying part of the pension of future retirees. $^{34, 35}$

On average, pension spending increases two and a half times from 2015 to 2065.[36] As seen in Figure 3.11A, projected pensions for 2065 vary widely: in countries with DC systems pension's growth will be lower than in DB countries, but continue to rise. Outstanding spending in Brazil's DB system will increase four times owing to the high aging gradient as well as the fact that most people retire before 60 or 65 years old and receive at least the minimum wage as a pensioner.[37]

Health spending is also growing significantly faster than are economies overall. As of 2015, average spending in Latin America was 4 percent of GDP (Figure 3.11B). The region is still only beginning the demographic transition and has not found an efficient health system combination.[38] The literature has identified both aging and nondemographic factors such as income, technological advance, productivity, and health policies (called excess cost growth or ECG) as the key factors behind rising health-spending-to-GDP ratios. Currently, there is almost no actuarial analysis of health expenditure. The health expenditure projection presented here uses UN demographic projections and relative average health-care costs by age[39] to illustrate that long-term healthcare spending in the region could rise significantly over the next five decades.[40] It assumes that demographic

34 Since this probability increases for low-wage workers, a rough assumption is that for the countries with minimum pensions, half of the current pension expenditure will not disappear but will grow in the same way as DB systems. For countries without guarantees (i.e., Uruguay), the assumption is that 25 percent of current spending will be subject to pay (implicit) minimum pensions. A probabilistic model to better capture these contingencies is under construction.  
35 The actual replacement rate for an average worker in a DB system is 43 percent of the average wage, significantly higher than that estimated in a pure capitalization system (29 percent) without minimum pensions (Berstein et al., 2018).  
36 It is less than triple the OAD because of mainly three events: 1) the increase in labor force participation of older cohorts; 2) the lower increase in pension spending as the transition from DB to DC systems ends; and 3) limits placed by some countries on the indexation of pensions to, at most, the level of inflation.  
37 Other recent studies project pensions for a subset of countries (Acosta-Ormaechea, Espinosa-Vega, and Wachs, 2017) and for health (Glassman and Zoloa, 2014).

39 See National Transfer Accounts (NTAs), a system of portraying official national accounts with demographic patterns by age.

Significant uncertainty surrounds health-care projections, not only with risks associated with demographic and nondemographic factors but about uncertainties regarding how health status will change as life expectancy increases.

Note: Panel A: The pension projection assumes a) DB systems are aggregated with noncontributory systems and government spending in DC systems assumed to grow in part as DB systems depending on the existence of minimum pensions or a mixed system; b) the old age dependency ratio was modified according to the population and the inverse of employment ratio projections; and c) in case of a recent reform in pension indexation a change is introduced in the replacement ratio. All the other components of the formula are kept constant. Panel B: The health projection corresponds to Scenario IV in Panadeiros and Pessino (2018) and assumes spending increases because of aging and because there is excess cost-growth, defined as the excess of growth in health expenditure to GDP attributable to the combined effect of nondemographic factors.

factors will not be the only important driver of future health-care expenditures, but that nondemographic factors will play a critical role over the long run. On average, health spending doubles in the next 50 years, 27 percent due to demographic factors and the rest to ECG. Countries that increase proportionally more are because they are aging faster or because health costs, particularly for the old, tend to grow faster than GDP.

Without reforms, public spending on aging in the region (pensions, health care, and education), is expected to increase from 16 percent to

27.6 percent of GDP from 2015 to 2065. $^{41}$  Pension costs are expected to contribute the most to the rise in age-related spending, increasing by 8 percentage points. Public spending on health is expected to rise 5.2 percentage points by 2065, while education expenditure is projected to decline 1.6 percentage points as expenditures per student remain steady at the 2015 level $^{42}$  (Figure 3.12A). Assuming total government spending remains constant as a share of GDP, the amount left for other components of spending should fall from almost 15 percentage points of GDP to just 3.2 percentage points to distribute among infrastructure, human capital, the functioning of the state, and social protection programs, to name a few. The deficit of the system will increase with current contributions reaching unprecedented levels (Pessino and Panadeiros, 2018). The window of opportunity to improve the quality of physical and human capital will be totally lost unless investment is strengthened today, and policies are enacted as soon as possible to accommodate aging.

It is necessary to analyze all the pension entitlements that Latin American and Caribbean countries are implicitly or explicitly committed to paying. They may or may not be in the shortor medium-term budget, but they are commitments that countries should consider when planning future expenditures and taxes.[43] Moreover, it is important to project aging-related spending on a regular basis and adjust the rest of spending to this reality.

What is the result of spending on the elderly rather than on other needs—like public safety or children's programs? How much is spent today on the younger generation compared with the older one? Governments must choose among competing priorities within a more even-handed budget process. Children are the main beneficiaries of education services while older people are the main beneficiaries of health services and pensions. How should expenditure per capita be allocated between the two

41 The EU will increase total aging spending to 26.7 percent of GDP by 2070, similar to the expected increase in Latin America and the Caribbean by 2065. This is expected even though there were pension reforms throughout Europe in recent years (European Commission, 2018a).  
42 The changes in education expenditure (EE) can be decomposed into three elements: demographic changes; costs per student; and enrollment rate. The baseline scenario illustrates the pure impact of demographic changes (the gradual decrease in the share of the young cohorts) on government education expenditure, assuming a fixed student-to-teaching staff ratio and constant enrollment rate.  
43 There is a tendency in Latin America and the Caribbean for the off-budgeting part of consolidated spending to be overspread, and apart from pensions and health, this includes expenditure on public-private partnerships, public firms not accounted for in the budget, etc. The policy implications and best practices on some of these contingent liabilities and off-budget spending are analyzed in Chapter 9.

groups? The decision of how to allocate lifesaving resources between the young and the old is as much about equity as it is about efficiency. Latin American and Caribbean governments spend an average  \$4,000 per capita on people aged 65-plus, about\$ 500 per capita on people

aged 30 to 49,  \$1,000 on young people between 10 and 25 years, and\$ 1,500 from birth to 10 years of age. That is, they spend about four times more on older people than on younger people (Figure 3.12B). The current system of public expenditures is unfair to younger generations: the vast and growing size of unfunded health and retirement benefits will require today's children to bear a heavy tax burden when they grow up to be working-age adults. For the younger cohort's sake, elderly benefits should pay their share of taxes before transferring it to the next generation. While equity is undoubtedly affected by the allocation of public monies across age groups $^{44}$  and across generations, efficiency is also very much affected. A lower accumulation of human capital among disadvantaged families leads to losses in the social rates of return to early childhood investments and impacts growth.

## Spending on Physical Capital, Human Capital, and Transfers

## A Budget for Skills Formation over the Life Cycle

## Allocative Efficiency in Centralized and Decentralized Spending

## Toward Greater Efficiency

Even though Latin America and the Caribbean displays some of the most inefficient public spending in the world, this spending has been increasing strongly in recent decades to reach 29.7 percent of GDP in 2016. In fact, some countries in the region currently spend more than the average OECD country. The issue can be further divided into two separate sets of questions. The first involves technical efficiency, or the inefficiencies within each expenditure component. The second involves allocative efficiency, which entails prioritizing among alternative spending items and allocating expenditure to programs with higher social rates of return.

This chapter first estimated technical inefficiency from the losses incurred by spending inefficiently in procurement, wages, and subsidies and transfers. Waste in procurement is estimated at about 16.7 percent of procurement spending, or 1.4 percent of GDP for the average country. Waste in wages is another important issue. Latin America has one of the world's highest public-private wage gaps in favor of public sector workers. Considering that part of the gap is not warranted, about 14.2 percent of the wage bill spending for the average country is waste. Finally, leakages in energy subsidies, social programs, and tax expenditure amount to 65 percent of theoretical targeted spending. Overall, in procurement, civil service, and targeted transfers, the total average amount of waste is approximately 4.4 percent of GDP and about 16 percent of average government spending. This is equivalent to \(220 billion, somewhere between the GDP of Peru (\)190 billion) and Chile (\(250 billion), two of the region's largest economies. These inefficiency estimates represent a first attempt at the extremely difficult exercise of capturing inefficiencies in sectors that, although sharing some trends, are quite different among countries and require detailed country diagnostics. Such caveats, however, do not make the analysis any less relevant: to date, no comparative analysis of inefficiencies in all inputs used by the government, including the wage bill, is available for the region.

Second, while allocative inefficiency of public spending is pervasive in the region, policymakers face several crucial trade-offs in allocating expenditure by function: 1) between older and younger generations; 2) among physical capital, human capital, and transfers; 3) across ministries and along the life cycle of individuals to maximize much-needed skills formation in the region; and 4) between central and subnational levels. The total allocative inefficiency of these programs is substantial and difficult to estimate in most cases, but some indication of the size is provided in some case studies.

In regard to the first trade-off, several Latin American countries spend heavily on the elderly, some four times what is spent per capita on the youngest cohorts, as coverage and replacement rates of pension systems have increased to levels that rival or exceed those of developed countries. As the population ages, both pension and health spending are expected to more than double. Under these circumstances, it is critical for Latin America and the Caribbean to address this intertemporal budget constraint. In the medium term, even if spending on the elderly increases for demographic reasons alone, other public spending will have to shift or decrease to accommodate that change if no reforms are enacted; and given current contribution levels (high in many countries already), pension systems' deficits may rise to unprecedented proportions. At the same time, the window of opportunity for improving the quality of physical and human capital will be totally lost unless investment is strengthened today and policies are enacted soon to accommodate aging and assure the well-being of current and future generations.

Fiscal policy, particularly the composition or allocative efficiency of public spending, has played an important role in the region's low growth in recent decades. Improving the quality and investment in human capital are important determinants for increasing long-run growth. Moreover, certain public spending items (public investment) boost potential growth, while others (mainly current spending on pensions and transfers) lower potential growth. In addition, spending more on education does not have a direct effect on economic growth, confirming that the link between the quality-adjusted years of schooling indicator is more suited for estimating the impact of education on economic growth. This implies that reallocating spending toward infrastructure and improving quality education spending can raise growth rates over the long run. However, higher spending beyond a particular threshold can decrease growth if not accompanied by better government institutions.

Until recently, Latin America's relative long-term stagnation or low growth was blamed largely on low productivity of factors of production despite an increase in the number of workers and the capital stock. Recent research, however, shows that when human capital is properly accounted for (including not only quantity but quality and OJT), the relative importance of human capital (or labor augmented by quality) explains a larger part of the difference in income per capita. Physical capital and TFP are important in triggering demand (and more productivity) for human capital in the first place. Latin American and Caribbean countries should start to improve conditions for acquiring skills rather than just spending on education and should aim to facilitate OJT by

lifting distortions in the labor market, especially incentives to informality. While school enrollment has increased in most countries, improving cognitive (and noncognitive) skills and reducing fiscal incentives to informality to increase productivity and the amount and returns to OJT seems to have a higher payoff and greater potential for permanently increasing incomes.

Since skills need to be enhanced in the region at the family, school, and work levels, improving the allocative efficiency of public spending on skills is paramount. To maximize returns at minimum costs, spending should be allocated to the highest social return at each stage in the life cycle. But today only a fifth of spending is allocated to children under 6 compared to primary school children. Average rates of return to early education are underestimated for low-skilled children from disadvantaged families, while average returns to secondary and tertiary education over-estimate the return to disadvantaged children. The opposite is true for students from more advantaged backgrounds. Since average returns are often perceived as being based on skills acquired along the life cycle rather than at particular crucial times, public spending tends to overemphasize higher learning and underemphasize spending on the earlier years of the life cycle when disadvantaged students will gain the most. Hence, public spending on skills suffers from tremendous allocative inefficiency, affecting growth and equity.

Finally, unless governments decentralize both spending and revenues efficiently, improve the definition of functions between central and subnational governments, and enhance the capabilities of local governments, it will be difficult to advance the regional allocative efficiency of public spending. The average Latin American country spends 19 percent of consolidated spending at the subnational level; with six countries spending between 32 and 47 percent. However, SNGs rely on central government transfers for about two-thirds of their spending. The region's current decentralization structure is not conducive to allocative efficiency in spending, as SNGs are more efficient when they spend revenues that they levy themselves through subnational taxes rather than central government transfers or natural resource windfalls.

Governments in the region risk low, stagnant growth and fiscal sustainability problems. They do so by being excessively large or by spending heavily on transfers and pensions before their populations become relatively old and wealthy without at the same time improving the quality of investment in infrastructure and human capital—especially skills. How, then, can governments make room in their budgets to increase human and physical capital expenditures? One way is to reduce waste in procurement,

civil service payrolls, and transfers, which currently equal about 4.4 percent of GDP. Another is to reallocate expenditures away from transfers, particularly those that have proven least effective in reducing poverty and inequality. Chapter 9 of this report, which focuses on institutions, presents lessons learned from countries in the region and elsewhere to improve the design of public expenditure policy and management in order to increase the efficiency of public spending.
