# 6 Making Spending Count in Education

Spending on primary and secondary education has increased significantly in Latin America and the Caribbean in recent decades. Since 2000, public expenditure per student has increased in real terms by almost 80 percent at the primary level, and almost 45 percent at the secondary level, surpassing \$2,000 per student at both levels.<sup>1</sup> These growth rates are more than double those in primary school spending and quadruple those in secondary school spending over the same period in OECD countries. This increase in spending has occurred in a favorable macroeconomic environment highlighted by higher per capita income, lower poverty rates, and declining socioeconomic inequality—all in the context of a heightened focus on education (see Table 6.1). Between 1995 and 2013, investment in education grew from 3.6 percent to 5.3 percent of GDP in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Happily, the investments have paid off in better service delivery. The student-teacher ratio decreased from 24.4 to 17.3 between 2000 and 2014, implying increasingly smaller class sizes.[2] School infrastructure is also improving. One common proxy for investment in school facilities is the availability of computers per student; according to data from the PISA study,[3] in Latin America and the Caribbean the ratio of computers to students grew 20 times between 2000 and 2015.[4] Still, according to a recent

study based on TERCE $^5$  data, educational infrastructure remains insufficient and unequal in spite of improvements over the last decade (Duarte, Jaureguiberry, and Racimo, 2017).

The performance of school systems in the region is also improving. Data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) show that the percentage of adolescents aged 15-19 who finished primary school increased from 86.9 percent to 92.4 percent between 2000 and 2015. Additionally, the PISA study shows that student learning has improved in the region. Overall, between 2000 and 2015 math, reading, and science scores for the region increased almost 10 percent, 6 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. Specifically, the PISA study shows that learning is improving in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.[6]

These data suggest that the increase in expenditures may have been effective in improving school services and educational outcomes. However, while spending per student is growing at a comparatively higher rate in the region, Latin American and Caribbean governments, on average, still only allocate a quarter of the amount OECD countries spend per student and have much lower educational outcomes. More concretely, in the PISA 2015, while close to 15 percent of 15-year-old students from the OECD achieved advanced learning in science, math, or reading, less than 1.5 percent of Latin American and Caribbean students performed at this level. For Latin American and Caribbean countries to reach the performance levels of the most developed countries, investment in education needs to continue to rise. While the level of financial resources is important, and some have suggested a minimum per-pupil spending threshold for a country to be able to deliver a minimum quality of service,[7] the growing consensus among scholars is that, beyond a minimum spending threshold, how resources are spent is much more important than how much is spent. Spending more money is not the most important factor. Making that spending count is the key.

# School Efficiency and Equity

Before increasing investment in education, it is crucial to know how efficiently resources are being used in order to justify future investments (Psacharopoulos, 1996). On the one hand, this means investing money in public education where it will benefit society the most (allocative efficiency). On the other hand, it also means ensuring that each country's

educational system makes the best possible use of available resources (technical efficiency) (Bessent and Bessent, 1980).

No less important than the efficiency of spending, however, is the equity of its distribution. Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, education has been recognized as a human right to be enjoyed on the basis of equality of opportunity (UNICEF/UNESCO, 2007). In line with this, the school finance literature suggests that fairness in resource allocation implies the absence of a relation between the school community's wealth and a school's funding, equitable treatment of students with similar backgrounds, compensatory programs to account for social disparities, and equality of educational opportunity (BenDavid-Hadar, 2016).

# Educational Efficiency: Two Sides of the Same Coin

How does the efficiency of school systems in Latin American countries compare with countries in other regions? What are the challenges in the way educational resources are invested? These questions can be addressed in terms of the two most studied types of efficiency: allocative efficiency and technical efficiency (Haelermans and Ruggiero, 2013). While both types of efficiency will be discussed, due to data constraints<sup>8</sup> the focus of the analysis is on technical efficiency.

# Resource Allocation: Investing Wisely

In the context of school finance, allocative efficiency is reached when educational funds are distributed in the most socially efficient way across educational levels. Although there is no research consensus on how educational resources should be ranked, prioritizing public education funding for preschool (0 to 5 years old) appears to have the highest social returns (Heckman, 2012). Early experiences often have persistent and significant effects on a wide array of important adult outcomes (Berlinski and Schady, 2015). Moreover, investments made in the early years of child development

might increase the return on investments made later in life (Cunha and Heckman, 2007).

Despite this evidence, the debate persists over expenditure allocation at different educational levels. For example, a study by Mingat and Tan (1996) suggests that the focus of educational investments should depend on the country's income level. Specifically, low-income countries benefit the most from investments to expand primary education, while in middle-income countries, investments to expand secondary education show the highest social returns. In high-income countries, investing to expand higher education coverage yields the greatest returns.

The two perspectives presented above imply different policy approaches. On the one hand, focusing educational investments on the early years can be cost-effective since it can save on future investments by increasing individuals' readiness to learn new abilities as adolescents or adults, and enhancing work productivity in the economy. On the other hand, from a macro perspective, poorer countries might need to begin investing in the improvement of basic conditions in their school system before boosting investments in preschool or post-secondary education. Both perspectives complement each other and help explain the different combinations countries use to allocate their educational resources.

and in OECD countries as a benchmark. The data suggest that most Latin American and Caribbean countries are not focusing their investments on preschool. Only three of the 12 countries for which data were available allocate a significantly higher share of their educational funds to pre-primary education than the OECD average (Chile, Guatemala, and Peru). Additionally, higher-income countries tend to invest more in tertiary education, with four of the five highest-income countries (Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia) investing more than 20 percent of their education funds at this level. The exception is Brazil, which spends 18 percent on higher education, 6 percentage points less than the OECD average. Similarly, four of the five lowest-income countries (Honduras, Bolivia, Guatemala, Belize, and Jamaica) invest less than 20 percent of their education funds in post-secondary education. In this case, the exception is Bolivia, which spends 26 percent on tertiary education.

# Technical Efficiency: Same Investment, Better Results

Technical efficiency examines the efficient use of resources once they have been allocated (De Witte and López-Torres, 2017). Given availability of data, this analysis of technical efficiency focuses on the school level using the 2015 PISA dataset. The 2015 PISA study assessed the learning of approximately 540,000 students, representing almost 29 million 15-year-olds enrolled in schools in the 72 participating countries. The focus of the PISA 2015 assessment was on science, with reading, mathematics, and collaborative problem-solving as the secondary domains. School principals also completed a questionnaire providing information on the school system, the learning environment, and the availability of resources at the school level (OECD, 2016b). The original PISA dataset is constructed at the student level, but the data were aggregated to perform the analysis at the school level using only information from schools that receive public funds.[9]

Technical efficiency can be measured by assuming that schools transform inputs into outputs through a production process (Worthington, 2001; Rice and Schwartz, 2015). Measuring the average school efficiency of each educational system that participated in PISA 2015 begins by examining the concept of productivity in education (e.g., Hanushek, 1979). In manufacturing, "average productivity" is typically defined and measured as the

amount of output produced per unit of input. $^{10}$  This seemingly straightforward concept is much more complex when applied to education (Rice and Schwartz, 2015). There is no general agreement on the fundamental goals of public education. While standardized tests that measure learning in math, language, and science are the most common metric for assessing efficiency in education, many scholars and policymakers question whether other outputs such as civic responsibility, cultural awareness, and social and economic mobility should also be considered (Brighouse et al., 2018).

A debate persists over what inputs generate the desired outputs in education. The education production function usually focuses on the inputs that produce learning. There is relative agreement that adequate infrastructure, class size, teacher salaries, and teacher qualifications are key determinants of school spending. However, less consensus exists on the optimal level of investment in each schooling input or under what circumstances a particular input is most effective in producing student learning (Rice and Schwartz, 2015). Also, learning measured by scores on standardized tests reflects not only the potential impact of schooling inputs but also the influence of students' families and communities.

Thus, the literature has divided inputs into two categories: i) discretionary and ii) non-discretionary. Discretionary inputs are factors under the control of the education system, and can be defined as physical inputs, such as teacher training, class size, infrastructure quality, and other resources in the school. They can also be expressed in terms of expenditure. However, a shortcoming of this definition is that disparities in expenditure across countries may reflect differences in the labor market that are unrelated to availability of resources, such as teacher bargaining power. Non-discretionary inputs are composed of environmental inputs that are not under the direct control of the education system. The most important environmental factors are family socioeconomic status and student innate ability (Sutherland, Price, and Gonand, 2009).

The choice of outputs and inputs is based on the work of De Witte and López-Torres (2017). The PISA science score serves as the output since it is the focus of the 2015 assessment. In relation to inputs, physical inputs are used instead of expenditure per student. Efficiency results using expenditure per student as an input would be difficult to interpret because they would reflect both potential inefficiencies and differentials in cost provision between countries (Afonso and St. Aubyn, 2006). Six of the seven cross-country studies reviewed used the following physical inputs: teacher/student

ratio, computer availability, and students' socioeconomic status. $^{11,12,13}$  The teacher/student ratio can be thought of as a proxy for the quantity of human resources (teachers); the number of computers per student (in one representative class in each school) is used as an indirect measure of school facilities; and socioeconomic status is a control for student background. $^{14}$

Outputs and inputs at the school level were used to identify inefficient schools (below the threshold), efficient schools (on the threshold), and super-efficient schools (above the threshold). The method described above assigns an efficiency score to each school. When this score is less than 1, it means that the school could organize and use its inputs in a more efficient way. If the score is equal to 1, it means that the school is on the threshold, and if the score is above 1, then the school is super-efficient, given its inputs.

The average efficiency score by country is reported in Figure 6.2, along with the schools located in percentiles 10 and 90 in each system. Seven of

11 The index was created by the PISA study based on the following variables: the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI); the highest level of education of the student's parents, converted into years of schooling; the PISA index of family wealth; the PISA index of home educational resources; and the PISA index of possessions related to "classical" culture in the family home, such as works of classical literature, poetry, and art (e.g., paintings). See https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5401.  
Although this analysis followed the literature closely to select the inputs, it could have considered other inputs in the analysis. For example, teacher quality, infrastructure quality, instruction time at the school, and instruction time outside the school might be relevant inputs that are omitted from the analysis due to data constraints in several countries. Some exercises compute the efficiency levels, including the percentage of teachers holding a master's degree as a proxy for teacher quality. However, these results were not reported given the debate on whether holding a master's degree is a good proxy for teacher quality (Ladd and Sorensen, 2015). For the case of infrastructure quality, a variable reported by principals in the PISA study is physical infrastructure shortages, but answers depend on what the principal considered to be inadequate or poor-quality physical infrastructure. Thus, this variable is not included in the analysis. Regarding time in and outside the school, students report the minutes per week they study out of school and learning time in school. However, this information is not available for several countries so it was not included as an input.  
13 Some 66 countries participating in PISA 2015 have information for all of these inputs. These countries are used for the analysis.  
14 Student socioeconomic status can also be thought of as a proxy for teacher quality since research shows that higher-quality teachers tend to work in schools with a higher proportion of advantaged students (Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2002; Jackson, 2009; Bonesrønning, Falch, and Strøm, 2005). However, evidence suggests that this may not be the case in every education system. For example, research on the Republic of Korea shows that the distribution of qualified teachers is skewed toward disadvantaged children (Luschei, Chudgar, and Rew, 2013). This is likely due to the mandatory teacher rotation policy in that country.

the eight most efficient systems are from East Asia, $^{15}$  and the least efficient countries tend to be from Latin America, Western Asia, Africa, and Southeast Europe.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the results indicate that 90.2 percent of schools are below the threshold and could improve their output by an average of 17.3 percent by reallocating education inputs. These values are 86.8 percent and 12.5 percent for OECD countries, respectively.

The results above vary significantly by country. While all schools in the Dominican Republic and 98 percent of Peruvian, Trinidadian, and Costa Rican schools are below the threshold, a significantly smaller proportion of Mexican schools are inefficient (71 percent). For other Latin American and Caribbean countries, the proportion of schools below the threshold is around 90 percent (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay).

The degree to which these below-the-threshold schools can improve also varies by country. In the Dominican Republic, schools using the same level of inputs could improve their output by 28 percent, in Peru and Trinidad and Tobago 22 percent, Uruguay 20 percent, Costa Rica 18 percent, Chile 16 percent, Brazil 14 percent, and Mexico and Colombia 12 percent.

In highly efficient systems, such as those of Vietnam, Japan, and Estonia, the percentage of schools below the threshold is much lower (32 percent, 52 percent, and 70 percent, respectively), and the degree to which they could improve keeping the same level of input is much smaller (5 percent, 9 percent, and 6 percent, respectively).

The number of Latin American countries participating in PISA tests is relatively low; only nine countries in the region had PISA scores available for this analysis. It is hard to understand how well educational systems are doing when scant information is available on student and school performance.

The results above show that efficiency levels vary among Latin American and Caribbean countries. While Mexico and Colombia seem to be doing well (conditional on the amount of resources allocated to education), with efficiency levels higher than the median, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica are below the median. Finally, Brazil and Chile are close to the median. It must be noted that being more

efficient does not necessarily mean that results (i.e., outputs) are better, but rather that, given the amount of resources available, a particular country is closer to the efficiency threshold.

# Educational Equity

While efficiency is an important issue in education policy reform discussions, most governments are also concerned with equity in their school systems. School systems that distribute country and school resources more equitably tend to perform better academically (see Chiu, 2010). Thus, in Latin America and the Caribbean, with its high levels of income inequality and poor academic performance, educational equity has become a salient policy issue.

The design of an equitable education system, in which outcomes are independent of factors that lead to educational disadvantage, would attempt to provide a fair distribution of inputs, processes, and outputs among all participants in education (Kelly, 2012). The school finance literature has identified five criteria of fairness in resource allocation: 1) neutrality, minimizing the link between school communities' wealth and schools' funding; 2) horizontal equity, meaning that students who are alike should be treated the same; 3) vertical equity, or the recognition that some groups of students need more resources than others to achieve fairness; 4) need-based, that is, fairness is achieved through differential per-student compensation for initial deficits; and 5) equality of educational opportunity, implying that there is a fair starting point, especially for students from disadvantaged and/or minority groups (BenDavid-Hadar, 2016).

The two most studied dimensions of equity are horizontal and vertical (Bandaranayake, 2013; Levacic, 2008b; Toutkoushian and Michael, 2007). Horizontal equity is based on the principle of "equal treatment of equals," which means that funds should be allocated equally among schools that share certain characteristics. Vertical equity follows the philosophy of "unequal treatment of unequals," which implies that if students have different educational needs, an equitable funding system should provide different levels of resources to meet these needs. Typically, educational needs are defined in terms of educational inputs needed to achieve a defined level of performance (Rubenstein, Doering, and Guess, 2000; Berne and Stiefel, 1999).

Various indicators have been proposed to measure horizontal and vertical equity (Nina et al., 2006; Verstegen, 2015; Kelly, 2015). For horizontal equity, the most common indicators are the McLoone and GINI indices. The former measures equity only for the lower half of the distribution of educational resources, in the range 0 to 1; higher values are associated

with greater horizontal equity. The GINI indicates how far the distribution of educational resources is from providing each proportion of schools with an equal proportion of resources. It ranges between 0 and 1, but in this case higher values are associated with lower horizontal equity.

Vertical equity is a more complex concept and difficult to operationalize since educational needs vary by student and how to identify those needing greater compensation is subject to debate (Vesely and Crampton, 2004). Different studies have attempted to identify the factors that put children at risk of academic failure to justify a greater allocation of resources to these students. These factors vary by education system and by region. For example, while in Latin American and Caribbean countries the indigenous population might be at a disadvantage, in the United States and European Union, black and immigrant children may be the most disadvantaged (McEwan and Trowbridge, 2007; Condron et al., 2013; Schnell and Azzolini, 2015). Among the most cited risk factors for students' academic failure are poverty, race, ethnicity, disability, poorly educated parents, and remoteness of school location. According to some studies, poverty is the most consistent predictor of academic failure (Bandaranayake, 2013; Land and Legters, 2002).

Given the above, the measure of vertical equity in this analysis assumes that poorer students should have more educational resources than richer students. For reasons of simplicity, other factors of disadvantage are not considered. The two indicators commonly used to measure vertical equity are: 1) the Concentration index and 2) the reformulated McLoone index. The former is frequently used to measure inequality in one variable over another variable, and it is usually employed to capture the extent to which educational resources differ across schools ranked by a socioeconomic indicator. Its range is between -1 and 1; negative values indicate that educational resources are higher for poorer schools and positive values indicate the opposite. The second index is a variation of the original McLoone index, but the ordering variable for identifying the half of schools to examine is the socioeconomic index. Its range is between 0 and infinity, and values greater than 1 represent systems that target disadvantaged students.[16]

In general, educational resources are measured by the expenditure per student in each school, but some studies use the availability of schooling inputs (e.g., Rao, 2011). Many of the educational systems that participate in PISA do not have data on expenditure per student at the school level; it is not clear whether those systems without such data available are comparable across systems. For this reason, equity indices are based on the same

schooling inputs used for the efficiency analysis (i.e., teacher/student ratio and availability of computers).<sup>17</sup> Specifically, each equity indicator is computed separately for each input and then averaged among the two input results.

Table 6.2 shows the averaged equity indicators on educational resources at the school level for Latin America and the Caribbean, the OECD, and other regions. The results suggest that Latin American and Caribbean countries have lower levels of horizontal equity compared to the OECD and other regions, but relatively similar levels of vertical equity.

The relatively lower levels of horizontal equity with respect to vertical equity could reflect a combination of factors. On the one hand, there may be a lack of transparency related to (1) the rules regulating the distribution of inputs across schools, (2) the sources of funding of inputs, and (3) the level of government at which decisions are made on the level of inputs. Indeed, the design of specific resource allocation rules, the sources of funding, and the decision-making authority over educational inputs can impact the equitable distribution of resources within education systems. On the other hand, the relatively higher results for vertical equity could reflect the presence of compensatory mechanisms in the systems under consideration (e.g., teacher incentives to work in more disadvantaged areas in Peru, Colombia, and Chile, weighted per-pupil subsidies in Chile, and targeted programs in most systems).

The regional averages mask the heterogeneity within the Latin American and Caribbean region. Figure 6.3 displays the position of each system regarding vertical inequity (y-axis showing the concentration index) and horizontal equity (x-axis showing the McLoone index). No Latin American or Caribbean country is above the McLoone average, indicating low levels

of equity in the availability of educational resources among the poorer half of schools. The Dominican Republic is the most horizontally unequal system in the study, followed by Peru. Uruguay is the fifth most horizontally unequal system and Brazil the seventh.

The concentration index shows that in six of the nine Latin American and Caribbean systems, educational resources tend to favor disadvantaged students, especially in Colombia and Costa Rica, where levels of vertical inequity are as low as in Portugal, Ireland, Korea, and in Lithuania, which has the second lowest level, after Japan, in the OECD. For the other three systems, the Dominican Republic and Brazil are the two most vertically unequal countries in the study. Mexico's level of inequity is similar to that of Turkey, Sweden, and Luxemburg, where it is positive but rather small, implying the equal availability of educational resources for poorer and richer schools. This, in effect, favors the affluent since they benefit from more resources in their home environment (as positive values indicate that educational resources are lower for poorer schools).

# The Worst of Both Worlds

To deepen the analysis of efficiency and equity, the efficiency measure is correlated with the McLoone index (horizontal equity), and with the concentration index (vertical inequity). Figure 6.4 shows the first set of these

associations and divides systems according to whether they are above or below the mean on each indicator. Vietnam, Singapore, and Hong Kong are highly efficient and horizontally equitable systems. On the other hand, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Tunisia, and Lebanon are relatively inefficient and horizontally inequitable at the same time. Figure 6.4 also shows that more efficient systems tend to be more horizontally equitable.

Figure 6.5 shows the correlation between efficiency and vertical inequality and divides systems according to whether they are above or below the efficiency mean, and whether they allocate more inputs to lower socioeconomic status (SES) schools (Concentration index less than zero) or to higher SES schools (Concentration index greater than zero). Japan and Korea are highly efficient and distribute schooling inputs progressively. Conversely, the Dominican Republic and Lebanon are relatively inefficient and vertically inequitable. More efficient systems are less likely to be vertically inequitable or less regressive in the allocation of school inputs.

Despite data constraints and limitations, the results for efficiency and equity shed light on how challenges related to school finance policy vary across countries. For example, Colombia has relatively greater efficiency and equity levels than other Latin American and Caribbean countries, which might suggest that increasing the amount of resources invested in public schools may have a positive impact on achievement and narrow test score gaps. Brazil's school system appears to be relatively efficient but has high levels of both types of inequities. Thus, increasing and targeting future investments in the most disadvantaged schools might be an

effective policy. In the Dominican Republic, the low levels of efficiency and equity suggest the need for a policy to boost the system's efficiency prior to increasing investment in public schools.[18] Comparing the efficiency and equity of the Latin American and Caribbean school systems with other regions of the world reveals challenges in all.

# Something in the Air? Explaining Efficiency and Equity

Reviewing efficiency and equity in school education spending for 66 countries revealed that while vertical equity is close to average, horizontal equity and efficiency are relatively low in Latin America and the Caribbean. Moreover, these indicators vary considerably within the region. The next step is to ask why and identify country-level factors associated with these outcomes, following two approaches. First, reviewing available cross-country studies, each of the most widely used variables is correlated with each of three educational outcomes identified earlier in this chapter. Second, focusing on the

institutional components of school finance systems, their main dimensions are assessed in relation to either efficiency or equity outcomes.

# Country Factors

While most research on school education and efficiency is based on within-country comparisons of schools, some studies measure student learning across countries to understand the factors that influence school efficiency from an international perspective (Agasisti and Zoido, 2015).

This scant but growing body of evidence examines whether different country factors are related to school efficiency. Cordero, Santin, and Simancas (2017) explore the potential influence of the public expenditure level on education, gross domestic product per capita, and cultural values of the society on technical efficiency. To measure the latter, they use data from the World Values Survey that collects information on which qualities are most valued when raising a child. Specifically, respondents are given a list of qualities (independence, hard work, responsibility, imagination, tolerance, thrift, perseverance, religious faith, unselfishness, and obedience) that children can learn at home and then asked to choose up to five traits that they think are most important. The authors assess the potential influence of three of these variables (hard work, responsibility, and perseverance), arguing that these comprise the trait known as conscientiousness, which the literature has shown to be highly correlated with educational achievement (Heckman, 2011b).

Agasisti (2014) attempts to gain insight into the relationship between efficiency and contextual country-level variables, which he divides into two categories: 1) educational system factors, including public expenditure, teacher salary, and instruction time, and 2) different socioeconomic factors such as GDP per capita.

Another dimension that may affect the efficiency of educational systems is teacher quality. The literature on this issue is scant, though, since measuring teacher quality at comparable levels across countries can be a challenge. Nonetheless, Hanushek, Piopiunik, and Wiederhold (forthcoming) recently computed measures of teachers' numeracy and literacy skills, providing an internationally comparable measure of teacher skills for 31 countries, which may be used to assess links between teacher quality and efficiency in education systems.[19]

Regarding equity, apparently no cross-country statistical analyses examine potential factors related to inequity in school inputs, but recent studies do associate country-level factors with inequity in school outputs, specifically student learning. Chmielewski and Reardon (2016) conduct a multivariate analysis to associate the achievement-income gap in 19 countries with measures of poverty, income inequality, educational differentiation, and curricular standardization. A similar paper examines the influence of curricular tracking on the income-achievement gap in 15 countries (Cimentada, 2017). Both studies base their measure of curricular tracking on the work of Bol and Van de Werfhorst (2013), who compute a tracking index combining country-level information on the length of tracked curriculum, age of first tracking selection, and number of tracks at 15 years old. This measure is relevant because if students are segregated into ability tracks at early ages, the chances of incurring horizontal inequity are good. These authors also compute measures of the standardization of education in both inputs and outputs. Standardized inputs refer to the extent to which schools have limited control over the use of pedagogical decisions in education (for example, restrictions on what is taught and how, which books are used, etc.). Standardized outputs describe the extent to which educational performance is tested against external standards.

The limited results from these cross-country efficiency and equity analyses shed light on what variables might be related to efficiency or equity. Following these studies, efficiency and equity are correlated with 18 factors grouped into four categories: 1) expenditure level, 2) education system variables reflecting different policy decisions, 3) socioeconomic variables, and 4) societal values.

Table 6.3 shows the number of observations for each of the chosen factors, the average difference between Latin American and Caribbean countries and countries in other regions, and the bivariate correlations with efficiency, horizontal equity, and vertical equity. While these correlations do not imply causality, they do show interesting patterns. More efficient and equitable systems tend to have a higher level of expenditure per student, and their teachers are better trained, as shown by their higher numeracy and literary skills. In countries with more efficient and equitable education systems, citizens seem to understand the need to control corruption, and value responsibility and perseverance. For all these factors, the average value for Latin American and Caribbean countries is lower than that of countries in other regions. Thus, progress along these dimensions could help improve efficiency and equity in the school systems of the region.

Three other interesting results are pertinent to the discussion on education policy. First, systems with a higher salary at the top of the teacher pay

scale tend to have higher levels of efficiency, but not necessarily equity. Second, greater levels of curricular tracking appear to be related to lower levels of horizontal equity, but not to efficiency or vertical inequity. In other words, separating students by abilities at early ages could be associated with allocating different amounts of resources to similar students. Third, systems that standardize what schools can teach and the way they can teach seem to be less efficient. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have room to improve top teacher salaries (paying more to those that are better trained) and reduce their tracking levels. The first measure may be beneficial for efficiency, and the second one, for equity. In terms of standardized pedagogical decisions, the region as a whole has less standardization than other regions, which may help increase efficiency. Finally, those countries with higher GDP per capita and lower levels of income inequality measured by the GINI index tend to be more horizontally equitable. Probably, a higher national income that is distributed more equally is associated with a more homogeneous school system.

# The Role of School Finance Systems

School finance can affect learning outcomes and is, therefore, another policy that can influence efficiency and equity. A school finance system can be defined as the set of formal rules and incentives that affect how resources are raised, governed, allocated, and monitored (Hansen et al., 2007). The literature on school finance system design identifies four key dimensions (OECD, 2017b; Atkinson et al., 2005): 1) sources of funding and transfers between levels of government (i.e., national, subnational, local, and school level); 2) decision-making authority at different levels of government; 3) information and accountability systems; and 4) resource allocation rules. For each dimension a debate rages on the impact of alternative policy designs on the efficiency and equity of education spending.[20]

First, the sources of school funding can be either private or public. Evidence for Argentina and Chile suggests that expanding private funding sources could trigger an increase in spending inequality (Mezzadra and Rivas, 2010; Elacqua, Montt, and Santos, 2013). While public funds may be collected at the central, subnational, local, and school levels,[21] research

shows that where subnational/local governments are the main source of funding, there may be a risk of generating spending inequality across jurisdictions (Farvacque-Vitkovic and Kopanyi, 2014). While wealthier regions are more likely to raise sufficient funds from local tax revenues to provide an adequate level of funding, more disadvantaged jurisdictions may be unable to raise enough money.

In systems where a sizable proportion of funds is generated at the subnational/local level, intergovernmental transfers may be an important instrument for equalizing the spending capacity of different territorial units. School finance reforms have often incorporated equalization grants to address inequality. In Brazil, the Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education and Teacher Appreciation (FUNDEB), is a federally mandated redistributive program intended to reduce regional inequities in per-pupil spending. FUNDEB is a state fund that receives revenues from specific state and municipal taxes. This fund is then redistributed to state and municipal governments based on student enrollments. If per-pupil funds in a state do not meet the national minimum, the federal government provides additional resources to the state's FUNDEB account. Evidence on the effects of FUNDEB indicates that the program decreased interstate inequalities in educational spending (Cruz, 2017).

Second, an ongoing discussion focuses on whether decentralization improves equity and efficiency in the provision of public services. Arguments in favor of decentralized decision-making posit that local leaders may have a better sense of local preferences, and will allocate resources more efficiently (Oates, 2006; Barankay and Lockwood, 2007; Tiebout, 1956). In this scenario, the needs of individual schools can be better addressed because of the closer proximity to decision-making (European Commission, 2000).[22] Additionally, by bringing decisions closer to the interested local community, decentralization may improve the monitoring of teachers and schools by parents and local communities (Galiani, Gertler, and Schargrodsky, 2008).

On the other hand, critics contend that strong reliance on subnational decision-making may raise equity concerns (OECD, 2017b). Arguments for a strong centralized role emphasize the lack of capacity at subnational levels of government to exercise responsibility for public services (Treisman, 2007; Gordon, 2015). Moreover, to the extent that some education-related activities have large fixed costs, such as research and development,

centralized provision allows efficient pooling of resources to operate at scale (Gordon, 2015).

Evidence in Latin America shows that a 2001 reform that decentralized the provision of public education in Colombia improved enrollment rates (Faguet and Sánchez, 2014) but reinforced performance gaps between more and less developed municipalities (Brutti, 2016). In Bolivia, the decentralization of education financing made government more responsive to re-directing public investment to the areas of greatest need (Faguet and Sánchez, 2008).

Third, authorities who make funding decisions are usually held accountable for complying with budgetary laws and regulations and for distributing resources in an efficient and equitable way. In decentralized school systems, controlling the finances of lower level authorities is assumed to be a necessary strategy to ensure adequate allocation of resources (Hanushek, Link, and Woessmann, 2013; Burns and Koster, 2016; OECD, 2017b).

Multi-level governance systems may deal with different types of accountability: governments can be made accountable to citizens (bottom-up accountability), to public agencies (horizontal accountability), and to higher-level authorities (vertical accountability) (Schaeffer and Yilmaz, 2008). Bottom-up accountability includes citizens who hold governments accountable through elections, civil society organizations, and the media. Parental choice of schools also represents a form of bottom-up accountability because it gives parents more power to pressure schools to deliver better education. In Latin America, Chile's school voucher system is the best-known example of school choice.[23]

Peru, Chile, and Colombia have implemented high-stakes vertical accountability in which the central government determines financial incentives for schools, local governments, or teachers based on student achievement and other outcomes. The Chilean system imposes the most severe consequences for low-performing schools: if they do not improve their performance in three years, the Ministry of Education will encourage families to consider another schooling option, as well as facilitate transportation. Moreover, if the low-performing school does not improve for two additional years, the ministry will revoke its license to operate and receive public funding. Low-performing schools in Chile respond to these

accountability pressures by adopting time-efficient measures to improve test scores in the short term, such as relocating effective teachers to grade levels that are evaluated by Chile's high-stakes testing systems (Elacqua et al., 2016). Similarly, Murnane et al. (2017) argues that the combination of more resources and accountability introduced in Chile by the Preferential School Subsidy Law (SEP) in 2008 were the critical mechanisms to increase student learning.

Another example of vertical accountability is when schools condition financial transfers on performance. For example, in Colombia the funding formula that determines how many resources are transferred from the central government to local authorities includes a performance component that allocates more funds to higher-performing regions. No robust empirical evidence evaluates the impact of performance-based funding formulas on school effectiveness.

Additionally, in 2015 Peru implemented a nationwide teacher bonus program that ranked schools according to their performance on the national standardized test. Schools were ranked within groups of similar school districts, instruction time, and location (urban and rural). Every teacher and principal in the top 20 percent of the ranking within each group received a fixed payment of more than a month's salary. Despite these efforts, Bellés Obrero and Lombardi (2017) find no effect of the program on students' performance. They hypothesize that teachers in Peru had no guidance on how to improve their instruction to raise their students' scores on the standardized test. Thus, incentives may need to be properly studied and coupled with additional tools for them to be effective in raising student performance.

Fourth, there is a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the mechanisms to define the amount and transfer of funds to different administrative levels (subnational and local governments) and to schools. In many systems, a funding formula (a formal procedure based on predetermined criteria) is defined to avoid discretionary decisions.

Funding formulas can promote equity because they require equal treatment of administrative units (local governments and schools), while administrative discretion and historical criteria could lead to idiosyncrasies due to incremental adjustments and political games (Levacic, 2008a). Funding formulas may also increase efficiency, since they eliminate the accumulated inefficiencies of historical criteria. Lastly, formulas can increase transparency, because administrative units and stakeholders can anticipate the amount of resources schools will receive (Levacic and Downes, 2004).

At the same time, formulas can cause problems too. They might not be the optimal option to allocate resources for all types of expenditures. For instance, they may be less effective for less permanent spending categories,

like infrastructure, where project-based funding is more common (Levacic and Ross, 1999; OECD, 2017b). Additionally, the implementation of funding formulas requires reliable information on student enrollment and teacher allocation, not always available in less developed countries.

In some Latin American and Caribbean countries, most transfers are based on funding formulas. For instance, Colombia uses well-defined formulas to transfer resources from the national government to Territorial Entities (mainly for the Sistema General de Participaciones—SGP—that represents 65 percent of total spending), and national rules that define salary spending allocation among schools, because pay scale and teacher needs by school are defined at the central level. For the rest of the spending categories, certified entities (ETCs) have more discretion to allocate the resources among different spending categories and among schools.

Chile also has a formula for most spending categories, because central government transfers via per-student vouchers account for approximately 80 percent of total revenue.[24] The voucher subsidies are transferred directly to school owners that can be public (municipalities) or private, and they are allocated based on student attendance rates. Although over the last decade a series of mechanisms have been incorporated to address some of these differences (e.g., base funding for small rural schools and an additional subsidy for full-day schools and for disadvantaged students), many small and medium-sized urban schools are unable to pay minimum payroll and operational costs with the subsidy (Bertoni et al., 2018).

Given the relevance of teachers and the fact that teacher salaries are the main source of expenditure in education, the way teachers are allocated is a key policy topic (Bertoni et al., 2018). In some systems, such as Brazil and Colombia, a fraction of the money transferred from the central government is earmarked and can only be spent on teacher salaries, imposing constraints on local governments' budgets and managerial decisions.

Teacher allocation involves several processes, the most important ones being the hiring process and the allocation of new and experienced teachers. Improving the hiring process has the potential to be a cost-effective policy since it can help avoid the costs of remedial programs by preventing students from being exposed to ineffective teachers (Staiger and Rockoff, 2010). It can also reduce the probability of costly dismissals of ineffective teachers (Rothstein, 2015).

In 2002, the hiring process of Colombian public school teachers was reformed with a selective recruitment process and performance incentives. Brutti and Sánchez Torres (2016) estimate how new quality-screened teachers impact students' high school performance. The authors exploit the fact that the new regulation applied only to newly hired teachers, whereas those already employed in 2002 remained exempt, creating a mix of new-regulation and old-regulation teachers in Colombian schools. Using data at the school-year-subject level, and controlling for school-level confounders, they report a positive and significant effect of new-regulation teachers on student performance.

Once teachers are hired, the way they are placed in schools varies by education system, but a common pattern in Latin America and the Caribbean is that applicants are matched based on entry exam scores in the screening process and applicants' preferences. Applicants with a higher score can usually choose the school of their preference (Bertoni et al., 2018). This may foster inequities since teachers generally prefer to work in schools with fewer disadvantaged students (e.g., Loeb and Wyckoff, 2002). The sorting of effective teachers may be exacerbated in Latin American and Caribbean systems, most of which have few incentives to attract teachers to hard-to-staff schools (Bertoni et al., 2018).

Keeping these debates in mind, comparable data between countries that proxied the main school finance dimensions were correlated with the efficiency and equity measures. Table 6.4 reports the bivariate correlations for nine variables grouped in the four main types of school finance. The reported results show interesting patterns but cannot be interpreted as causal.

Regarding the sources of funding, the data suggest that a higher share of funds that originate from private sources is related to both lower efficiency and lower equity. This association could be relevant for Latin America and Caribbean countries since the private share of their schools' funds are 12 percentage points higher than countries in other regions.

In relation to autonomy, results show that more decentralized systems tend to be more horizontally equal in the decision-making process of teacher hiring and firing, which is consistent with the argument that the needs of individual schools can be better addressed by local authorities because of their closer proximity to conditions on the ground (European Commission, 2000). Additionally, by bringing decisions closer to the interested local community, decentralization may improve the monitoring of teachers and schools by parents and local communities (Galiani, Gertler, and Schargrodsky, 2008).

The more efficient countries tend to have a higher degree of school choice. In the Latin American and Caribbean region, parent involvement in school management varies considerably. The extent of school choice in Chile is high, but parents in most other systems have fewer choices (Elacqua, Ibarren, and Santos 2016) and may not have sufficient information about school performance to make informed decisions.

Finally, the measure for resource allocation indicates that a higher percentage of funds allocated for staff compensation is related to lower efficiency. This result is interesting for Latin American and Caribbean countries since they, on average, rely relatively more on human resource inputs than other countries. The percentage spent on staff compensation is 36 percentage points higher than the other regions considered, perhaps

because of the relevance of teachers' unions in the region and their power in setting wages that may not be necessarily aligned with performance.

# Improving Efficiency and Equity: Lessons Learned

Efficiency estimates in education are limited by a lack of internationally comparable data on schooling inputs and on the design of school finance systems. Despite these shortcomings, available research consistently shows that East Asian countries have the most efficient school systems in the world (Agasisti and Zoido, 2015; Sutherland, Price, and Gonand, 2009). This analysis is consistent with this finding and contributes to the literature by estimating the efficiency level for 66 countries including several in the Latin American and Caribbean region, using data at the school level, something that has been rarely done when analyzing efficiency using DEA models in cross-country studies. Results show that efficiency levels in the region are low: no Latin American and Caribbean countries are in the top 15 systems, and three appear among the 15 least efficient. Only Mexico, Brazil, and Chile are above the average efficiency level of the 66 systems analyzed.

This analysis also examined the equity levels of input distribution between schools across school systems. Vertical equity in Latin America and the Caribbean is, on average, similar to that of more developed countries. This suggests that the increased number of compensatory programs and weighted subsidies (e.g., in Chile and Colombia) introduced in the region in recent decades might have reduced funding disparities. While encouraging, this result should not breed complacency, as countries such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic are among the most unequal in terms of vertical equity in the sample. Regarding horizontal equity, results indicate that schools with similar student demographics receive unequal resources. This type of inequity could improve in the region if the level of transparency in the transfer of resources improved.

In order to improve efficiency and equity in school systems in Latin America and the Caribbean, measures that increase expenditure per student are promising, but not in isolation. Higher spending per student must be accompanied by better accountability measures that reduce corruption, better trained teachers, and better pay for top performers.

Policies related to school finance can also affect efficiency or equity. Latin American countries vary widely in the school finance dimensions of their systems, but it is encouraging that some systems in the region are implementing reforms to increase the efficiency and the equity of public spending in education.

A wide array of school finance policies can be implemented to increase educational outputs by more efficiently allocating inputs. For example,

Colombia's 2001 reform, which changed the spending allocation rule from an input-based to a per-student formula, successfully incentivized territorial entities to increase enrollment rates while preventing overspending on school personnel (Faguet and Sánchez, 2014). The timeliness of a discussion on allocation rules is exemplified in the heated debate in Brazil that occurred in the wake of the recent economic recession; the discussion centered on whether federal contributions to FUNDEB funds should be tied to the performance of school systems, in order to incentivize governments to make better use of resources. Of course, allocation rules must be accompanied by accountability. Studies show that strengthening accountability measures improves education results by reducing corruption (Olken, 2007; Ferraz, Finan, and Moreira, 2012), and by changing in-school behavior in educationally meaningful ways (Elacqua et al., 2016).

With respect to policies that aim to improve equity in the distribution of resources, most evidence shows that when school funding strongly relies on local sources, spending inequalities may arise across jurisdictions (e.g., regions or municipalities). To address these inequities, school finance reforms have incorporated equalization funds as a compensatory tool to overcome these imbalances worldwide. For example, the redistributive role of FUNDEB in Brazil led to a 12.2 percent reduction in the inequality index of municipal resources between 2006 and 2011 (Araujo, 2013). Targeted voucher programs have also been perceived as an effective instrument to tackle learning inequities within school finance systems, particularly when they are weighted, meaning that vouchers for disadvantaged students are more valuable. Evidence from Chile shows that the achievement gap between high and low-income students has narrowed by one third since the government implemented the school subsidy law in 2008 (Murnane et al., 2017). Thus, equalization funds from the central government and weighted vouchers can be effective tools to improve learning overall and to narrow the socioeconomic learning gap.

Regarding decentralization, more autonomy for schools and local governments could allow them to use their knowledge of the local context to make more equitable decisions. However, for this to be an effective policy, the central government will need to support schools and subnational governments that lack the capacity to manage and allocate resources efficiently.

Latin America and the Caribbean shows a much higher share spent on teachers and other human resources than other regions—perhaps hinting at the effect of stronger unions—implying that there may be fewer resources for ancillary services and pedagogical inputs. Providing all the services and materials for students with diverse needs is key to improving efficiency and equity.

# Smart Spending on Citizen Security: Beyond Crime and Punishment

Historically, the debate on citizen security has swung between two poles, both regionally and globally: the "iron fist" or "tough on crime" on the one hand and a social approach to structural causes of crime on the other. Citizen pressure to achieve rapid results and media coverage of high-profile crimes have led many governments to take a hard line and position themselves in the first camp. A harsher and more militarized type of policing, longer prison sentences, and massive incarceration are examples of this punitive view of crime. According to this view, the greater the repression and punishment, the larger the reduction of crime. The opposite side argues that the focus should be on changing the structural causes of crime and violence. Government programs aim to reduce the inequality and social exclusion that favor crime and violence: school dropout, family disintegration, urban poverty, and youth unemployment, among others. Fortunately, a third way combines both preventive and punitive elements backed by scientific evidence of their impact on crime. This approach, known in the Anglo-Saxon world as smart on crime (Waller, 2014), is slowly but surely permeating thinking and practice in the Latin American and Caribbean region.

This chapter argues that before spending more, the region must learn to spend better. And to do that, it must invest more in policies aligned with this third way. Resource availability does not seem to be the main problem. In the past decade, the region increased its spending on safety and justice. However, results do not match this greater fiscal effort. The good news is that many opportunities exist to achieve better results with the same resources. This chapter shows that levels of police efficiency, for example, vary greatly between organizations in the

same country, as well as between countries. Thus, many of them are in a position to produce more services with the same resources. A second step is to make smarter choices about where resources are invested. The emphasis should be on targeted preventive programs, based on evidence of impact. Carrying out these reforms will require influential advocates capable of delivering a powerful argument in favor of smarter spending on security.

Not many public services in the region are like citizen security, where citizens' concerns about the quality and quantity of the service are so great, and where information on allocation and efficiency of spending is so opaque and scarce. This chapter helps to narrow this knowledge gap by presenting the first analysis of the quality of public spending on security for the entire region.<sup>1</sup>

# Fighting Crime: A Regional Priority

Latin America and the Caribbean is the most violent region in the world. It has 9 percent of the population, but 33 percent of the world's homicides. The homicide rate (24 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015) is four times the world average (Figure 7.1). Of the 50 most violent cities in the world, 43 are in the region (CCSPJP, 2018). Almost 140,000 lives are lost every year, distributed very unequally. Although Central America and the Caribbean have the highest rates in the region, just three countries in South America account for 63 percent of the cases (Brazil, 41 percent, Venezuela, 13 percent, and Colombia, 9 percent) (Figure 7.2A). Other South American countries such as Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, and Chile have low homicide rates, but very high rates of property crime (robbery and theft), which translates into high rates of general victimization (Figure 7.2B). One of every five Latin Americans has been a victim of a robbery in the past year and six of every ten robberies involved violence.

The cost of crime to regional welfare is very high, estimated at 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 7.3). It is no surprise then that safety has been the main concern of Latin Americans since 2010 (Figure 7.4).

# The Region's Spending Profile

The region makes a significant fiscal effort in the security sector, spending 5.4 percent of its total budget, almost double the 3.3 percent of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (Figure 7.5). In GDP terms, this spending represents 1.6 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean and 1.5 percent for the OECD. In per capita spending, however, at purchasing power parity (PPP) the median for the OECD ( \$532) is double that of Latin America and the Caribbean (\$ 218), despite its much smaller crime problem.

Latin American and Caribbean countries invest most of their security spending on the police (63.4 percent), followed by criminal justice (22.3 percent), and then prisons (8.7 percent).² In PPP dollars, this represents \$74 billion on police, \$26 billion on justice, \$10 billion on prisons, and \$6.5 billion on other security-related elements. Compared to OECD countries, the region invests proportionately about the same in police, more in

justice, and less in prisons and other areas (particularly research and development) (Figure 7.6).

The spending profiles of countries in both Latin America and the Caribbean and the OECD vary considerably (Figure 7.7). A comparison of each country's position with respect to the "average" of the sample shows that countries such as Argentina and Jamaica concentrate their spending more on police than the average, while Brazil and the Dominican Republic focus more on justice.

Analyzing the weight of each type of spending in the total and its relation to per capita GDP suggests that the more developed a country, the greater the proportion of spending on prisons (and others) compared to police and justice (Figure 7.8). This may be partly because in countries

with lower per capita incomes, crime rates tend to be higher; thus, police spending is prioritized over other spending.

Developed countries, on the other hand, may spend more on prisons because they are under more public pressure to guarantee basic rights for inmates (i.e., lower rates of overcrowding). There is a negative correlation between the proportion of prison spending and the rate of overcrowding, as well as between public spending per prisoner and the rate of overcrowding, which seems to support this hypothesis (Figures 7.9A and 7.9B).

Most spending is invested in personnel—between 50 and 80 percent—and mainly in the police. Median spending on personnel in Latin America and the Caribbean is 10 percentage points higher than in the OECD (80 percent vs. 70 percent, Figure 7.10). In the available sample, Chile and Peru spend the least and Paraguay and Uruguay spend the most on personnel. In all countries, except Chile, personnel spending represents a higher proportion of the police and justice sectors' budget than of the prison budget. (Figure 7.11).

Per capita spending on security increased 34 percent between 2008 and 2015, from  $196 to$ 262 per capita, for a group of ten countries in the region (Figure 7.12A). While some countries doubled their spending such as Costa Rica (126 percent) and Paraguay (115 percent), others had smaller increases, such as Brazil (19 percent), Honduras (20 percent), and the Dominican Republic (34 percent) (Figure 7.12B).

Per capita spending on security varies significantly among countries. In 2015, Argentina spent  \$583 per capita, compared to\$ 312 by Uruguay,  \$313 by Brazil,\$ 70 by Honduras, and \$32 by Nicaragua (Figure 7.13).

While all countries increased their per capita spending on security, the factors that influenced this increase vary. Economic growth (light green bar in Figure 7.14) played an important role in all countries. The expansion of total public expenditure (orange bar) was positive in eight countries, particularly Paraguay (49 percent), Argentina (36 percent), and Mexico (52 percent). The weight of security spending in total spending (blue bar) increased in seven countries, particularly Costa Rica (32 percent) and Argentina (20 percent), while it fell in two: Brazil (-13.9 percent) and Nicaragua (-12.7 percent) (Figure 7.14).

Although all subsectors enjoyed higher spending during this period, the largest increase in absolute terms was for police, followed by prisons (Figure 7.15A). In relative terms, prisons received the biggest boost (169 per

cent), while criminal justice received the least in absolute and relative terms (Figure 7.15B). In relation to the destination of spending, in the three countries where changes for 2011-2015 could be computed, the relationship between personnel, operations, and investment remained virtually unchanged.

# Can Money Buy Safety?

At first blush, large increases in spending have a weak relationship with security performance indicators in the region (Figures 7.16 and 7.17). Among the countries that boosted their spending above the average between 2010 and 2012, some improved their security indicators above the average between 2012 and 2014 (bottom right quadrant), while others performed worse (top right quadrant). Additionally, while the expected negative relationship exists between changes in victimization and changes in per capita spending on security, the opposite is true for homicides. The underlying methodological challenge is to determine the relationship between these

news because it gives scope for sectoral policy actions to improve impact as the efficiency of spending in the sector increases.

Thus, the evidence reviewed so far suggests that more and better spending on public safety is needed. The magnitude of the security problem in the region, low levels of investment per capita (compared to the OECD), and the probable elasticity of crime in relation to certain inputs (such as the number of police) suggest that more public spending on

security in the region could have positive results. However, before spending more, it is important to analyze how authorities can improve efficiency and effectiveness by spending better.

# Getting More Bang for the Buck

The higher the efficiency level of security institutions, the greater the saving of resources and, therefore, the less spending needed to improve security in the region. How can governments raise the efficiency of security services and improve their quality? A first step is to measure the efficiency of security services in each country with respect to the best country with the same level of inputs. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology calculates the level of efficiency of a country (or region, state, municipality) and its distance in relation to the efficiency frontier, which is determined by the most efficient units. This section presents the first efficiency frontier analysis for Latin American and Caribbean police services. Police services were chosen because they absorb most of the total spending on security. The DEA analysis was applied globally, comparing Latin America and the Caribbean with the world (but will later also be applied at the subnational level).

# Police Efficiency, Global and Regional

Efficiency can be achieved in two ways: doing the same with fewer resources or doing more with the same resources. The first way allows countries to maintain the same level of output using fewer inputs. The second way, which this chapter analyzes, allows countries to maximize outputs using the same inputs.<sup>4</sup> A comparison of Latin American and Caribbean police with the rest of the world gives an average relative efficiency of 70 percent (Figure 7.18), which means that by bringing efficiency to frontier levels, crime prevention in the region could be increased by 30 percent.

Police efficiency is positively correlated with per capita income levels (Figure 7.19). Countries with higher per capita income tend to have greater institutional capacity, which translates into greater efficiency in the use and allocation of resources (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson,

2005). The results highlight the extreme variation in the region; countries with relatively high per capita incomes—such as Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, or Barbados—are less efficient than other countries with similar income levels, such as Brazil, Mexico, or Argentina. Likewise, efficiency goes hand in hand with indicators of institutional capacity such as government effectiveness and rule of law, which indicates that greater efficiency usually comes along with improved institutional capacity (Figure 7.20).

# Context Matters for Efficiency

Police in the region do not act in isolation; they interact constantly with socioeconomic, demographic, and institutional factors in the context in which they operate. Factors related to crime and violence such as poverty, economic inequality, unemployment, the proportion of young people in the population, or rapid urbanization are beyond the control of the police and, consequently, can influence their performance. These factors, therefore, are important to consider when measuring and comparing efficiency in countries with police with different capabilities and different socioeconomic, demographic, and institutional conditions.

After correcting for exogenous factors, differences between countries' degrees of efficiency change and allow a more realistic comparison of performance. Figure 7.21 shows the distribution of Latin American and Caribbean countries in the global sample, with scores adjusted for

exogenous factors. For example, countries such as Barbados and Jamaica, which the previous analysis showed to be inefficient, rise considerably in the efficiency ranking when considering their more difficult socioeconomic situation relative to their peers in the region. The opposite is true of Costa Rica, which falls behind in the ranking when taking into account its better socioeconomic levels. Importantly, although most countries in the region are below median efficiency, they vary widely. Regardless of which efficiency measure is used, some countries in the region, particularly in South America, have efficiency levels above the global median. However, most still have significant room for improvement.

# Spotlighting the Subnational Level

Police efficiency can be measured more accurately when comparing units within the same country (at the subnational level) than when comparing between countries. The institutional, organizational, and cultural differences are easier to measure and control for. Within-country analysis also helps clarify how well police resources are allocated, and their efficiency, in all geographic corners of a country.

This section presents subnational efficiency for five countries.<sup>5</sup> Figure 7.22 provides a wealth of information on the considerable differences in police efficiency between departments or provinces in all countries. The color contrasts, ranging from the darkest (highest efficiency) to the lightest (lowest efficiency) suggest that many different "countries" coexist within the same national borders. Moreover, efficiency is measured within a country, meaning even the most efficient division could probably improve if compared to the international level. Even so, in all countries, police agencies at the provincial level could significantly boost their efficiency with the same level of police inputs with better management. Moving the states or provinces of each country to the frontier would increase police efficiency 66 percent in Ecuador, 62 percent in Honduras, 40 percent in Guatemala, 32 percent in Nicaragua, and 30 percent in Mexico.<sup>6</sup>

# Police Organization and Efficiency

In a region with scant information on the issue, Mexico provides a rare opportunity to examine the effect of types of police organization on efficiency, using information from municipal police forces (Alda, 2018). Half of the municipalities experience reductions in efficiency from the influence of external and internal organizational factors. After controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, the weight of police organization still has an impact on efficiency, though lower than the one from external factors.

In Mexico, the organizational structure of municipal police forces affects the provision of security in two ways. The greater the organizational complexity, the lower the level of efficiency. In particular, the greater

the functional differentiation (larger number of departments or technical units) and spatial differentiation (more stations in the territory), the lower the efficiency. Thus, excessive functional and territorial fragmentation appears to compromise efficiency. In contrast, the greater the organizational control, the higher the efficiency. In particular, the more centralized decision-making is and the more formal and organizational rules and guidelines that exist, the greater the efficiency. These results provide interesting lessons for Mexico and other countries in the region.

# Rewarding Efficiency with Resources

Police efficiency in the region is not—on average—far worse than that of more developed countries at the aggregate level. However, the margins for moving toward the efficiency frontier at the regional, national, and subnational levels are significant. Consequently, resources should be reallocated following an efficiency criterion. At the national level, mechanisms to allocate resources to subnational governments present an opportunity. Many countries do not have a formula for determining where and how to allocate resources more efficiently. Or if they do, they do not use it well. Adopting a performance-based budget that uses efficiency-improvement metrics would help promote better performance and more efficient resource allocation by rewarding municipalities or provinces that improve the use of resources.

# Preventive, Targeted, and Informed Spending

For every additional dollar a government has to protect its citizens, it must make a crucial decision: how can it best use this resource to protect the physical integrity of both its inhabitants and their property? Hire more police officers to increase patrols, raise their pay to increase motivation, equip forensic laboratories to capture more offenders? Invest in social programs to deter young people from embarking on criminal careers or build more prisons to accommodate more offenders for longer? The list is long. Fortunately, the academic literature agrees on three key principles to guide spending on security: preventive rather than reactive and punitive; targeted instead of dispersed; and based on scientific evidence of impact—preferably cost-benefit—instead of intuition.

# Prevention Is Best

Preventing crime not only avoids the suffering of personal and material losses, it is also cheaper than reacting to committed crimes and their

consequences. This is common sense. When a crime is committed, the state activates four key functions on which it must spend public funds: 1) police to pursue and apprehend offenders; 2) justice services to investigate and judge criminals; 3) the sanction system to apply a punishment and promote rehabilitation; and 4) reparation services for damage to victims. This spending adds up and when compared with the cost of preventing a crime, the balance is clearly in favor of prevention. This is even truer after considering the private and social costs of the crime, and the costs of future crimes prevented. For example, intensive tutoring programs for at-risk adolescents, such as "Becoming a Man" in Chicago, resulted in 44 percent fewer arrests for violent crimes (in addition to educational improvements) (Heller et al., 2015). The cost-benefit evaluation awarded a benefit of almost eight dollars for every dollar invested (WSIPP, 2017a).

How much is currently spent on prevention? With no agreed definition of prevention or systems to record this spending, the answer is unclear. One way to measure this spending is to include only programs whose objectives specify the prevention of crime and/or violence. Measured this way, spending on prevention can represent 3 percent of total spending on security and justice, as in El Salvador in 2011 (Figure 7.23), or 10 percent annually in Chile between 2012 and 2015 (Paz Ciudadana Foundation and IDB, 2017).

To more accurately capture prevention spending, the definition should include not only social prevention programs (as in El Salvador and Chile), but also police prevention (such as hot-spot policing) and judicial prevention (such as conciliation or mediation services). Regrettably, systems for recording public accounts are not usually prepared to make these measurements.

Source: World Bank (2012).

An expanded definition of prevention spending should also include programs that may not list prevention among their explicit objectives but promise to help reduce crime in the country. Special programs (Heckman et al., 2010) including those focused on early childhood education, parenting, and school retention, and involving conditional cash transfers, among others, can have important effects on crime prevention if they are well designed. The private and social returns from education in terms of their impact on crime reduction are estimated to exceed 20 percent (Busso et al., 2017).<sup>7</sup>

# Targeting High-Risk Places, People, and Behaviors

The second important metric for evaluating the allocation of security spending pertains to targeting. Crime is disproportionately concentrated in a small number of high-risk places, people, and behaviors (Abt, 2017). The more that security and justice spending targets these three areas, the greater is its impact.

- Places: Some 50 percent of crime is concentrated in 5 percent of street segments in cities in the United States and Europe (Weisburd, 2015) and between 3 percent and 7.5 percent in Latin American cities (Jaitman and Ajzenman, 2016).  
- People: Some 10 percent of the population is responsible for 66 percent of crimes (Martínez et al., 2017). In Boston, 1 percent of young people aged 15 to 24 were responsible for 50 percent of gunshots in the city (Braga and Winship, 2015). In Montevideo, a survey of the adolescent school population revealed that 2 percent are responsible for 70 percent of violent incidents (Trajtenberg and Eisner, 2014). Targeting prolific offenders can prevent more crimes with fewer resources.  
- Behavior: Bearing a firearm, particularly if illegal; alcohol abuse, due to its association with violence; and association with groups of lawbreakers or gangs, increases the probability of committing crimes.[8]

A systematic review of studies on the spatial and criminal concentration of offenders and victims shows a consistent pattern, although the level varies depending on whether crime-free units are included or not. (Figure 7.24).

Measuring the degree of targeting of security spending is complex. To approximate a response, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) conducted a survey in six countries to measure the targeting of citizen security and criminal justice programs. (Table 7.1). The survey found that less than half of these programs are focused on antisocial or criminal risk behaviors (100 programs, or 38 percent of programs). Moreover, targeting is much less common when it comes to high-risk places (12.5 percent).

The analytical methods and programmatic approaches for targeting exist; the challenge is to adopt them. For example, hot-spot policing has been implemented for decades around the world as a way to target high-risk places but has only recently reached the region. Targeted interventions demand the systematic and sustained incorporation of scientific knowledge and crime analysis into decision-making to reduce discretion

and inertia. They also increase the possibility of external control and accountability. Strong political leadership is an essential condition for these changes. The COMPSTAT model in New York, and its adaptations in eight Brazilian states, are good examples of the relevance and challenges of sustained leadership.[9] Effective leadership requires institutional capabilities (good information systems, analytically driven decision-making processes, knowledge of successful interventions, etc.), which take time to build. The region has the opportunity to move toward security policies strongly backed by data and scientific evidence. However, a cultural change is required to create the conditions for adopting a more modern citizen security paradigm.

# Science over Intuition

The third and last metric for evaluating the quality of spending allocation has to do with using practices and programs based on evidence of their impact and a cost-benefit analysis. A robust base of scientific evidence exists on cost-effective interventions to prevent crime and violence, mainly in developed countries. The most prominent online repositories of evidence include **Blueprints for Violence Prevention** of the University of Colorado, *CrimeSolutions* of the National Institute of Justice of the U.S. government, *What Works on Crime Reduction* of the College of Policing of Great Britain, Campbell Collaborations, etc. To make this information more accessible to governments in the region, the IDB is developing a repository with evidence from more than 400 interventions.

Any citizen security policy that aims to spend smartly needs to build and finance a portfolio of interventions based on this global evidence. Achieving this is a gradual and complex process. The first step is to compile global evidence about what works and does not work, and to develop locally adapted interventions and programs based on that knowledge. The second step is to rigorously evaluate their impact and cost-effectiveness, discarding what does not work, scaling up what works, and continuing to test innovative solutions to local problems. At the city level, the University of Chicago Crime Lab is an example of this approach. At the state level, the Washington State Institute of Public Policy (WSIPP), created by the state's congress, stands out for its systematic application of cost-benefit analysis to policy decisions. For each component of the citizen security value chain, the interventions with the best cost-benefit ratio and the highest likelihood of working in the region were selected from the WSIPP repository (Table 7.2). Also included are popular interventions in the region whose cost-benefit is negative.

Regrettably, few programs based on evidence are adopted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Of 283 programs in six countries, only 22 (8 percent) include content or intervention techniques in their design substantiated by empirical evidence of efficacy or cost-effectiveness (Table 7.3).

# Opportunities and Challenges for Spending Better

Preventive, targeted, and evidence-informed interventions have more impact when they are part of a systemic approach that integrates them into each of the three major components of the security and justice value chain: social and urban services, police services, and criminal justice services. Achieving this is not easy. Each component faces obstacles associated with the inertia of the reactive, dispersed, intuitive approach that characterizes much decision-making in Latin America and the Caribbean. This section identifies, for each component, a particular challenge and an example of the type of interventions being implemented in the region to successfully overcome the problem. Putting together an integrated portfolio of interventions that addresses all these issues is perhaps the greatest challenge of all.

# Who's in Charge? Institutional Leadership for Social and Urban Prevention

Smarter spending on social and urban policies meant to promote citizen security requires stronger government leadership. Currently, the social prevention of crime is everyone's and nobody's business. Most countries

lack a clear institutional "champion" that assumes this responsibility as a core part of its agenda and mandate. For different reasons, neither the ministries of social development, education, or health, nor the ministry of security, make it a priority. Consequently, targeted, evidence-informed social programs aimed at crime prevention are scarce and of poor quality. At the same time, interventions with great potential for preventing violence do not have the institutional and budgetary traction needed to adopt and implement them.

A clear example is programs to prevent young people and adolescents from embarking on criminal careers. These programs are some of the most cost-effective interventions in terms of security. Many of them use a proven,

evidence-based approach called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which aims to change an individual's antisocial way of thinking in favor of pro-social and constructive behaviors. CBT is a key ingredient in multiple types of interventions for different age groups, adapted to risk levels. One of its best-known applications is Multisystemic Therapy (MST). MST can reduce the probability of recidivism of an adolescent offender by up to 70 percent after 5 months of treatment in the most complex cases (Sawyer and Borduin, 2011) with net benefits of \$11,000 per participant. Chile is the only Latin American country to implement MST as part of a comprehensive strategy to protect vulnerable children and adolescents (see Box 7.1).

# BOX 7.1 MULTISYSTEMIC THERAPY IN CHILE'S 24 HOUR PROGRAM

Since 2012 Chile has been implementing the "PAIF 24 Horas" program. Weekly, the police send to municipal governments a list of those children and adolescents that have been arrested or taken to police units. Victims of violations of rights are referred to the municipal Office of Protection of Rights and attended by the child protection services network. Cases admitted for law-breaking behavior are referred to a specialized team that applies a brief socio criminal risk assessment to empirically estimate the probability of reoffending. The child's family is invited to participate in a care service whose intensity is proportional to the risk level. The highest risk cases are offered Multisystemic Therapy (MST). This component is financed by the Under-secretariat of Crime Prevention of the Interior Ministry, with the supervision and technical support of the international MST Group. Recently, a quasi-experimental study conducted by the Paz Ciudadana Foundation evaluated the impact of the program. Overall, they found statistically significant reductions in recidivism of 6 percentage points after a one year follow-up. They also found reductions of 6.5 to 13.4 percentage points for the highest-risk subgroup, and of 10.5 to 14 percentage points for young people aged 16 to 18.

Chile's 24 Hour Program incorporated MST thanks to the financial support and technical leadership of the Under-secretariat of Crime Prevention of the Interior Ministry. Smarter spending on citizen security requires identifying and strengthening champions like this; agencies should be capable of promoting a portfolio of evidence-based social and urban prevention programs. Such a portfolio should include both targeted interventions as well as universal programs with important spillover effects on crime prevention.

# Proactive Policing

Smarter spending on police services demands that the region replace its traditional reactive model, based on random patrolling and responding to emergencies, with a proactive approach that anticipates crime and prevents it from happening. To do this, three areas that need proper funding are: crime analysis, to identify the dynamics and concentration of crime (at spatial, individual, and behavioral levels); preventive policing strategies, to preemptively target crime concentration; and police investigation, to catch prolific offenders (Coupe, 2016).

Interventions that reduce opportunities to commit crimes in hot spots are an example of preventive strategies. Hot-spot policing (HSP) deploys police resources to places and at times with high criminal activity (Weisburd and Telep, 2014). A systematic review of 25 rigorous HSP tests found significant reductions in crime in 20 of them (Braga, Papachristos, and Hureau, 2014). Ten of the tests were randomized controlled evaluations. Cost-benefit studies show a return of more than \$5 for every dollar invested.

Although HSP has spread widely in the northern hemisphere, its penetration in Latin America and the Caribbean is still very limited. An IDB survey conducted in 15 countries in the region found that only three have HSP. In Uruguay, impact evaluations already show positive results (see Box 7.2).

HSP in Uruguay is not an isolated initiative, but part of a police reform process that for more than seven years has been moving the police from a reactive model to a more preventive one (Serrano-Berthet, 2018).

# Judging the Justice System

Despite the region's significant investment in criminal justice, high levels of impunity and preventive detention speak to poor performance. The criminal justice system is highly ineffective and inefficient at apprehending and prosecuting offenders, conducting a quick and effective trial, and carrying out sentencing.

# BOX 7.2 HOT-SPOT POLICING: URUGUAY TAKES THE LEAD

In April 2016, the Uruguayan National Police began the High Dedication Operational Program (PADO) as a strategy to reduce violent robberies. The PADO is the first program in Latin America and the Caribbean with a police force dedicated exclusively to patrolling hot spots in Uruguay's main cities. It started in Montevideo where the program deployed patrols in 120 street segments, organized into 28 circuits representing 7 percent of the Montevideo area and accounting for 43 percent of the robberies committed in 2015.

An impact assessment using a difference-in-difference design attributed to the PADO a 22 percent drop in the rate of violent robberies in the areas intervened in during the period.<sup>a</sup> These results are consistent with studies that found a 23 percent reduction in violent crimes in Philadelphia (Ratcliffe et al., 2011) and 20 percent in robberies in Minneapolis (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995). The evaluation of the PADO not only did not find displacement of crime, but a slight diffusion of benefits to nearby areas, which is also consistent with the global empirical literature.

Three out of four (76 percent) homicides in the region go unpunished (Figure 7.25). This is the result of an analysis of homicides and convictions between 2010 and 2015.[10] Unfortunately, the calculation is based on fewer than half the countries in the region, given the lack of information.[11] Comparatively, in Asia and Europe impunity is 30 percent.

Some 41 percent of people imprisoned in the region do not have a sentence and are under the preventive detention regime.[12] Lack of sentencing varies significantly from less than 10 percent in some countries to more than 70 percent in others (Figure 7.26). This is not a new problem. Between 1999 and 2017, the regional average was 44 percent (Figure 7.27). In the last decade, the region introduced important criminal reforms to speed up procedures and trials (Bergman and Fondevila, 2018), which has sparked a downward trend in most cases (Figure 7.28). However, in relative terms, the number of prisoners without conviction remains high.

# BOX 7.3 OBJECTIVE TOOLS FOR DETERMINING PREVENTIVE DETENTION

In the United States, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation developed an analytical tool to provide judges with a scientific, objective, data-driven assessment of the level of risk of the accused and the need for preventive detention. The tool, known as the Public Safety Assessment-Court (PSA-Court), analyzed more than 1.5 million data points taken from the criminal history of the defendants in 300 jurisdictions to identify which factors best predict the probability of committing a new crime, a violent crime, or not appearing in court. The tool only uses data from criminal history, the case for which the defendant is being processed, and age (previous arrests and convictions, failure to appear in court, drug and alcohol use, mental health, etc.). It does not consider race, gender, education, socioeconomic status, or residential data. So far it has been adopted by 38 subnational jurisdictions in the United States and the assessments have had encouraging results (LJAF, 2013).

Similar tools, but used by the police, have been employed in Great Britain to defer or temporarily suspend criminal prosecution for low-risk detainees. Using risk assessment algorithms, the least risky are sent to treatment programs for the problem that led to their arrest. The legal process is not withdrawn but is deferred based on behavior (Neyroud and Slothower, 2015).

Reducing unjustified preventive detention is an obvious way to improve the quality of public spending on citizen security. The main benefit would be for people who are unjustifiably imprisoned, both the guilty who need not be preventatively detained, and (even more) the innocent. However, public spending would also benefit by saving the cost of maintaining people in prison. How can preventive detention be used more judiciously? Preventive detention exists to mitigate three potential risks: harm to the community (level of risk), interference with an investigation, or flight. Unfortunately, most judges in Latin America interpret these three risks subjectively. In developed countries, objective instruments are increasingly being used to assess pre-trial risk, along with use of deferment schemes for criminal prosecution (Box 7.3).

High levels of impunity and preventive detention are related to the low capacity to apprehend and prosecute offenders (effective investigation), as well as to judge and sanction the accused (effective adjudication). The Rule of Law Index<sup>13</sup> prepared by the World Justice Project measures these two indicators (see Figure 7.29). The average of both for the region is a

startlingly low 38 percent, compared to the United States (74 percent) or Spain (70 percent). Again, this measure varies widely in the region.

# Alternatives to Prison

The threat of imprisonment acts as a deterrent to crime not so much because of the severity of the punishment but because of its certainty and speed (Nagin, 2013). Imprisonment, under certain circumstances, can prevent crimes through deterrence and incapacitation. However, its indiscriminate use can lead to situations, as in the United States, where the marginal impact of imprisonment on crime prevention is not significant (Roodman, 2017). To achieve smarter spending on criminal justice services in the region, imprisonment and harsh sentences need to be reserved for the most dangerous offenders, while alternative sanctions apply to nonviolent offenders and low-impact offenses (e.g., for nonviolent crimes committed by people with drug addictions and low-risk profiles). Unfortunately, the region is moving in the opposite direction. Between 2002 and 2014, the penitentiary population of the region (17 countries) doubled from almost 600,000 to 1.2 million, an annual growth rate of 8 percent

and almost six times the population growth rate (1.3 percent). If the prison population continues to grow, by 2030 the region would have in the worst scenario almost 3.4 million people in prison, requiring additional public spending of more than \$13 billion over 2014 prison spending (Figure 7.30).

This significant growth of the prison population arises from two simultaneous tendencies: more people entering prisons than exiting them, and judges handing down longer sentences (Bergman and Fondevila, 2018). Prisoners for drug-related offenses have been the fastest-growing subset in recent years, representing 15 percent to 25 percent of the prison population. This type of prisoner has generally committed relatively minor drug offenses—mostly nonviolent—and represents a significant portion of the female prison population. In Argentina, for example, this group grew from 36 percent in 2003 to 59 percent in 2011, and in Brazil from 25 percent in 2005 to 66 percent in 2012 (Bergman and Fondevila, 2018).

Cost-effective alternatives to imprisonment are needed. Almost a quarter of the population in prison for drug offenses worldwide is charged with consumption—not production, trafficking, or sale of illicit drugs

# BOX 7.4 DRUG TREATMENT COURTS IN CHILE

Since 2004, on a pilot basis, and since 2011 as national public policy, the Chilean Ministry of Justice has been coordinating Drug Treatment Courts (DTCs) with the support of the National Service for Prevention and Rehabilitation of Drug and Alcohol Consumption, Public Prosecutor's Office, Criminal Defense Office, and the judiciary. This program is operating for adults in 29 courts of guarantee in 10 regions of the country and for adolescents in 12 courts of guarantee in eight regions. Between 2008 and 2014, some 1,750 accused people entered the adult DTC program. About 80 percent were men aged 18 to 35. Almost one-third had committed crimes against the drug law, 20 percent battery, 10 percent theft, and 25 percent crimes of domestic violence. The Paz Ciudadana Foundation, with the IDB's support, carried out the first impact assessment and cost-benefit study in the Latin American context. The assessment is retrospective, quasi-experimental, and measures the criminal recidivism of participants. Impact results show that during the first 12 months after admission, the program reduced criminal recidivism by 8.7 percentage points.

(UNODC, 2016: 102). Addiction can make people act irrationally and illegally or commit a crime to finance their addiction. Passing through jail significantly increases (rather than decreases) the possibility of reoffending, is a very expensive option for the state budget, and can aggravate instead of reduce problematic drug use. Therefore, it is imperative to explore alternative penalties that are less costly for the state and better address problematic drug use.

One alternative is Drug Treatment Courts (DTCs). These specialized courts link subjects that have broken criminal law to an alternative mechanism to the traditional criminal process. They not only send offenders for treatment, but also include intensive judicial supervision that increases user adherence and facilitates the process of change. DTCs can reduce criminal recidivism from traditional prosecution of drug-related crimes by 8 to 12 percentage points. Cost-benefit studies show a social return of \(2.84 for each dollar invested.[14] DTCs are popular in the United States, where there are more than 2,000 DTCs serving more than 70,000 people (Kleiman, Caulkins, and Hawken, 2011). In Latin America, Chile is the country with most experience in the area, although other countries in the region also have experiences of varying scope (CICAD, 2015) (see Box 7.4).

# Implementation: Triggering Reform

To spend better, priority must be given to a more preventive, targeted, and evidence-based portfolio of interventions. At the same time, the efficiency of the police and other agencies in the sector must be improved. Implementing these changes involves many reforms, big and small, easy and difficult. Each country will set the pace and ambition of its reforms. Two systemic and interrelated challenges—one, political, and the other, institutional—need to be addressed for reforms to move forward.

# A New Message for Security

The political challenge is to make smart spending on citizen security politically attractive. Many of the reforms proposed in this chapter will not stir up massive support from the public. The pain and fear caused by violence and crime means that the loudest voices in the public space generally speak of repression rather than prevention, revenge rather than justice, punishment rather than remedial penalties. Between 2012 and 2014, the proportion of Latin Americans who prioritized punitive measures increased from 47 percent to 55 percent, while those that prioritized prevention fell from 37 percent to 30 percent (Figure 7.31). Although attitudes vary from country to country, the punitive bent has gained ground in all countries.

This chapter opened with a plea to promote a third way between the "iron fist" and "structural causes of crime" approaches. This third, more pragmatic and scientific way, combines punitive and preventive elements that have been scientifically proven to impact crime. This alternative approach must be communicated in a manner that mobilizes decision-makers, researchers, and civil society into a coalition in favor of smart spending on citizen security. The "smart on crime" movement in the United States is an example of this. It used evidence on the high fiscal cost and ineffectiveness of punitive measures to propose and implement reforms to reduce the excessive punitiveness of the U.S. criminal justice system (Box 7.5).

Getting this message across requires institutional advocates who can effectively communicate what smarter spending on security means. Identifying and enabling these advocates is the institutional challenge. They can come from government, academia, civil society, and/or the private sector. References, inside and outside the region, can serve as examples and inspiration:

# BOX 7.5 MONEY MATTERS: FISCAL PRUDENCE AND NONPUNITIVE REFORMS IN THE UNITED STATES

According to a recent study, the Great Recession of 2008 in the United States contributed to increase political and public support for nonpunitive reforms in its criminal justice system. In 2009, for the first time in 37 years, the total number of people in prison declined in that country. Since then, the trend has deepened and many states, some with a strong punitive tradition, have begun to abolish or place a moratorium on the death penalty, close prisons and open smaller detention centers, reduce use of solitary confinement, and legalize recreational use of marijuana, among other nonpunitive measures.

The financial crisis inspired a new policy discourse that emphasized costs, frugality, and fiscal prudence, becoming a powerful force in political campaigns and negotiations on public policies. Punitive preferences of the public did not change, but a new message focused on the cost of the reforms emerged, leading to agreements on criminal policy issues that were previously very difficult to obtain, particularly on prison policy. The most frequently used arguments related to the need for improving the quality of criminal justice public spending, replacing punitive correctional policies with low returns for reducing recidivism, with measures to protect citizens, such as imprisoning high-risk offenders and strengthening police investigation to solve violent crimes. These are neutral arguments which neither demonize nor humanize offenders; instead, they show the unproductive cost of poorly designed prosecution and imprisonment policies.

- Civil society: The Brazilian Public Security Forum is a wide and loose network of academics, leaders of nongovernmental organizations, police officers, prosecutors, judges, and security officials from all over Brazil who—through research, information and advocacy campaigns, and discussion forums—influence smarter security policy and spending. Professional associations, such as the College of Policing of Great Britain and the International Association of Police Chiefs, also play a useful role in actively promoting greater coordination between practitioners and academics.
- Government: The WSIPP, created by the Washington State Congress, produces cost-effective analyses that regularly inform the state's security budget; and has been used to justify reallocation resources from building new prisons into programs to reduce criminal recidivism.
- Academia: The University of Chicago Crime Lab partners with the city government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to carefully craft innovative crime and violence reduction initiatives, which are rigorously evaluated, and scaled up if found effective through highly visible programs.
- **Private sector:** Through instruments such as social impact bonds, the private sector finances innovative results-based initiatives which can improve the quality of public spending. The United Kingdom's Peterborough social impact bond, the first in the world, succeeded in reducing reoffending by 9 percent, against a Ministry of Justice target of 7.5 percent, allowing private investors who had funded the service provider to be fully repaid with a 3 percent per annum return (Ainsworth, 2017).

Enabling smart-on-crime advocates to emerge can be done in multiple ways. Improving the infrastructure and quality of data should be at the top of the list—data for targeting high-risk places, people, and behaviors; for measuring the cost-benefit ratio of interventions; for comparing the relative efficiency of police, justice, or prison services; among others.

The advocates for better spending may vary in each country. What should not vary is the effort to spend better. For many Latin Americans, it can be the difference between living or dying, between living with or without fear, between escaping crime or being trapped in it. Much of what needs to be done to spend better is already known. What is missing is a powerful institutional framework to put that knowledge into action.

# Efficient Spending for Healthier Lives

Health systems have been a crucial driver of progress in health and well-being in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since 2000, large improvements in the coverage of skilled birth attendance and immunizations testify to citizens' expanded access to vital health services. These achievements have paid off in terms of better health outcomes, as measured by the increase in life expectancy or the decline in mortality rates of children under five years of age. Nevertheless, much is left to be done to address unmet needs and health inequities as well as to shift the focus of care toward chronic illness, which currently accounts for nearly three-fourths of deaths and years of life lost due to premature death and disability.

The case for continued investment in health is strong. Spurred by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda, Latin American and Caribbean countries are implementing policies and programs aimed at achieving universal health coverage (UHC)—that is, ensuring that all people can obtain the services they need without suffering financial hardship (WHO, 2010b). The commitment to ensure affordable access to high-quality health services for all requires that governments examine whether progress toward UHC can be met with current levels of health system investment and, if macroeconomic conditions allow, to mobilize additional resources and increase the fiscal space for health.

Yet, as presented in Chapter 1, many countries in the region anticipate further budgetary restrictions. Consequently, policy must focus on improving the efficiency of health care by investing in interventions that achieve the best health results and implementing these interventions the right way. Attaining universal health care will require not just more money for health, but more health per dollar invested.

# What Is Efficiency and Why Does It Matter?

Production of health services involves using inputs—funding, human resources, physical infrastructure, drugs, medical equipment, and information—to improve health outcomes. Two dimensions of efficiency are commonly used to examine this production function: allocative and technical. The former pertains to "doing the right things." This is achieved by allocating resources to the combination of health-care services which delivers the largest gain in health outcomes for a given total expenditure or requires the smallest expenditure for a given improvement in health. This is what is usually meant by "getting value for money" in health care. Allocative inefficiency may arise from inadequate priority-setting, lack of clinical guidelines, incomplete performance reporting or, simply, inadequate governance of the system (Smith, 2016).

Technical efficiency refers to achieving the maximum level of output(s) for a given amount of input(s) under the prevailing technological process. It is "doing things the right way," which is achieved when outputs are produced with the least possible use of inputs. Technical inefficiency arises from misusing inputs in the process of producing valued outputs. Wasting inputs at any stage of the production process means that output will fall short of what is possible for a given level of resources. This is the case when tests are duplicated, avoidable readmissions take place, hospital stays are prolonged beyond need, or when unit costs could be lower. Technical inefficiency arises most notably at the provider and practitioner level—but is also present at the institutional level—and may result from inappropriate incentives, weak or constrained management, and inadequate information.

In the health sector, either type of inefficiency is a concern for several reasons. First, patients may not receive the best possible care for a given level of resources. Second, consuming excess resources robs treatment possibilities and health gains from other patients. Third, inefficient use of resources for health may sacrifice consumption opportunities elsewhere in the economy, such as in education. And finally, waste resulting from inefficient care may reduce society's willingness to contribute to the funding of health services, thereby harming social solidarity, health system performance, and social welfare (Smith, 2012).

# Health Care Spending in the Region: Taking the Vital Signs

Between 1995 and 2014, Latin America and the Caribbean's total health expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased from 6.3 percent to 7.2 percent such that the average level of total health expenditure per

capita<sup>1</sup> at the end of the period was \$1,109 (see Figure 8.1).<sup>2</sup> These levels are lower than the average \$4,701 per capita, or 12.3 percent of GDP, spent in the OECD in 2014 (GHED, 2017), and variation is wide, from 4.8 percent in Argentina to 11.1 percent in Cuba.

Average public health spending as a percent of total health expenditure in the region increased from 47.4 percent to 57 percent, and in 2014 was the largest financing source for health. In 2014 the value of public spending was on average 3.7 percent of GDP, which falls below a recommended threshold of 5 percent to support minimum standards of service (Meheus and McIntyre, 2017; Ooms and Hammonds, 2014). However, there is much heterogeneity in the region: public health spending ranged from 1.5 percent of GDP in Venezuela, to 6.7 percent and 10.5 percent in Costa Rica and Cuba, respectively, in 2014.

Although the level of spending is important for health outcomes, so too are the sources of funding, particularly when it comes to analyzing the financial protection of individuals using the health system (Moreno-Serra, Millet, and Smith, 2011). Total health expenditure can be decomposed by its financing agents into public (general government, including social security), prepaid private (i.e., voluntary health insurance), and out of pocket (i.e., the amount paid by individuals out of their own pocket on top of

any amounts paid for insurance). The sum of public and prepaid private spending is known as prepaid pooled spending. $^3$  In the broader context of the push for universal health care and progress toward the SDGs, pooled prepaid health expenditure is particularly relevant, as it indicates the prepaid resources that a nation directly devotes to financial risk protection and effective access to health services. Pooled funds have been shown to be causally linked to improvements in access and public health at the cross-country level (Moreno-Serra and Smith, 2012a). Latin America and the Caribbean's total health expenditure composition in 2014 is shown in Figure 8.2, ordering countries from highest to lowest in terms of pooled prepaid expenditure.

Out-of-pocket expenditure is a key indicator of financial protection. Levels above 20 percent of total health expenditure are strongly associated with catastrophic and impoverishing spending (Xu et al., 2010) and

indicate the stress households face in accessing health care. Although the share of out-of-pocket spending in the region has decreased from 37 percent to 33 percent, it still almost doubles that of OECD countries (18 percent) and is higher than the recommended limit of 20 percent for most countries. Out-of-pocket spending was as high as 64 percent and 52 percent in Venezuela and Guatemala, respectively, and only four countries are at or below the recommended limit (Colombia, Suriname, Uruguay, and Cuba).

Total private expenditure (prepaid private and out of pocket) accounts for a higher share in countries where the fiscal capacity to pool public funds is low. On average, it reached 43 percent of total health expenditure in 2014 for Latin American and Caribbean countries, which is above the 38 percent average in the OECD. Overall, prepaid private spending comprises the smallest source of health spending in the region ( \$122 per capita or 11 percent of total health expenditure in 2014 compared to\$ 57 per capita and 13 percent in 1995) although in countries like Haiti and Suriname it was as high as 45 percent and 37 percent of total health expenditure, respectively, in 2014.

The weight of public health expenditure in primary government spending may indicate the priority placed on health in the public budget. While the ratio in several countries has remained the same since the 1990s (e.g., Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador), in others it has either increased (as in Paraguay) or decreased (as in Argentina). At the regional level, public health expenditure has remained around 16 percent of primary government spending (Figure 8.3).

For the foreseeable future, health expenditures are expected to continue to climb, driven by factors such as population aging, the rising incidence of chronic diseases, socioeconomic improvements and an associated greater demand for health services, as well as the adoption of technological developments (de la Maisonneuve and Oliveira Martins, 2013). These trends strengthen the case for seeking greater efficiency in public health-care spending.

# Efficiency of Latin American and Caribbean Health Systems: Limping Along

Efficiency metrics to assess health system reform and policy interventions are critical to support sound decision-making. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of the sources and magnitude of inefficiency in health spending in Latin America and the Caribbean, leaving policymakers in the dark when deciding where to direct efforts for improvement. To begin filling

this information void, this section provides evidence on how Latin American and Caribbean countries are doing in terms of the efficiency of public health spending from a comparative, regional system perspective, as well as at the microeconomic level.

# An Aggregate Perspective

This chapter measures the efficiency levels of Latin American and Caribbean health systems and their possible determinants using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is useful for identifying which countries do better than others in transforming health resources into better outputs. DEA also pinpoints specific areas for policy action in each health system by highlighting areas in which a country is doing worse than its peers.

This is the first cross-country analysis of health system efficiency available for the entire region, partially due to the limited availability and comparability of health data. Although in Latin America and the Caribbean

DEA has been used mostly at the single country level,[4] the World Health Organization (WHO) and the OECD increasingly use DEA models to compare health system efficiency across countries.

This chapter uses DEA models to benchmark the efficiency of Latin American and Caribbean health systems using middle-income countries (MICs) and OECD countries for comparison. Efficiency performance was measured for eight health system outputs, grouped in three categories (health: life expectancy at birth and at age 60, under-five mortality, and Disability Adjusted Life Years [DALYs];<sup>5</sup> access to services: DPT immunization, and skilled birth attendance [SBA] rates; equity of access to services: rural-vs-urban and poorest-vs-richest ratios of SBA). The main input to the models was pooled prepaid health expenditure per capita.<sup>6</sup>

A country's ability to maximize the impact of inputs on outputs may be affected by factors external to the health system, such as a country's economic and social development or demographic structure. Therefore, GDP per capita and the share of the population aged 65 and above were included as control variables. Unfortunately, lifestyle indicators (e.g., smoking prevalence,[7] alcohol consumption, diet patterns), environmental factors (e.g., air pollution)[8] quality of services, and other factors that might affect the impact of inputs on outputs were not considered due to limited cross-country data.[9]

Note: Life expectancy was calculated averaging data between 2011 and 2015, while health expenditure was calculated averaging data between 2006 and 2010.

Efficiency is measured, for any given level of inputs, as a country's output relative to an efficiency frontier that sets the upper limit of countries' output. Countries on the efficiency frontier are, therefore, considered the most efficient for their level of health spending. For example, Figure 8.4 shows the DEA efficiency frontier for a key output indicator: life expectancy at birth. The curve linking the most efficient countries (Cameroon, India, Vietnam, Chile, the Republic of Korea, Israel, and Japan) for different levels of pooled health expenditure constitutes the frontier against which all other countries are compared. As expected, OECD countries are the efficiency peers of Latin American and Caribbean countries in only very few instances (e.g., Korea and Israel), given their typically higher input levels (especially health expenditures and national income). Most peers are within the Latin American and Caribbean region itself or are good-performing MICs at different levels of inputs (e.g., Vietnam).

A first message of the DEA analyses is that Latin American and Caribbean countries vary widely in terms of spending efficiency (see Table 8.1). Chile is the only Latin American country among the top 25 percent of performers (8th); OECD countries occupy most of the top 25 percent. Chile's high health system efficiency is explained by its consistently positive health outcomes (life expectancy at birth, under-five mortality, and DALYs lost) from its inputs. Other relatively good regional performers are Barbados (29th), Costa Rica (31st), Cuba (32nd), and Uruguay (35th), all of whom are in the top half of the average efficiency scores. Barbados and Cuba exhibit

Source: Authors' calculation based on World Bank World Development Indicators Database, WHO Global Health Observatory data repository, and UNICEF data. Note: Based on 2006-2015 data. Best-performing countries for each output indicator, given their level of spending, receive an efficiency score of 1. Countries that receive a score below 1 are considered less efficient. For example, if country A has an efficiency score of 0.87, it is performing at a level of 87 percent compared to a country with the highest efficiency score. Average efficiency scores for each output indicator have been computed by averaging the results of three alternative DEA models using an "output orientation" specification: model 1 includes pooled health expenditure per capita as the sole input; model 2 includes pooled health spending per capita and GDP per capita as inputs; model 3 includes pooled health spending per capita, GDP per capita, and population aged 65 and above as inputs. Missing values are marked as "—". The table does not display the scores of middle-income countries. However, the ranking positions take these into account.

good efficiency performance by producing wider and equitable access to health services.

However, 22 of 27 Latin American and Caribbean countries are in the bottom half of the average efficiency rankings, and 12 are in the bottom 25 percent. Underperformers across each of the eight outputs are Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Panama, and Suriname. In general, Latin American and Caribbean countries perform particularly less efficiently in the provision of equitable access to services.

Head-to-head comparisons between Latin American and Caribbean countries with similar levels of pooled health expenditure (peers) can help identify specific areas for efficiency improvements. Figure 8.5A compares relatively high-spending countries: Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica. Conversely, Figure 8.5B compares low-spending countries: Bolivia, Guyana, and Nicaragua. Among high spenders, Brazil approximates Chile's efficiency levels for service access indicators more than for health outcomes, while Costa Rica has better health outcomes than access to care. Among low spenders, efficiency bottlenecks in health outcomes achieved are clearly the main issue in Guyana, whereas Bolivia needs to improve both service coverage and health outcomes.

A key message is that there is room for efficiency improvements in the region. Latin American and Caribbean countries are on average less efficient than the OECD group for every DEA output considered (see Figure 8.6). Moreover, Latin American and Caribbean countries are as inefficient as the MIC group in providing equitable access to services. On the positive side, Latin America and the Caribbean outperforms MICs for most health outcomes, and efficiency performance is relatively close to that of the OECD for life expectancy at age 60 and under-five mortality rate. This does not mean that they have the same outcomes as OECD countries, but rather, that they are as efficient as OECD countries given their level of development and amount of resources spent.

This analysis suggests that several Latin American and Caribbean countries could substantially improve health output indicators while keeping their current health budget stable, if they could boost efficiency to the frontier (Table 8.2). For example, average life expectancy could be extended by four years, or 5.4 percent. Potential gains in life expectancy reach at least seven additional years in Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Under-five mortality could be reduced by 10 deaths per 1,000 or 46.5 percent, with potential cuts of more than 24 deaths per 1,000 live births in Guyana and Bolivia. DALYs lost for all causes could be reduced on average by 6,143 per 100,000 people or 19.1 percent. Regarding access to services, skilled birth attendance could be improved by 4.4

percentage points (from 91.9 percent to 96.3 percent), and reach as much as 22 percentage points in low-performing countries like Guatemala. DPT immunization rates could improve by 7 percentage points (from 89.9 percent to 96.9 percent) and about 14 percentage points in low performers like Panama and Venezuela. The message to policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean is clear: improving spending efficiency can contribute to healthier lives without compromising additional resources.

# The DNA of Health System Efficiency

What characteristics of a health system determine its efficiency? What accounts for the differences in efficiency among countries? Characteristics of health systems resulting from policy choices are of particular interest to policymakers because they are within their control. For example, studies in higher-income countries show that higher efficiency scores are associated with fewer insurers (Hadad, Hadad, and Simon-Tuval, 2013), health service delivery models in which primary care physicians act as gatekeepers (Bhat, 2005), and decentralized health systems (de la Maisonneuve et al., 2016).<sup>10</sup>

This chapter represents the first attempt to provide evidence on the determinants of health system efficiency related to policy choices in Latin America and the Caribbean. Simar-Wilson cross-sectional regressions were used to estimate the association between countries' DEA efficiency scores in health outcomes, access to services, and equity, and three sets of potential determinants related to policy choices for which data were available: 1) organization of health-care financing and delivery, measured by out-of-pocket

Note: Potential gains for each output indicator have been computed by averaging the results of three alternative DEA models using an "output orientation" specification: model 1 includes pooled health expenditure per capita as the sole input; model 2 includes pooled health spending per capita and GDP per capita as inputs; model 3 includes pooled health spending per capita, GDP per capita, and population aged 65 and above as inputs. Based on 2006-2015 data.

health expenditure as a share of total health expenditure, and hospital beds per 1,000 people; 2) quality of health system institutions, measured by the existence of a medium-term sectoral vision, as well as the ability to set and monitor plans and objectives; and 3) quality of governance, proxied by six governance indicators and their average, including government effectiveness, voice and accountability, rule of law, regulatory quality, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, and control of corruption.[11]

Health outcomes. In three models—life expectancy at birth, life expectancy at age 60 and, most strongly, under-five mortality—better governance is linked to better health outcomes. Higher-quality health system institutions—measured by the medium-term sectoral vision indicator—are also linked to greater efficiency in lowering under-five mortality rates. Health-care financing and delivery does not seem to affect efficiency scores.

Access to services. Efficiency in providing access to services (DPT immunization) is positively associated with the quality of governance. Service coverage (both skilled birth attendance and DPT immunization) is also positively associated with the quality of health system institutions, specifically the existence of a medium-term sectoral plan.

Equity in access to services. Better governance also improves efficiency in providing equitable access to health services (measured by poorest/richest and rural/urban ratios of skilled birth attendance). On the other hand, health system institutional quality is not associated with equity.

Overall, better governance and health system institutional quality likely affect the efficiency with which countries translate a given health budget into better population health outcomes, access to services, and equity in access to services. However, more analysis is needed to determine causation.

# The Micro Perspective: Pharmaceutical Policy and Health Service Delivery

In 2010, the World Health Report estimated that 20-40 percent of all resources spent on health are wasted (WHO, 2010b). Among the major sources of technical inefficiency it identified were an inadequate or costly mix of health workers, high prices, substandard quality and misuse of medicines, suboptimal quality and scale of health-care services, over-use

of health-care products, and leakages due to corruption and fraud (see Table 8.3). The report also pointed out that the primary source of allocative inefficiency relates to investments in services and interventions that do not maximize health improvements, such as spending more on curative care for chronic diseases rather than on preventive measures.

Evidence of inefficiency is presented in two key areas: pharmaceutical policy and health-care service delivery (rows 2 and 4 of Table 8.3) Improved efficiency in these areas would likely produce large gains because 1) seven of the ten top sources of inefficiency in health care worldwide originate from them, 2) they are key areas for attaining universal health coverage, and 3) growing international experience provides reliable evidence of strategies that work to address efficiency concerns in these areas.

# Pharmaceutical Spending and Medication Use: A Dose of Common Sense

Pharmaceutical spending represents a significant share of health-care budgets. In OECD countries, one of every five health dollars is spent on medicines (Belloni, Morgan, and Paris, 2016). Trends in pharmaceutical spending influence overall health spending patterns. This is particularly relevant for Latin America and the Caribbean, where pharmaceutical spending has grown around 12 percent annually from 2013 to 2017, four times faster than in North America and six times faster than in Europe (Global Health Intelligence, 2014). Sound pharmaceutical policies are crucial not only to curb this trend, but also to improve value for money, as four of the ten leading sources of inefficiency in health spending are related to medicines (Table 8.3).

A unique repository of comparative information shared by Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, and Peru, denominated "Decisiones Informadas Sobre Medicamentos de Alto Impacto Financiero" (DIME), is used as the source to explore pharmaceutical policies to promote efficiency as well as to consider the use of two medicines—ertapenem and insulin glargine—to explore inefficiencies in the procurement and use of medicines in these countries.[12] Of key international recommended policies (Belloni, Morgan, and Paris 2016; Vogler and Schmickl, 2010), Table 8.4 shows those adopted by DIME countries.[13]

Policies to control prices include price regulation and mechanisms for centralized negotiation and purchase of medicines (see Table 8.4). Regarding price regulation, Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador have adopted International Reference Pricing (IRP) systems. For example, Colombia benchmarks prices with 17 countries and adopts the price of the lowest 25th percentile. An initial evaluation of the Colombian IRP concluded that the average price of medicines adopting IRP decreased by 40 percent (Andia et al., 2014; Prada et al., 2018). El Salvador's IRP uses as reference the average price of Latin American countries (excluding Central America and Panama).[14] Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, and the Dominican Republic did not adopt IRP systems, limiting potential efficiency gains. In Mexico, however, the Secretariat of Economy establishes a maximum price for medicines for the general population. All DIME countries implement mechanisms for centralized negotiation and purchase of medicines, which help reduce prices by giving governments greater bargaining power and strengthening logistical processes while minimizing low-value repetitive purchases.

Under-use of generic drugs is another major source of inefficiency. Generic drugs have the same effect (bioequivalence) as brand products but generally cost less (Belloni, Morgan, and Paris, 2016). For example, among five commonly used medicines, the price difference between brand products and generics was as high as 41 percent (Singal, Nanda,

and Kotwani, 2011). Non-use of generics is thus inefficient since the same clinical benefits can be achieved with fewer resources. Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Mexico provide incentives to produce or register generics (Table 8.4). Colombia applies lower tariffs, Mexico offers tax exemptions, Ecuador simplifies paperwork, and El Salvador financially supports technological upgrades in small and medium pharmaceutical companies that produce generics, and favors the adoption of international quality standards. Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador also offer abbreviated registration processes for generics. According to DIME data, despite the potential gains, countries like Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, and the Dominican Republic have not yet enacted policies promoting generics.

In terms of rational use of medicines, this concept stands on the premise that "patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community" (Holloway and van Dijk, 2011). Irrational use includes prescribing multiple medicines per patient ("poly-pharmacy"), failure to prescribe according to clinical guidelines, inappropriate self-medication, and non-adherence to dosing protocols (Holloway and van Dijk, 2011). Regarding policies to favor rational prescription, none of the DIME countries provide doctors or pharmacies with financial incentives. Colombia has made isolated efforts to detect and notify off-label use of medicines[15] using an e-prescription platform that identifies this practice. Off-label prescriptions are reimbursed only if evidence of benefits is provided.[16] On a positive note, all DIME countries adopt international non-proprietary names (INNs). An INN identifies a pharmaceutical active ingredient by a unique name that is public property and globally recognized (WHO, 2017a). INN prescription, labeling, and marketing promote more rational use of medicines by establishing international standards in pharmaceutical products and encouraging the use of generics (Vogler, 2012).

Inappropriate use of drugs is common, as illustrated by the use of insulin glargine and ertapenem in a sample of Latin American countries. Insulin glargine is used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 9 out of 100 persons suffer from diabetes, and by 2040 this number is expected to reach almost 12 in 100, placing diabetes among the top causes of disease and premature death in the region (IDF, 2017). Thus, public budgets should allocate resources to medications that maximize health outcomes at low cost. However, the cost of treatment per patient per year with insulin glargine may be 120 percent higher than that of human insulin, which has the same clinical benefit (Hua et al., 2016; Sánchez Choez et al., 2015; Machado-Alba, Medina-Morales, and Echeverri-Cataño, 2016).

A similar efficiency issue arises with ertapenem, an antibiotic indicated to treat in-hospital bacterial infections. Ertapenem is not recommended as the first line of treatment since there are much cheaper drugs with the same clinical effect.[17] Therefore, its use should be restricted to ensure availability

of effective second-line therapy if first-line antibiotics fail. Neither insulin glargine nor ertapenem are on the WHO list of essential medicines (WHO, 2017b). Consequently, their use is potentially inefficient, as it is not the lowest cost treatment for the patient.

Table 8.5 summarizes information on expenditure per capita on ertapenem in DIME countries, as well as the presence—or absence—of three policy options to control its use: inclusion in a public formulary (coverage), use of a local health technology assessment (HTA), and development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). $^{18}$  It shows that expenditure per capita on ertapenem in Colombia is about 16 times higher than in Costa Rica and 12 times higher than in Peru. Countries that spend the most on ertapenem (Chile and Colombia) cover the drug through exceptional mechanisms, meaning that prescriptions are allowed for exceptional situations, such as legal claims and case-by-case approval of use by medical committees. Yet, what differentiates Chile and Colombia from low spenders like Costa Rica and Peru is that they have not carried out local technology assessments, or developed CPGs

for ertapenem, while the low spenders have HTAs, and Costa Rica also has CPGs in place.

Table 8.6 shows similar information for insulin glargine. Here, a key beneficial policy is followed by El Salvador and Ecuador, two countries with a zero-insulin glargine policy, where human insulin is used instead. In the case of Ecuador, expenditure on insulin glargine is  \$0.05 per capita, in contrast to\$ 734.11 spent in Colombia or \$204.25 spent in Chile. Given that the cost of treatment per patient per year with insulin glargine may be 120 percent higher than that of human insulin, countries like Colombia and Chile could be saving considerably by switching to human insulin in their drug protocols.

Four countries that provide public coverage for glargine insulin (Colombia, Mexico, Chile, and Peru) experience the highest levels of spending. In Colombia, an analysis of insulin glargine expenditure over time confirmed that its take-off occurred right after its inclusion in the Colombian benefits plan. Interestingly, among high spenders, Colombia and Mexico implemented complementary measures to control insulin expenditure (technology assessment and CPGs), yet expenditure levels per capita are still high, implying that the existence of control tools is not enough; the quality of their implementation matters, too.

Both cases suggest that switching from ertapenem and glargine insulin to their lower-priced substitutes is likely to release additional public resources to serve a larger number of patients. From a policy perspective,

better articulation of policy action on medicines is needed, as coverage decisions that are not backed up and reinforced by rigorous technology assessments and CPGs may compromise efficiency.

# Quality of Preventive Services: Cuts Are Costly

Delivery of timely, high-quality diagnostic and treatment services in primary care has been shown to prevent acute deterioration, progression, or complications in people with disease (Manns et al., 2012). In addition, proactive disease management in primary care may help contain health-care spending by reducing, or even avoiding, the need for more expensive emergency visits, hospitalizations, or complex procedures (Rosano et al., 2013; Guanais and Macinko, 2009).<sup>19</sup> Under-use of primary care interventions results in both suboptimal quality of care and inefficiency; not only is people's health compromised, but opportunities for savings are missed. The Colombian primary care system's provision of preventive exams for diabetes is a case in point.

Diabetes constitutes a major burden of disease in Colombia. Health services to manage the condition are covered by publicly funded health insurance coverage, which relies on health insurers known as Empresas Promotoras de Salud (EPS) to organize delivery at the primary care level. To promote effective diabetes care, the Colombian Ministry of Health developed national CPGs based on best international recommendations (Aschner et al., 2016; American Diabetes Association, 2016). Compliance with these CPGs is key for improving patient outcomes and avoiding unnecessary costs, since major complications of diabetes (coronary and vascular diseases, renal failure, neuropathies, amputations), as well as mortality, can be prevented or reduced by monitoring blood pressure, blood glucose (HbA1c), cholesterol, and kidney function, through outpatient visits and diagnostic testing.[20]

An analysis of compliance with CPGs for 324,000 diabetic patients affiliated with EPSs of the health insurance contributory regime<sup>21</sup> reveals that striking under-provision of appropriate preventive services leads to poor outcomes and costlier care (Buitrago, Ruiz, and Rincón 2018). Only 15 percent of the diabetic population was provided all recommended tests, including

yearly blood glucose, cholesterol, and kidney function tests. Even more striking is the variation in compliance across regions (see Figures 8.7 and 8.8).

Compliance also varies by EPS provider. Table 8.7 shows large breaches in compliance for all tests—cholesterol being the most notable—as well as substantial variation across providers. For example, complete testing compliance varies from 27 percent for the best EPS provider to nearly zero for the worst. Thus, efficiency is not only about the average level of prevention, but also about homogeneous provision across regions and providers.

Proper prevention policies for individuals with diabetes may help them avoid costly intensive care episodes as well as dialysis, revascularization, amputations, and even death. Results of detailed econometric analyses indicate how HbA1c, kidney function, and cholesterol tests can reduce these undesirable patient outcomes (see Buitrago, Ruiz, and Rincón 2018, for details). Results also indicate that the larger the number of different providers a patient visits (which is a proxy for fragmentation of care, another source of inefficiency), the worse are the outcomes.

Compliance with required tests could generate substantial efficiency gains by lowering the probability of all complications, thereby cutting the costs of treatment through prevention. Take the case of HbA1c tests, the most important intervention for diabetes control.

Table 8.8 splits costs between those who followed complete HbA1c monitoring and those who did not. Data on the role of HbA1c tests in avoiding bad outcomes, together with information on costs, allows for an estimation of the marginal effect of compliance with HbA1c on costs. Complete HbA1c monitoring lowers the yearly total cost per patient by  \$430 on average. In this sample, if the 187,585 patients who did not undergo complete HbA1c testing did so, net savings of at least\$ 80.7 million could be achieved (15 percent of total costs). Considering that the total value of premiums paid to EPS in 2015 was about US\$5.968 billion, these savings alone, based on full testing for HbA1c levels could have reduced about 1.3 percent of total expenditures. Even though administering more HbA1c tests raises outpatient costs, it prevents much costlier expenditures for

patients who do not receive complete Hb1Ac tests and therefore may face further complications.

Thus, shortcuts in quality of care, in the form of unsatisfactory adherence to preventive testing, can negatively impact the efficient use of resources in Colombia. Databases like the one used in this study can be further exploited to guide improvement efforts, such as the use of CPGs to improve results for diabetic patients (Box 8.1).

# Policy Prescriptions

At the international level, policy options to improve efficiency address the supply side, demand side, public management, coordination, and financing of health systems (de la Maisonneuve et al., 2016; Moreno-Serra, 2014). This chapter focuses on governance and quality of institutions, pharmaceutical policies, priority setting, and reconfiguration of health services.

# BOX 8.1 BIG DATA TO INFORM ALLOCATION DECISIONS

Large administrative and clinical databases can help evaluate health program performance in LAC. Advanced statistical tools (targeted learning) were applied to diabetic patient "big data" from the DIABETIMMS program in Mexico City and Mexico state to examine differences in the control of patient blood glucose. Clinics following the practice guidelines of the DIABETIMMS program were compared against clinics with "business as usual" practices (Hubbard, 2018). DIABETIMMS clinics achieve far better results. Had this program been applied to all clinics in the studied sample, about 5,000 additional patients would have achieved lower blood glucose levels. Furthermore, using a precision public health methodology, predictions can determine which subset of the diabetic population would benefit most from DIABETIMMS, thus facilitating targeting resources for a more efficient allocation.

# Governance and Quality of Institutions

Government effectiveness, transparency, citizen participation in policymaking, and regulatory quality likely impact favorably on the functioning and efficiency of the public sector (Wagstaff and Claeson, 2004), which plays a pivotal role in the organization and operation of most health systems in Latin America and the Caribbean. The relatively efficient performance of health systems in Costa Rica, Chile, and Uruguay may be related to improvements in public sector regulation, transparency, and accountability to citizens. These countries have developed e-government systems and are advancing on e-procurement mechanisms, which have likely aided efficiency improvements (OECD, 2014b; Scrollini and Durand Ochoa, 2015).

Health systems could be made more efficient by improving the quality of health institutions. In particular, a medium-term sectoral vision should be aligned with the overall government strategy. Medium-term expenditure frameworks improve the link between government expenditures and policy planning by using medium-term spending forecasts as the basis of annual spending plans. They are, thus, powerful tools that can impact efficiency through their positive effect on the supply of health-care services for a given level of expenditure.[22] In some cases, however, implementing these spending forecasts has not achieved the desired results. Adopting medium-term expenditure forecast terms is not enough; they must be carefully designed and adhered to. Successful experiences with these spending forecasts share a number of characteristics: spending priorities are easily identified from accounting frameworks; domestic resource requirements for the coming period are identified and feed into the budget preparation cycle; sector level progress is reviewed annually; and costing and resource needs for the sector are laid out realistically (Gottret and Schieber, 2006). Korea is an efficient OECD peer for higher-spending Latin American and Caribbean countries and is a good example of applying medium-term expenditure forecasts to improve fiscal responsibility, planning capacity, and spending efficiency across all areas of government (World Bank, 2013).

Yet improving the quality of governance and institutions often requires organizational reforms beyond those mentioned above to tackle inefficiencies across both government structures and processes (Savedoff and Smith,

2016). Areas of reform for Latin American and Caribbean countries include reducing fragmentation through greater coordination between different levels of the health system; supporting human resource training, distribution, and productivity; and investing in stronger information systems that support monitoring and management. Last but not least, access to detailed data is a key deficit in most health systems in the region. The fact that most countries have almost no available information on how resources are allocated to the salaries of doctors and nurses, medical equipment, medicine procurement, and other spending categories, speaks to the discretion and lack of analysis with which allocation decisions are made.

# Pharmaceutical Policies and Priority Setting

Turning to pharmaceutical policies, price regulation strategies must go beyond international reference pricing.[23] Comparative evidence from European countries suggests that reference pricing alone is not the best option to improve value for money and should be complemented with other pharmaceutical policies (Drummond et al., 2011). Latin America and the Caribbean makes scarce use of regulatory and financial incentives to favor generic substitution (and more broadly, appropriate prescription practices) whereas generic substitution is in place in most European countries (Vogler, 2012). As to incentives, Hungary provides a good example, as it financially rewards doctors or pharmacies if they prescribe or dispense the cheapest from among therapeutically equivalent medicines (Belloni, Morgan, and Paris, 2016).

Countries may also want to consider the results of regional strategies for medication purchasing and information sharing. Mercosur and Unasur in 2016 jointly negotiated with pharmaceutical companies to purchase high-cost medications for cancer. Regional information platforms such as DIME can support better allocative decisions. For example, Ecuador decided not to include insulin glargine in its public formulary, based on a DIME assessment comparing glargine insulin and human insulin (Sánchez Choez et al., 2015). Also, the Consejo de Ministros de Salud de Centroamérica (COMISCA) negotiated regionally the purchase of medicines with some DIME countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Dominican Republic). This regional policy lowered the price of selected medicines by 28 percent, saving almost US\$13 million in 2015 (COMISCA, 2015).

Finally, pharmaceutical policies must be part of a systemic approach to improve allocative efficiency through the development of prioritization systems based on Health Technology Assessments. In many OECD countries, decisions about financing health technologies (drugs, equipment, clinical processes, etc.) with public resources are made transparently, supported by a legal and institutional framework and reliable evidence (Sorenson, Drummond, and Kanavos, 2008; Giedion, Muñoz, and Ávila, 2015). The establishment of health technology assessments in Latin America and the Caribbean is growing and these investments are paying off.[24] For example, in Brazil, a 2010 health technology assessment supported the switch from highto low-cost statins (drugs used to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease) in national primary care protocols, saving an estimated \$2 billion in the public health system's budget (Teich and Araujo, 2011).

Common challenges that still need to be faced include weak institutional and regulatory frameworks, technical limitations in designing priority-setting tools and evaluating technologies, and fragmentation of actors and processes to evaluate, regulate, purchase, and prescribe technologies (Bañuelos, 2016; Cañón et al., 2016). Lessons from the priority setting experiences of three Latin American countries are highlighted in Box 8.2.

# Reconfiguring Health Service Delivery

Providing high-quality, efficient health care requires reconfiguring the delivery of health services such that primary care is moved to the forefront and integrated with other levels of the health system. The primary care approach aims to keep people well with patient-centered, first-contact, continued, comprehensive, and coordinated care (Starfield, 1994), which improves health, reduces growth in costs, and lowers inequality (Stigler et al., 2016; Kringos et al., 2013).

Prioritizing cost-effective primary care in the public health network has become a more common feature in the region that should improve health spending efficiency. Some of the more efficient health systems in the region, including Costa Rica and Uruguay, offered comprehensive primary care coverage to citizens from the onset of implementation of reform,

# BOX 8.2 KEY ELEMENTS OF PRIORITY SETTING SYSTEMS

Case studies from Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico highlight lessons for setting priorities: 1) Establish sound and technically rigorous national health technology regulatory and surveillance agencies; 2) Assure independence and technical rigor of health technology assessments (i.e., in Mexico, an interinstitutional committee evaluates the evidence developed by the technology industry and, in some cases, develops its own evaluations); 3) Build evaluation capacity and retain qualified personnel (e.g., in Colombia, health technology officials receive training and competitive salaries, in line with those of industry peers and well above the public sector range; 4) Begin with priority setting of pharmaceuticals for which there is a consensus regarding impact on spending; 5) Develop a national technology management policy to support the creation of an integrated prioritization system (simple incremental changes in single institutions can result in improvements in silos). In this case, the best example is Brazil, which paved the way for an integrated prioritization system by encouraging discussions involving all actors.

whereas less efficient ones (e.g., Argentina and Peru) started with limited coverage and gradually expanded the primary care package (Dmytraczenko and Almeida, 2015). Chile introduced reforms in 2005 (Plan AUGE) to reinforce primary care as the center of health-care networks, which covered the entire country by 2012.

Yet, investments in primary care need to move more quickly to curb wasteful spending. In 2009, in Latin America and the Caribbean an average of 9.6 million hospitalizations (19 percent of total discharges) per year could have been prevented through accessible, timely, and adequate primary care. The annual cost to the region of avoidable hospitalizations was estimated at 2.4 percent of total public health expenditure and 1.5 percent of total health expenditure overall (Guanais, Gómez-Suárez, and Pinzón, 2012.). Yet, generally, health systems in the region still rely heavily on specialist, hospital-based, and more expensive curative care rather than on preventive care (Atun et al., 2015). Considerable gaps remain in how primary care is organized, financed, and delivered. For example, surveys of primary care in six countries report numerous difficulties scheduling appointments; more than half of respondents didn't have a regular primary care provider who knows their medical history or coordinates their care, and nearly half used the emergency department for a condition treatable in a primary care setting (Guanais et al., forthcoming; Macinko et al., 2016). Some 39 percent of the Latin American and Caribbean population considered the quality of their primary care as good, compared to 69 percent in the OECD.

The core principles of primary care could be accelerated by implementing eHealth-based systems and services (D'Agostino et al., 2014). Examples of cost-reducing and efficiency-enhancing digital solutions include: telehealth and mobile health to support home management of patients; tools to enhance clinical decision-making and monitor treatment protocols; electronic medical records systems to reduce variability and improve monitoring and adherence to treatment protocols; data-analytics-based applications to help patients manage their medical conditions and improve lifestyle choices; and automation of ancillary processes such as appointments and admissions, as well as patient care, such as remote monitoring of intensive care units (Biesdorf and Niedermann, 2014). For the region to realize the full potential of efficiency gains from digital transformation, faster progress in developing national e-health policies is needed (PAHO, 2016).

Furthermore, reconfiguring service delivery can be more effective when coupled with incentives and other strategies that reduce unwarranted variations and prioritize cost-effective interventions. OECD countries use numerous efficiency enhancements inspired by reforms, among others, to provider payment mechanisms, such as pay for performance (P4P).[25] Applying well-designed case-based payment systems for providers in hospitals has helped curtail the overprovision of services and reduced expenditures compared to retrospective reimbursement schemes, generally with no negative impact on care quality (see Moreno-Serra, 2014, for a review). These experiences in setting output-based incentive and payment structures could benefit health systems in the region that still rely largely on retrospective reimbursement mechanisms like historic budgets. Chile and Uruguay, two of the most efficient health systems in Latin America and the Caribbean, have both adopted some degree of case-based financing for hospitals, alongside pay-for-performance elements for reimbursing public providers, particularly in primary care.[26] Despite the absence of hard evidence on measurable efficiency gains, these reimbursement schemes in Chile and Uruguay represent welcome—and promising—departures from historic budgets and uncapped fee-for-service arrangements frequently used to pay providers in Latin America and the Caribbean (Dmytraczenko and Almeida, 2015).

25 Pay for performance is a provider payment mechanism that establishes a direct linkage between purchasing and benefits, with payment to health-care providers driven by verified data on the delivery of defined goods and services (Soucat et al., 2017).  
26 A well-known and rigorously evaluated experience in Latin America is the Plan Sumar (see Celhay et al., forthcoming; Gertler, Giovagnoli, and Martínez, 2014).

Worldwide experience suggests P4P may play a key role in improving the efficiency of domestic health financing and delivery systems by serving as a stepping stone toward building capacity for strategic purchasing (Soucat et al., 2017). The P4P approach shifts the mentality of passive budget execution to one of active data-driven output, improving the match between resource allocation, provider activities, and the health needs of the population. P4P strengthens health systems by stimulating investments in health information systems, re-engineering public financial management systems, and encouraging reforms to increase provider managerial autonomy. Countries are moving away from implementing P4P as a "scheme" or "project," but as a step within a system-wide approach to health financing reform. In designing P4P schemes, more attention is being paid to the interactions with existing provider payment systems, the local labor market, quality and access improvement strategies, public budgeting and financial management processes, and the readiness of the general environment to influence change at the provider level (Kutzin, 2016). For example, Korea, the "efficient peer" of relatively high-spending countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, piloted a replacement of the prevailing fee-for-service arrangement for a diagnosis-related group reimbursement, and was able to assess intended and unintended system-level consequences of this scheme before its national launch (Kwon, 2003).

The Diagnosis While much more is needed to evaluate Latin American and Caribbean health systems further, this chapter provides a glimpse at inefficiency issues and their key determinants. A first contribution is the production of much needed regional efficiency health metrics. But the need is still great to improve the scope, comparability, timeliness, quality, and usefulness of health sector data in the region. This information is required to better understand allocative efficiency at the aggregate level: by function (e.g., curative vs. rehabilitative), by health-care level (primary, secondary, tertiary), and by economic classification (e.g., salaries, equipment, infrastructure). More evidence is also needed on efficiency determinants, including lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking prevalence), environment factors, as well as comparable institutional health system assessments. Using the work of the OECD on health system characteristics as an example, efforts should be made to increase the collection and availability of comparable information on health-care financing, health-care delivery, governance, and resource allocation.

The pursuit of health system efficiency is a central concern in all countries that has become more urgent due to lower economic growth and rising fiscal pressures, and longer-living populations that will push

health-care costs up. In Latin America and the Caribbean, more and better efficiency measures are essential for developing focused, effective policies. Evaluating policies aimed at efficiency improvements is also a must. Building the region's capacity to improve health outcomes in an efficient manner will help promote healthier lives for the region's current and future population without straining government budgets.

# Better Institutions: The Key to Better Public Spending

Much of this book has focused on diagnosing the inefficiencies of public spending in Latin America and the Caribbean, both at the macro level and in the myriad of sectors from education and health to infrastructure and public safety that together contribute to the well-being of the region's citizens. Individual chapters have also proposed specific policies and approaches to improve the efficiency of expenditures. This chapter looks at the final piece to this puzzle: the institutions needed to safeguard efficient public spending and execute productive, growth-oriented public policy.

From a macroeconomic point of view, Latin America and the Caribbean has historically struggled to achieve fiscal sustainability and stabilizing (i.e., countercyclical) fiscal policies. Moreover, the region has also continuously biased its spending against public investment, not only in relative terms vis-à-vis current spending, but also in per capita terms. This bias, in turn, may have hurt economic growth (especially given the region's low infrastructure levels). This is, naturally, of particular importance in a region like Latin America and the Caribbean where an important part of economic growth is driven by external factors such as commodity prices and global financial cycles. If the region aims to graduate from this dependency trap and integrate into the global economy in a more strategic manner with higher value added, better and more productive jobs, and sustained, more domestic-driven growth, the region must reverse this bias against public investment. The first part of this chapter focuses on the role that institutions, in particular fiscal institutions like fiscal rules, have had in helping Latin America and the Caribbean (as well as other regions) to cope with fiscal sustainability and stabilizing fiscal policies. The conclusion is that while fiscal rules have, indeed, helped reduce the likelihood of debt crises and procyclicality, they are not without their flaws. In fact, they have tended to exacerbate the bias against public investment. To lessen this bias, the region should turn to so-called second condition fiscal rules, which build upon aggregate fiscal rules to directly or indirectly

"protect" public investment. While de jure (or legal) second condition fiscal rules are relatively new, countries that de facto (or in practice) applied such rules grew more and reduced their economic fluctuations.

# Aggregate Fiscal Rules

In order to avoid well-known fiscal sustainability problems which, in turn, increase the chances of having to rely on procyclical policies (especially in bad times), many countries in the world have increasingly adopted different types of aggregate fiscal rules. These rules impose a long-lasting constraint on fiscal policy through numerical limits on budgetary aggregates. Their aggregate nature aims at correcting distorted incentives and containing pressures to overspend, particularly in good times, so as to ensure fiscal responsibility and debt sustainability. Reducing fiscal sustainability problems is, naturally, a necessary condition to avoid systematic fiscal adjustments in bad times (i.e., procyclicality).

Adopting aggregate fiscal rules has become a usual practice both globally and in Latin America and the Caribbean. The most common fiscal rules impose limits on debt, spending, revenue, and/or the budget balance. The latter comes in two subtypes, depending on whether the limit is imposed on the actual (typically primary) budget balance (as in most U.S. states) or on its structural or cyclically adjusted budget balance (as in European Union countries). The structural fiscal balance is typically calculated as the nominal fiscal balance adjusted by its cyclical component, and net of one-off and temporary measures. The cyclical component of the budget is subtracted from the actual budget balance. The cyclical component is calculated as the product of the output gap (the difference between actual and potential gross domestic product [GDP], as a percentage of potential GDP) and a parameter reflecting the automatic reaction of the government balance to an output gap change. In other words, this cyclically adjusted budget balance corresponds to the budget balance that would prevail if the economy were running at trend levels.

Budget balance rules were at some point the most adopted ones, but since the early 1990s debt rules have also become very popular. Fiscal rules associated with revenue limits have been the least popular and since 2012, spending rules seem to have gained consideration. Figure 9.1 shows the evolution of fiscal rules adoption since the mid-1980s. Panel A shows that the total number of fiscal rules adopted increased substantially between 1985 and 2015. Latin American and Caribbean countries began to adopt them toward the end of the 1990s. Panel B focuses on the evolution of different types of fiscal rules. Those that have gained the greatest

Note: Debt rules set an explicit limit or target for public debt as a percent of GDP. Budget balance rules (structural and nonstructural) constrain the variable that primarily influences the debt ratio and are largely under the control of policymakers. Revenue rules set ceilings or floors on revenues and are aimed at boosting revenue collection and/or preventing an excessive tax burden. Expenditure rules set limits on total, primary, or current spending. Fiscal rules, data come from the "IMF Fiscal Rules Dataset, 2016" and Schaechter et al. (2012).

traction are debt rules (which typically impose a debt-to-GDP ceiling) and structural budget rules (which limit measures of the budget balance after excluding the influence of the business cycle).

# The Truth about Aggregate Fiscal Rules

While aggregate fiscal rules are not a panacea, as they are sometimes not enforced (or sometimes they are even designed to have a certain degree

of "flexibility" which, in turn, may violate the spirit of the rule itself), they have been useful on average. Rather than dwelling on comparisons among the different types of fiscal rules (see Schaechter et al., 2012; Budina et al., 2012; and Berganza, 2012, for useful reviews), this chapter focuses on their effects on key issues tackled in Chapters 1 and 2. Figure 9.2 shows the effects of fiscal rules adoption (of any kind) on the probability of a debt crisis, fiscal procyclicality, and public spending composition.<sup>1</sup> In particular, as noted by the first and second bars, the adoption of a fiscal rule reduces the likelihood of a debt crisis as well as the degree of procyclicality. Thus far, the news could not be better on the sustainability and procyclicality fronts. Interestingly (and novel in terms of discussions about the implications of fiscal rules), yet not surprisingly, the adoption of fiscal rules increases the bias against public investment. Why? Because as discussed in Ardanaz and Izquierdo (2017) and in Chapter 1, this is the easiest spending component to adjust, especially in bad times. In other words, while aggregate fiscal rules actually work to reduce sustainability and stabilizing concerns, they do so at the expense of increasing the bias against public

investment. This collateral damage could have harmful consequences for economic growth, especially for a region like Latin America and the Caribbean, which has an important infrastructure gap.

# Second Condition (or Composition) Fiscal Rules

Second condition fiscal rules build upon aggregate fiscal rules to directly or indirectly "protect" public investment. For example, in 2018, Peru passed a law limiting not only the growth of overall public spending (which cannot grow by more than 1 percent over the economy's long-run growth rate), but also limiting the growth of current spending (which cannot grow by more than 1 percent below the economy's long-run growth rate). This rule has not only the benefit of limiting the growth of more rigid (especially downward rigid) current spending—such as wages and transfers—but by doing so it also serves as protection for public investment.

Since de jure (or legal) second condition fiscal rules are relatively new, and in order to assess their implications, the first step is to identify countries that de facto (or in practice) applied such second condition (or composition) fiscal rules and then contrast them with those that did not, in order to evaluate their relative performance in terms of average growth and output volatility. To do so, and following the Peruvian second condition fiscal rule, it is necessary to assess whether a country de facto controls the growth rate of current expenditure (thus protecting capital expenditure). This is done by checking for every country-year observation in the sample whether the growth rate of current expenditures is at least 1 percentage point below the economy's historical long-run growth rate.[2] Figure 9.3 shows average compliance with this implicit rule for both industrial and developing countries. Not surprisingly, such prevalence is larger (and statistically different) in the industrial world than in developing economies.

Moreover, countries with a higher prevalence of these second condition fiscal rules grow more, and tend (weakly) to experience less volatility than those with lesser prevalence (Figure 9.4A and B). These results are consistent with theoretical models like that of Izquierdo and Kawamura (2018), in which, in the context of either political economy frictions (policymakers who run for election and face voters with different preferences

on spending composition), or specific capture technologies (that government bureaucrats may use for current and capital spending), introducing second condition (or composition) fiscal rules indeed generates higher economic growth without significant effects on output volatility.

These results suggest that second condition fiscal rules that protect public investment may be useful in fostering growth. Thus, it could be relevant to couple aggregate fiscal rules—which are good for sustainability and have stabilizing effects—with second condition (or composition) fiscal rules that protect public investment against the natural bias against it, be it because of the negative effects of aggregate fiscal rules themselves, or the political economy effects that lack of trust in government may have on citizens' choices against long-term investments (see Chapter 10).

# Institutions for Smart Spending at the Micro Level

Public expenditure accounts for almost 38 percent of the annual wealth created in Latin America and the Caribbean. Managing from 15 to 47 percent of GDP—the range of public spending in the region—in an efficient manner leading to inclusive growth is not a task for an aimless body of public institutions. It demands purpose, planning, and prioritization of best policies, evidence-based decisions on the use of money, and a professional civil service to carry the plan out. The rest of this chapter will show that planning, prioritization, evaluation, and professionalization are common critical factors that Latin America and the Caribbean needs to improve in public spending management.

Latin America and the Caribbean suffers from two interrelated problems: public spending is inefficient and ineffective, both technically and allocatively, and it is inefficient in promoting equity. This problem is reinforced by a weak public expenditure management system—the institutions through which public resources are channeled from taxpayers to prioritized spending programs in the budget and how they are implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Poor management institutions waste resources, erode public trust, hamper growth opportunities, and limit possibilities to reduce poverty and inequality. While institutions are almost universally weak in Latin American and Caribbean countries, they vary widely across the region.

Expenditure institutions and the possibility of reform are severely limited from within and outside government, unless strategies are implemented to deal with them. To begin with, spending entities within government want to see their budget allocation increase, but finance ministries are tasked with keeping overall spending ceilings under control. These tensions increase competition and contention in the spending allocation process and demand effective coordination—one of the critical factors to achieve better results

in spending reforms. Expenditure reforms are also difficult to implement because of the many private special interests that can be affected: unions, firms, and aid beneficiaries, to name a few.

Since the late 1980s, Latin American and Caribbean countries have made great strides putting into operation important expenditure management institutions. Most reforms aimed at fiscal sustainability: quantitative fiscal rules, stabilization funds, medium-term fiscal frameworks, and restrictions to national and subnational debt (Filc and Scartascini, 2007).4 Several countries lacked budget discipline, but progress was made. The first Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) to control budget disbursements by automating and streamlining government's financial management processes was implemented after decades of missed, duplicated, and delayed payments. Centralized digital public procurement systems replaced institution-by-institution procurements, which lacked rules, mandatory competitive bidding, or lists of buyers. The civil service system was not organized, and important advances ensued. Reforms emphasized processes instead of an overall restructuring of functions. Despite the advances, however, these reforms lacked an analysis of how and how much to spend across programs and functions, and an appraisal of their effect on growth and equity.

The reforms fell short of achieving long-lasting growth and equity. They were not based on a long-term vision, and when they were, priorities were not clear or too broad. In the mid-1990s, most of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs were implemented to alleviate poverty and improve human capital; however, they lacked a clear vision of how to decrease long-term poverty and inequality. Noncontributory pensions and health care also expanded, but without a proper analysis of the effects on informality or their sustainability, particularly in the context of an aging region. Hence, despite the advances in the machinery of budget, procurement, civil service, public financial management (PFM), and even digital institutions, the efficiency, equity, and transparency of public spending continued to be weak and the link with outcomes almost nonexistent.

Some countries that implemented second generation-budgeting and PFM reforms expected to solve most inefficiencies in public spending. But first, a deep, multidisciplinary economic analysis of government spending is needed that sets priorities and a pathway for how to better achieve them. Budget formulation should be aligned and constructed from these

priorities such that PFM manages the flows of allocated spending more efficiently. But how to change the rigid budget? Anyone who has worked in budgeting knows that old claims on the budget have an advantage over new ones (Schick, 2004). This is what is called incrementalism: budgeting decisions are anchored in the past, usually varying only in small increments from one year to the next. But spending decisions can be inserted in the budget in an incremental yet smart way, making it politically viable to achieve allocative efficiency gradually.

Despite the wave of reforms, the increased spending of the 2000s in most Latin American and Caribbean countries propell an unprecedented growth in the tasks of the public sector. That is why it is most urgent to embark on a new, smart generation of reforms that improve efficiency and equity of spending by reinforcing both firstand second-generation institutions and creating new institutions when necessary. There is a small window of opportunity to enact smart spending reforms—not simple austerity measures—that take a long-term view and acknowledge that public spending is a large proportion of GDP that should be programmed with technical and above all allocative efficiency in order to ensure sustained, inclusive growth.

Smart spending requires operational efficiency, which refers to the provision of public services at a reasonable quality and cost; the relevant question is whether the country is getting the best buy for its money. Allocative efficiency on the other hand refers to the consonance of budgetary allocations with strategic priorities: are budgetary resources being allocated to programs and activities that promote the strategic priorities of the country? Put simply, is the government spending money on the "right allocations," with the highest net present value generated by a social cost-benefit analysis (CBA)? The purpose of doing a CBA is to allow competing policy priorities to be compared in a consistent way<sup>5</sup> and to help policymakers identify the best way to deliver the strategic objectives of government. CBAs should be the every day practice in appraising government spending in all countries in

the region. However difficult it might seem, the process of doing so is much more informative and can save billions of taxpayers' dollars. From CBAs and rates of return grounded in data, it is possible to understand, for example, more clearly whether and which human capital projects or physical capital projects should be favored, and in what proportions.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the challenge is to improve the technical and allocative efficiency of public spending. This chapter offers key policy recommendations based on best practices, theory, and empirical evidence provided by more developed countries, which have already implemented several of the reforms, and also from lessons learned from the experience of the IDB and other stakeholders in Latin America and the Caribbean. Most key recommendations are applicable to national, regional, and local governments.[6] Admittedly, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to better institutions to manage spending. Moreover, no single or new institution is a panacea, especially if implemented without political commitment or with minimum capacities. Most recommendations are set within a unified framework starting from planning, coordination, and coverage challenges, followed by operational and human resource considerations, and considerations related to ex-post evaluation and monitoring and control.

# Smart Shopping: Public Procurement Management

Public procurement expenditure amounts to about a third of total public spending in Latin America and the Caribbean (Chapter 3) and its management is recognized as a strategic instrument for public service delivery as well as an activity vulnerable to corruption and inefficiency at the expense of "value-for-money" considerations. In fact, estimated waste in procurement ranges from 10 to 30 percent of total spending. Achieving the best value-formoney involves three principles: economy (acquiring resources in the right quantity and quality), efficiency (minimum cost for the same service), and effectiveness (achievement of intended outcomes) (McKevitt, 2015).

Public procurement reform in the region has come a long way since the early 2000s, when it was a minor part of the second generation of public sector reforms. The region has made more progress than other developed regions, especially in advancing their e-procurement tools (Harper, Calderón Ramírez, and Munóz-Ayala, 2016). But several countries in the region, are still transitioning to procurement systems with better institutions, more agile processes, and

a heightened capacity to prevent corruption. $^{7}$  Clearly, reforms have not been enough to dismantle inefficiencies or eliminate corruption (see Chapter 3).

Implementing an effective public procurement system based on transparency, competition, and integrity, as called for by the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), is not simple. A procurement system that lacks transparency and competition is the ideal breeding ground for corrupt behavior. According to the UNODC (2013), reform initiatives need to integrate these goals. $^{8}$  A comprehensive and outcome-based procurement index is still needed. A widely used procurement indicator is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems (MAPS), which mostly measures the process against international best practice models, not procurement outputs, outcomes, or systemic performance. Still, it portrays the current state of processes in Latin America and the Caribbean: 14 governments in the region conducted a MAPS self-assessment of their procurement systems between 2008 and  $2016^{9}$  ranging from 0 to 3 with 3 meaning full achievement of the standards. For each country, MAPS presents the year implemented and the score. The results, from best to worst, were: Chile (2008, 2.7), Brazil (2011, 2.2); Ecuador (2011, 2.0); Paraguay (2013, 2.0); Peru (2016, 2.0); Colombia (2009, 1.9); Nicaragua (2010, 1.8); the Dominican Republic (2012, 1.5); Costa Rica (2015, 1.5); Honduras (2010, 1.2); El Salvador (2010, 1.2); Barbados (2008, 0.5); Belize (2010, 0.5); and Guyana (2010; 0.5). According to the results, most countries still need to improve procurement processes and evidence points to poor outcomes in several countries.

Table 9.1 provides a list of key recommendations to be adapted to each Latin American and Caribbean country. While professionalization and ex-post evaluation, monitoring, and control of the system are necessary to develop a comprehensive and effective system, there are key critical factors—planning, coverage and coordination, competition, and effective digitalization—that the region's countries need to improve to make the system more efficient and less prone to corruption.

First, the coverage of the system is far from complete. Procurement rules should apply to the whole "public" procurement system, defined widely to encompass all purchases from the entire public sector. The MAPS subindex that includes "Scope of application of the legislative and regulatory framework" (from a maximum of 3 to 0) averages 2.3 for 14 Latin American countries, implying full coverage for 5 countries, and almost full for 4 of them.

However, a complete analysis of the scope of application of the law reveals that central governments are covered by the regulations in most countries, but coverage decreases when considering public bodies (about 80 percent covered), subnational governments (SNGs) (about 50 percent fully covered), special funds, public private partnerships (PPPs), and public trusts (only from 10 percent to 40 percent). Hence, while the legal and institutional framework for procurement may conform to best practice, it does so for only a part of the public sector, allowing a portion of procurement expenditure to occur in a "liberated" zone where corruption or inefficiency can creep in. Actually, this is an inherent problem in public procurement in several areas of expenditure that starts with the coverage of public sector institutions.

Second, in public procurement, the digital revolution has been particularly productive. Over the last 10 years, the majority of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have made progress introducing information and communications technology into their procurement systems; 19 out of 22 surveyed countries have a procurement portal and all of them publicize procurement opportunities through their e-procurement systems.[11] However, by 2016, only seven countries (Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and Paraguay) had transactional portals, which allow suppliers and procuring entities to interact virtually in order to trade goods and services. Moreover, only a handful of portals incorporate public works (construction, infrastructure) in the procurement system, where the opportunities for overpricing and corruption are higher. Chile did so in 2017. On the positive side, about half of all countries regulate a modern digital procurement procedure and the rest are rapidly introducing them: 1) framework agreements: an overarching agreement for the future supply of goods and services described in broad terms to achieve cost savings by generating economies of scale and reducing the administrative burden of issuing multiple tenders; 2) e-catalogs: a digital version of a supplier's catalogs that functions as an electronic purchasing tool to help increase competition and streamline public purchasing; and 3) electronic reverse auctions, which are useful when price is the key award criterion and where there is a single buyer and many suppliers who progressively bid downward.[12]

Third, while the increased use of digital technologies and efficient tools to process procurement contracts has increased savings and reduced corruption,[13] there are still severe problems in using competitive tendering including the excessive use of exceptions and single-source procurement. The type of procurement procedure may have a direct impact on the corruption risk involved in public procurement. For this reason, open tendering is often considered the preferred method (i.e., the default procurement method) and single-source tendering—which poses perhaps the highest risk of corruption and favoritism—is typically allowed only under exceptional circumstances. In fact, only about 60 percent of 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries establish explicit competitive tendering[14] by default, but most establish a long list of exceptions to avoid competition and select direct contracting or single-source procurement.[15] Brazil, Bolivia, and Uruguay allow about 30 exceptions to competitive procurement, compared to an average of about  $10$ .[16] Digital technology alone will not solve the corruption problem in public procurement.[17] Addressing these critical issues by promoting full coverage of procurement methods, ruling out competition exceptions, and using transactional e-procurement is a major step toward greater transparency. By automating services and putting them online, the use of open data by governments

<sup>13</sup> See Pessino, Pinto, et al. (2018) on key findings on the impact of public procurement reforms on efficiency and corruption.  
Competitive bidding is used to provide the public with low-priced, high-quality contracts, to fight corruption, and to provide equal opportunities to all firms to enjoy the benefits of a contractual relationship with the government.  
Also referred to in some countries as direct contracting or direct award purchasing, purchasing from an economic operator without a requirement for an advertisement or competitive process is often permitted for low-value contracts.  
16 National legislation usually considers special regulations for strategic sectors, such as hydrocarbons (Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, and Bolivia), mining and energy (Bolivia), environment (Bolivia, Peru), telecommunications (Brazil), health services (Chile, Jamaica), pension funds (Jamaica), essential public services (Honduras), public monopolies (Honduras), or more specific cases, such as the management of the Panama Canal (Panama) (Benavides et al., 2016). These are huge sectors, and not surprisingly some of them were involved in the recent Lavajato-Odebrecht scandal.  
17 While Volosin (2012) studied the amount of exceptions that can trigger corruption in procurement in Latin American and Caribbean countries, some authors are beginning to find a causal mechanism between exceptions and corruption. For example, Auriol, Straub, and Flochel (2016) established that in Paraguay the main channel for corruption in procurement before 2007 was the systematic use of an "exceptional" purchase mechanism, which bypasses legally required minimum standards of transparency and competition and is used much more frequently than what should be expected from international best practice.

leaves corrupt officials less room to make arbitrary decisions (Moreno, 2017). By opening access to their data, governments are enabling citizens to track more closely how their taxes are spent.[18] Uruguay, for example, is close to its goal of enabling citizens to initiate 100 percent of their government transactions online. In Brazil, the Public Expenditure Observatory uses big data analytic tools to detect potential fraud in procurement. In 2015, it scrutinized more than 120,000 contracts, raising red flags in more than 7,500 cases involving \$104 million in business. One of its filters, for example, identifies when big contracts are split into smaller deals to avoid more competitive bidding processes (Moreno, 2017).

Better planning, good ex-ante and ex-post evaluation, and enhanced accountability closes most of the remaining gap in procurement systems. The need for integrity and anti-corruption measures to ensure the transparency, good management, accountability, and control of procurement systems is also highly important. Last but not least, professionalization of the procurement workforce—and personnel in all areas of public expenditure management, for that matter—is best practice; capacity is a key pillar to plan and carry out procurement processes.[19]

# Civil Service Management: The Importance of People

Reforms to government employment and compensation are important elements of public spending reforms. While firstand second-generation reforms have concentrated mostly on controlling rising employment and wages with policies such as wage and payroll freezing, massive layoffs with voluntary retirement processes, and the like, recent reforms have also emphasized the importance of specialized skills needed in the public sector and the professionalization of the civil service. The management of public sector employee compensation is important to attract qualified workers into the public sector and, hence, establish a professional civil service. It is, therefore, one of the key milestones for improving the quality of public expenditures. Several empirical studies draw a link between

18 The G20/OECD Compendium of Good Practices on the Use of Open Data for Anti-Corruption is a useful resource for countries to assess and improve their open data frameworks (OECD, 2017c). Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico have all announced that they are committing to implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard, a global open data standard for publishing public procurement information. Chile in 2018 with MIT LAB collaboration has set up one of the first Latin American platforms that integrates and visualizes public procurement data: http://datosabiertos.chilecompra.cl/.

professionalization of the civil service $^{20}$  and benefits such as economic growth, less corruption, more trust in government, improved service delivery, and efficient execution of investment. Unfortunately, according to

the IDB's Civil Service Development Index,[21] Latin American and Caribbean governments are doing a mediocre job of managing their human resources. Average scores inched up from 30 points (of a possible total of 100) in 2004 to 40 points in 2017, with the best performer achieving 67 points and the worst 12 points (Figure 9.5A). Greater civil service development may have a significant impact on the capacity of the state measured by the Government Effectiveness Index (Figure 9.5B).[22]

Most Latin American countries suffer from a combination of excessive public wages—with a public-private wage gap over 20 percent—and, in some cases, excessive employment—especially at the local level—inflating the wage bill to 30 percent of public spending, which is higher than in developed countries (Chapter 3). Latin America's labor force also lacks professionalism in tasks such as procurement, performance evaluations, and investment management. Hence, following lessons learned, some key policy recommendations based on evidence from the IDB and other theoretical and empirical literature are provided. As with most policy recommendations, there is no one-size-fits-all. The challenge is to improve workforce productivity while balancing costs and the quality of service. Moreover, labor market institutions may be an impediment to comprehensive civil service reform in the region unless they are included as an integral part of the reform. Table 9.2 presents key recommendations to reform civil service.

Whether short-run reforms should focus on wage levels and their dispersion or on employment depends on a country's starting point. Short-term wage measures provide only temporary relief, and thus, it is advisable to concomitantly adopt structural reforms to avoid the recurrence of medium-term wage pressures and avoid demoralizing employees. Short-term measures usually take the form of a temporary wage freeze, an attrition-based employment reduction, or an inflation adjustment to slowly decrease wages as a share of GDP. This process should begin with workers whose wage gap with the private sector is highest, usually less-skilled and middle-level staff who are highly politicized or union protected. While those actions might be effective in the short term, prolonged usage distorts the compensation structure if the public wage falls below the private wage. Eventually, these actions could be reversed retroactively by political forces, again putting

pressure on public spending. The potential adverse effects of this plan can be partially mitigated by targeting overcrowded areas, reengineering government by merging units/ministries, and allowing flexible reassignment of employees across sectors by removing legal barriers to mobility. As in several European countries, "social pacts"—national deals negotiated between governments, trade unions, and/or employer organizations—could be implemented. However, social dialogue to build reform consensus takes time and might be possible only if fiscal space and the menu of reforms allows.[23]

While short-run reforms are necessary for fiscal sustainability, they cannot substitute for structural civil service reforms. Planning serves to match shortand long-term civil service goals. While the region has slowly been improving its workforce planning (this subsystem of the index increased from 31 to 42 points between 2004 and 2015), performance is still weak; most countries do not have a long-term vision of human resources. Centralized personnel databases—important for short-run adjustments and long-term career follow-up—exist in very few countries. The lack of political will to fix this issue has led to huge pockets of inefficiencies.[24] Centralized human resource offices that coordinate with the Ministry of Finance and reliance on an electronic civil service payroll are necessary first steps to improve wage bill spending efficiency. Strengthening these systems is key to track all public-sector workers and control their payroll through information systems.

Another critical factor to improve civil service efficiency is to increase competition in hiring, promotion, and wage setting to establish a truly meritocratic system comparable to the private sector. However, the competitiveness of government compensation can be undermined by politicized hiring, nepotism, and powerful unions, through collective bargaining and strikes that set a wage premium over the private sector where the coverage and strength of unions is usually less.[25] Competitiveness should encourage equal pay for lowand high-skilled workers in the public sector relative to the private sector. However, unions may lead to wage compression,[26] putting senior managers in

the public sector at a disadvantage in terms of compensation when compared to their private sector peers. Even in countries without powerful unions, 17 out of 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries surveyed include minimum wage provisions in their constitutions, with a minimum wage higher than the median wage in Panama, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Jamaica, Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras (Alaimo et al., 2017). In Brazil, while the minimum wage is lower than the median, it increased 119 percent from 1996 to 2012. This increase put strain on the fiscal situation since raising the minimum wage affects not only the wage bill but pension spending as well. These provisions make civil service reforms and overall public spending reforms more difficult to achieve. Studies document how short-run adjustments in the wage bill were long-lasting when accompanied by payroll audits and structural reforms that improved fiscal consolidation and efficiency. Evidence from performance-related pay in the public sector is generally positive (Meyer-Sahling, Schuster, and Mikkelsen, 2018).

# Smart, Integrated Data Systems for Better Targeting

Integrating personal, tax, and property data pertaining to individuals and firms is a difficult task that requires a government to have enough political and legal power to be able to request and integrate data from multiple offices and levels of government that usually refuse to share data. It also requires compliance with secrecy laws protecting privacy of information and digitizing all databases using common protocols and a unique identifier. Once these hurdles are overcome, digital technologies and "big data" allow the smart automatic crosscheck of data so that government bodies (i.e., tax administration, social security administration, health ministry, etc.) can accurately identify who should pay taxes or fees and the potential beneficiaries of spending transfers. It also allows governments to uncover informality and poverty. All public institutions that feed the system with their data benefit from cross-checks in the system which in turn are set by law. Every office maintains its independence, and continues with its protocols, yet a central system automatically produces economies of scale since datasets useful for several agencies are exchanged with the central unit, which shares with third parties the information, avoiding costly individual exchanges. A system that targets subsidies and social programs based on a static snapshot will likely face serious challenges in providing support to those most in need. Best practices are observed in countries that have achieved a level of online integration between databases such that updates in one immediately result in updates to the integrated system. The foremost example is Argentina's SINTyS, but Chile's SIIS and Brazil's Cadastro

Unico are also breaking ground in this direction.[27] Internationally, Estonia and the Republic of Korea are at the forefront, using and innovating with these smart data exchange systems, or so-called e-service databases. In Estonia, all information is stored in a distributed data system and can be exchanged instantly upon request (X-Roads).[28]

Figure 9.6 shows how most of these systems are set up, which data they integrate, and what are some of the by-products. The integration of administrative public and private data could eventually encompass the employment status of individuals in the labor force and data on income and poverty, assets and properties, finances, consumption of public services, schooling, health services, and so on. Hence, the range of products and savings in government spending could be potentially multiplied. Data sharing can save in leakages (about 1.7 percent of GDP in Latin America), improve coverage of social programs and effectiveness in diminishing inequality and poverty, detect fraud in pensions and other social security payments, detect informality, improve health efficiency by providing comprehensive e-health records, and even facilitate most common services such as obtaining a driver's license or opening up a business. Argentina, a pioneer in creating this type of system in 1997,[29] struggled with the common identifier and set up an algorithm to uncover a unique identity from the civil service, electoral, tax, and health system registries. Subsequent systems with a solid national identity introduced the electronic identity.[30] On the basis of evidence from the region and international experience, Table 9.3 provides a

27 A single registry for all social protection schemes is needed to target programs and achieve efficiency (see Chapter 3). Sharing information between these programs and other databases helps in determining the well-being of individuals, in real time.  
28 Integrated individual data systems evolved from different starting points, ranging from control of leakages and coverage of transfers to detecting fraud in social security payments (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, and Chile, for example) and reducing tax evasion in Argentina, and providing online digital government services to citizens as in Estonia, or Korea.  
29 SINTyS (Sistema Nacional de Identificacion Tributaria y Social) was created in Argentina by decree in 1998. It is unique in the world for integrating data from the expenditure and the tax sides (Barca and Chirchir, 2014). The system involves more than 1,800 databases virtually and performs more than 4,500 data exchanges, 17,000 digital judicial investigations, and about 5 million individual consultations through the Web Service.  
30 In Estonia, the electronic ID is a mandatory national card with a chip that carries embedded files. Using public key encryption, it can function as definitive proof of ID in an electronic environment. Functionally, the ID card provides digital access to all of Estonia's secure e-services, releasing a person from tedious red tape and speeding up daily tasks including banking or business operations, signing documents, or obtaining a digital medical prescription (https://e-estonia.com/).

list of key recommendations to be adapted to the data exchange and information technology conditions of each Latin American country.

Political will at the highest level is of utmost importance for information systems since they involve extensive cooperation among government at different levels and offices, some of them very powerful and without clear and direct gains from sharing information. Picking winners at first, by selecting data exchange with the highest expected outcomes, can help overcome the resistance to sharing information by demonstrating the effects of doing so. To avoid breaking the needed trust that this system needs to operate, legal provisions to protect privacy and security of the data together with the most novel technology to prevent information leakages and cyberattacks are indispensable. Ex-post evaluation of products—particularly estimates of impact and outcomes (not inputs) from the working of the system—should

be constantly updated and publicized. Finally, the explosion of digital technologies and constant challenges require these systems to innovate constantly: Estonia, for example, uses blockchain to protect the integrity of data.<sup>31</sup> Hence, political support and the legal and institutional setting of the system are the pillars that allow its development while smart data mining improves targeting of transfers, increases transparency, and fights corruption. The impact of data mining on savings of money, time and paper, and on lowering corruption is enormous: for example, targeting social transfers and tariffs produced savings of at least \$100 million a year in Argentina (computed from only 30 percent of digital exchanges), for a high rate of return to a total investment of \$50 million since 1997.

# Public Financial Management: Improving Processes

Public financial management (PFM) relates to the way governments manage public resources (both revenue and expenditure). Ideally, PFM deals with both processes and results (shortmediumand long-term implications of financial flows). PFM has a broad and a limited definition.[32] This book focuses on the limited definition: the processes used to manage a treasury, automate public-sector flows of money and resources, and account for these financial movements.[33] Better processes will achieve savings, although rarely estimated.

31 Blockchain, a novel technology that enables digital information to be distributed in a secure manner, is a way to streamline the sharing of valuable information in a secure way, protect sensitive data from hackers, and give every individual more control over information.  
32 For a broad treatment, see the excellent international handbooks on PFM by Allen, Hemming, and Potter (2013) or Cangiano, Curristine, and Lazzare (2013) and the Latin American and Caribbean compendium of PFM practices by Pimenta and Pessoa (2015).  
3 The backbone of PFM as defined here is a set of "resource management" processes that ensure that after budget formulation, resources are available to those implementing budget policies, making government work. These include treasury single accounts (TSAs), which provide a centralization of financial resources and flows that were previously decentralized. To adopt the TSAs, governments need to have in place an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) that enables management, monitoring, control, reconciliation, accounting, and reporting on budget execution and accounting movements including bank account balances. It is a computerized system that tracks government expenditures and payment processing; but constitutes an organizational reform, affecting work processes and institutional arrangements. IFMISs and TSAs require integration, automation, and digitalization of government budgets and financial management. Governments commonly also have "accounting and reporting" processes in place. These allow government to keep records of financial flows, and to structure these records in ways that allow independent scrutiny. Much of this recording is still being done on a cash basis, although a growing number of countries have been moving to an accrual-based accounting system (Andrews et al., 2014; Kaufmann, Sanginés, and García Moreno, 2015).

The adoption of first-generation PFM reforms in the region took place in the 1990s as part of the overarching modernization of the state. Although good indicators of results are few, better organization of financial flows within the government and faster budget execution are noteworthy. Yet many challenges remain, including improving and updating organizational structures, legal frameworks, methods, strategies, and information systems. One key element is the absence of indicators to measure PFM efficiency (Pimenta and Pessoa, 2015). Results analysis is also missing in first-generation reforms. In fact, Andrews et al. (2014) state that whether a PFM system is good, bad, or indifferent should not rely only on whether the form of the system conforms with "good international practice," but rather on whether it delivers good results. They note that public officials who cannot rely on the PFM system to produce results must rely on other, informal and unofficial means to obtain what they want, opening the doors to inefficiency, waste, and corruption. Theses reforms focused mostly on mechanical and iterative processes from the strategic phase of budget formulation to the end of budget execution, in which governments deliver on the promises and proposals included in the budget. The reforms did not pinpoint the outcome to be delivered, the strategic vision, or the planning of end objectives, much less the outcomes of those objectives.

While PFM progress has been encouraging, it has been uneven, and expectations have not been met in a number of Latin American countries.[34] PFM cannot remedy institutional or organizational weaknesses; that is, it cannot ensure efficient allocations by political decision-makers (Welham, Krause, and Hedger, 2013). Indeed, computerization has the potential to jeopardize genuine reform in PFM. A new generation of PFM reforms must learn from the past and include these key elements: 1) focus on the functioning, not simply the processes, of the PFM system and link it with strategic priorities on expenditure allocation; 2) centralize it under the Ministry of Finance to include all public sector transactions; 3) (re)implement an IFMIS tailored to institutional capacity. More integrated systems (including TSAs, payroll, procurement, budget formulation and execution, investment, etc.) require more capacity, and so it is important to 4) maintain both the IFMIS software and the hardware to keep the system functional and secure. A key risk is that

once the procurement decision is made in favor of a vendor, the government locks itself in (unless it is willing to reinvest substantially in a different system). Hence, perform a thorough analysis including CBA to decide whether to buy an off-the-shelf or in-house custom-built system. Either way, the decision has major implications for costs and resources (Chène, 2009). This brings us to two final points: 5) keep, publish, and disseminate consolidated public accounts, including public accounting aligned with the International Public-Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS); 6) monitor internally and externally the performance and/or compliance of all PFM systems. Finally, as a practical matter, the rollout of IFMIS typically takes at least twice as long and costs twice as much as originally envisaged—even when it ends up working well. That said, effective implementation of a well-designed and appropriate IFMIS can assist the budgetary process more than any other single improvement in the technical infrastructure. Now that the experience is available to all, repetitions of the fallacy of looking for "technical" solutions to political, governance, and institutional problems should no longer be tolerated.[35]

# Institutions to Improve Allocaitive Efficiency

Allocative spending efficiency involves aligning budgetary allocations with strategic priorities. Are budgetary resources being allocated to programs and activities that promote the strategic priorities of the country? Are these priorities based on ex-ante and ex-post sound economic evidence and CBA? Is public expenditure allocated to improve long-term growth perspectives while considering equity?

Several institutions help achieve allocative efficiency. Other key elements include:

- A strategic vision based on evidence that sets out the framework and priorities to be achieved  
Results-based budgeting (RBB)  
- Integral or partial spending reviews including CBA to allocate and prioritize public spending to the objectives of growth and equity<sup>36</sup>  
Medium-term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) to gauge performance on a multiannual basis

- Evaluation and recommendations from independent institutions such as domestic fiscal and productivity councils and from international organizations (OECD, IDB, Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), the World Bank, and other local or regional banks)

# Toward More and Better Results-Based Budgeting

The budget is a tangible manifestation of national priorities: on what will the government spend? How much will go for education, health care, highways, and so on? The objective of RBB is to replace the traditional decision-making process, which is based on expenditure and inputs, with a logic oriented toward results, in terms of the effective provision of goods and services. RBB is not a stand-alone institution; it should be linked with spending reviews, the MTEF, strategic priorities, and evaluation.

Most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have or are still substituting the traditional line budget into RBB structured by programs that can involve one or more areas. According to the PRODEV index, Chile had advanced the furthest in RBB processes by 2013, followed by Mexico, Brazil, and Peru (Figure 9.7A).<sup>37</sup> The weaknesses associated with lack of allocative efficiency call for a shift from managing state services as a collection of agencies in pursuit of their own objectives toward managing as a system focused on priority outcomes. The performance budget shows what each dollar will accomplish, generally in the way of a measurable result achieved (such as a reduction in crime or improvement in nutrition).<sup>38</sup>

RBB emerged as a driver of budgetary innovation in the United States more than 60 years ago but has had an uneven sometimes disappointing international history (Schick, 2014). Why have RBB reforms been so fragile? The short answer is that RBB is hard work; one year's success doesn't assure the next year's and one year's costly investment in data collection and analysis does not obviate the need for additional investments the next year. The key question is whether RBB can become the process for allocating resources or if its principal aim should be to enrich the supply of information to budget makers. In most countries, performance reports and program evaluations were rarely used to increase or decrease spending, and almost never to eliminate

programs. $^{39}$  However, performance information can help identify measures to improve the performance of the program. The fact that few governments have a true results-driven RBB speaks to the difficulty of implementing this type of

budget. The suggestion is to have an allocative RBB with rational incrementalism, that spurs governments to channel spending increases to programs that promise the greatest returns. It should be conceived as a method for allocating incremental resources to achieve incremental changes in results. One may challenge this method claiming it exempts the "base"—the ongoing activities that account for almost all public expenditures from the RBB's purview. To construct a change oriented with marginal increments RBB, prioritized programs must be subjected to performance measurement and be expressed in causal relationships. Then, governments have the capacity to apportion costs among the results produced by spending agencies and can attribute products and outcomes. RBB would become a form of gradual implementation of a zero-base budgeting.[40] Applying RBB to the entire budget would doom the effort to failure for most countries, both because of the conflict it would cause but mostly for the informational burdens it would place on budget makers. Table 9.4 provides broad recommendations, to be adapted to each country's reality, for making an operational RBB achieve outcomes and gradually improve efficiency in public spending.

Chile and more recently Peru provide lessons learned in RBB practices for the whole region. Chile excels in the evaluations of ex-post individual programs and integrates these within the budget, complemented by incentives for management personnel (Darville et al., 2017; Guzmán, 2017; Hawkesworth, Melchor, and Robinson, 2013). The RBB model in Chile, developed gradually but systematically since 1993, uses information to improve allocative efficiency. This is an "informed budget"; it is not a hard-and-fast rule to change resource allocation, but is utilized to inform and improve the budget process. The system requires ample evaluation capacity,[41] enough resources to implement the system; and the institutional commitment of the Directorate of Budget (DIPRES). Peru has excelled in setting key priorities at a high level, developed a causal model, and integrated planning with budgeting (Box 9.1). Peru's few and more manageable priority actions to improve early childhood nutrition and skills follow the more recent evolution of RBB in advanced countries. Finland developed its most recent planning in five key

Table 9.4 Recommendations to Improve Results-Based Budgeting (RBB)  

<table><tr><td>Planning/Prioritization</td><td>Develop a strategic plan setting a long-term vision to prioritize key spending programs. Gradually introducing results-based government spending schemes is preferable to a wide reform. Spending reviews and independent evaluations of programs should provide feedback to guide decisions.</td><td>Ideally, set spending priorities whose attainment rests on sound theory and evidence. Select programs with an ex-ante higher return based on CBA to improve growth, equity, or specific objectives. The strategic plan and priorities should be aligned with the budget and the MTEF.</td></tr><tr><td>Coverage/Coordination</td><td>Have the budget cover the entire government. Start with a pilot of a few priority programs. Coordinate program objectives and measurement of performance between the Ministry of Finance and the implementing office(s).</td><td>Line ministries set performance measures in agreement with the Ministry of Finance or the ministry establishes a coordination unit of each prioritized program to enhance cross-ministry coordination. Ensure adherence to priority policy goals.</td></tr><tr><td>Operational model</td><td>Choose prioritized programs with a model explaining how development objectives, including causal relationships and underlying assumptions, are to be achieved. These programs should be articulated in the RBB, and performance indicators should be selected based on the model. Link planning and budgeting with an MTEF.</td><td>Without a sound model, it is difficult to link inputs to outputs and/or outcomes and hence devise SMAART (specific, measurable, attainable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) performance indicators. CBA analysis should be the method of choice for ex-ante evaluation.</td></tr><tr><td>Digital technology and efficient tools</td><td>Develop administrative digital data on individuals and firms (see Table 9.3) to better measure program performance and outcomes for individuals and households. Integrate RBB performance and indicators into existing IFMIS systems to better monitor indicators.</td><td>Include or improve interoperability of the IFMIS platforms with RBB indicators and compliance throughout all the line ministries, the Ministry of Finance, and other national and subnational offices.</td></tr><tr><td>Transparency/Participation</td><td>Provide taxpayers with a transparent, results-oriented budget; promote assessment of performance indicators by an independent agency (i.e., Statistical Office, Fiscal or Productivity Council).</td><td>Provide for an inclusive, participative, and realistic debate on budgetary choices (IBP, 2018; OECD, 2015). Transparency in the budget varies widely among countries and there is room for improvement (Figure 9.7B).</td></tr><tr><td>Professionalization</td><td>Increase the capacity of the Ministry of Finance, line ministries, and offices to understand, adapt, and develop causal models relating outcomes with inputs and performance indicators. Train budget analysts in program logic, costing, etc. Improve incentives for professional staff.</td><td>Gradually develop capacity to implement effective performance information systems. Complement capacity with independent studies and reviews by expert bodies including auditing offices and productivity councils. Incentives should orient personnel to results.</td></tr><tr><td>Ex-post evaluation</td><td>Evaluate ex-post the results/outcomes of specific programs, choosing every two to three years a new set of programs. Ensure greater use of the strategic spending review to reprioritize programs (OECD, 2018b).</td><td>The evaluation of the priority programs should serve to modify the budget “incrementally” if the program has the higher return among alternatives. It can also serve to decrement the budget if it has low or negative returns.</td></tr><tr><td>Monitoring and control</td><td>Develop and exercise the oversight capability of Congress and independent auditory agencies in relation to RBB. This monitoring and control should be permanent.</td><td>Performance data that are not independent should be externally validated to ensure quality. Audit high-risk programs, and consider the reliability of performance data.</td></tr></table>

strategic areas, recognizing that its past plans (with 964 strategic priorities for action) were neither strategic nor actionable. The latest OECD Performance Budgeting Survey reveals that a more selective approach to priorities

# BOX 9.1 A RESULTS-BASED BUDGET (RBB) PROGRAM FOR NUTRITION AND SKILLS FORMATION IN PERU

Since 2007, the government of Peru implemented policy measures to improve children's outcomes in nutrition, health, and skills. In 2008, the government moved to RBB as the vehicle for investing in children and followed a rigorous approach to allocating spending to achieve results in children's health and development. The implementation of priority programs through RBB in Peru is an example of good practice (Table 9.4):

- Planning: Beginning in 2006, consensus building put stunting high on the political agenda to reduce malnutrition in children under the age of 5 by 5 percentage points within five years. It was based on a sound, causal life-cycle model from in utero to five years of age that established the links between inputs (nutrition, vaccinations, etc.) and outcomes (weight, anemia, cognitive achievement, etc.). Priorities were formalized in 2011 in SINAPLAN, a bicentennial plan that set out a vision and strategic planning through 2021. The priorities were aligned to the Budget Law of 2008, creating four programs: the Articulated Nutritional Program (PAN), Neonatal Maternal Health (SMN), Learning Achievements (PELA), and Access to Identity.  
- Coordination: Primarily led by the Ministry of Finance, which brought health experts on staff and maintained close coordination with the Ministry of Health. The difficulty in coordination was overcome by bringing line ministry officials inside the Ministry of Finance.  
- Operational model: The government set clear targets in the areas with the highest rates of stunting and doubled spending. Positive outcomes were mostly linked to additional budget allocations.  
- Digital: Monitoring involves large administrative databases and the cross-checking of data that include the identity of children and their families.  
- Ex-post evaluation: Indicators were based on the causal model; the National Institute of Statistics, an independent government agency, regularly monitored output and outcome indicators.  
Professionalization: A specialized unit on RBB followed the process with highly motivated staff with expertise in areas such as capacity building for regional governments. The World Bank collaborated with the IDB on public expenditure management (including performance-based and participatory budgeting), and with a wide range of agencies, including the United Nations and the European Commission.

and performance objectives is being taken today in some countries including Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, $^{42}$  and the United Kingdom. The Netherlands is removing the use of performance information in areas where the causality between money and results is too weak (Shaw, 2016).

In Latin America and the Caribbean, Peru drew on the Chilean experience, but also incorporated evidence-based causal models, and its articulation with the RBB. At least in the nutrition programs, the RBB application in Peru provides a best practice example to the world. This experience shows that implementing even a handful of programs through RBB well is a lot of work, requires the dedication of specialized resources, but most of all, requires political commitment (the broader the consensus, the better) and solid budget institutions to build performance budget institutions on top. Between 2008 and 2014, expenditure associated with child health grew by 140 percent. The proportion of child malnutrition dropped by 50 percent. Peru reduced extreme malnutrition of children under five years (i.e., stunting rates) from the baseline of 28 percent (which was constant from 2000 to 2008 in spite of economic growth) to 14.5 percent in 2014. This occurred thanks to poverty reduction and sustained implementation of multisectoral interventions (Huicho et al., 2017).<sup>43</sup>

# Smart Spending Reviews (SSRs)

In addition to RBB, the instruments available to improve allocative efficiency of expenditures include the periodic reviews of public spending commonly carried out in OECD countries. A previous version of the reviews has been carried out by the World Bank since the 1990s (Pradhan, 1996). Their use has become increasingly popular given the need to generate public savings in the wake of the Great Recession (Robinson, 2013; Marcel, 2014) and as governments search for a "smarter" expenditure allocation across national policy priorities (Vandierendonck, 2014). SSRs can be comprehensive, including most major expenditure programs, or focused on specific programs; rather than identifying what nonpriorities and waste spending to cut, they seek to reallocate resources from nonpriority to priority activities,

mostly oriented to growth. The pace and depth of spending reviews has been increasing in advanced countries: of the 32 member countries of the OECD, only half used them in 2011 compared to 80 percent in 2018. Of those that implemented them, two-thirds reported the SSR helped them reallocate spending to match government policy priorities (OECD, 2018).

# Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks

An MTEF is a budget institution designed to strengthen the link between policy, planning, and budgeting over a multiyear horizon intended to progressively achieve: 1) fiscal discipline, 2) strategic allocation of resources (allocation efficiency), and 3) good operational management (technical efficiency) (World Bank, 2013). Consistent with the three potential outcomes, the literature distinguishes between three "types," "stages," or "levels of development" of MTEFs: 1) the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, MTFF, which typically contains a statement of the macrofiscal strategy, a debt sustainability analysis, and medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal targets and forecasts; 2) the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework, MTBF, which broadens the scope of an MTFF to allocate resources based on strategic priorities constrained with the top-down resource envelope; and 3) the Medium-Term Performance Framework (MTPF), which focuses on program objectives, (outputrather than input-based) budgeting, and performance evaluation to enhance efficiency.[44] Latin America has undergone a wave of MTEF adoptions since 2000.[45] However, from the beginning, the intent was not to reform traditional budget institutions and allocative behavior but to promote macrofiscal discipline. There was no integration between the MTEFs and the existing budget process. These reforms were introduced and understood as part of a wider PFM component and as mechanical projection exercises that did not link policies and resource allocation and did

44 Two studies using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) on a panel of developed countries found that the more demanding MTPF has positive effects on technical and allocative efficiency (measured by the cost-effectiveness of health expenditure, and health efficiency scores from a stochastic frontier model of health delivery, respectively). Even achieving fiscal balance has stronger effects in countries with more advanced MTEFs (World Bank, 2012; and Vlaicu et al., 2014).  
45 While the World Bank (2013) accounts for 11, Kaufmann, Sanginés, and García Moreno (2015) accounts for 21, and in some cases, countries report that they are in the MTBF or even in the MTPF stage. However, these assessments look at processes (and promises) rather than function, and hence by reviewing official websites, only 10 countries published MTFF documents varying from three pages of fiscal projections to lengthy reports filled with details on various fiscal risks and Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) mostly from an initial macroeconomic MTFF stage (Suescún, 2018).

not promote changes in budget behavior toward improving allocative efficiency. Yet, the conclusion is not to ignore the need for an MTEF but to resize and reformulate the approach to the possibilities and capacity of the country, including prioritization of only a handful of programs aligned with the annual RBB through well-specified causal models. In this endeavor, the much-needed capacity to adopt a successful MTEF can be enhanced with professionalization and advice from independent fiscal institutions.

# Fiscal Councils (FCs) and Productivity Commissions (PCs)

Fiscal councils are budget institutions designed to provide independent oversight of macrofiscal forecasting, policy, and performance (IMF, 2014). Its role is complementary to MTEFs and can enhance MTFFs by improving countries' understanding of their fiscal position and prospects.[46] However, the main purpose of FCs is to accompany fiscal rules and complement macroeconomic projections of the MTFF rather than evaluate efficiency in spending policy. But modern productivity commissions or councils might play an important role in enhancing capacity building to prioritize spending. Ideally, they are independent advisory or review bodies of capable researchers, some with proven public policy experience, that deal with productivity research in human and physical capital. They can be the first fiscal institutions that are directly concerned with productivity and growth. Internationally, the productivity commissions of Australia (created in 1998) and New Zealand (created in 2011), are examples of independent agencies concerned with productivity issues as well as social and environmental issues. The core function of these commissions is to conduct public inquiries at the request of the government on key policy or regulatory issues that affect their economic performance and community well-being. In addition, the commissions undertake a variety of independent research to support their annual reporting, performance monitoring, and other responsibilities. These institutions flourish more easily and effectively whenever countries develop a culture of evidence-based policy, coupled with arrangements aimed at boosting the transparency and accountability of government (Banks, 2015). These preexisting conditions are fundamental for most public spending enhancement institutions.

Context also matters: there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to pro-productivity institutions (Renda and Dougherty, 2017). The case of

the productivity commission in Chile $^{47}$  is an example. Decades of tradition in CBA and project evaluation, added to more recent ex-post evaluation of programs, culminated in 2015 with the creation of Chile's own Productivity Commission, comprised of high-level, well-trained economists who independently inquire and advise government on productivity concerns. These type of review and research commissions, quite appropriate for providing high-quality ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of alternative policies, could be important to make incremental changes in the budget.

In conclusion, it is possible to gradually adjust RBB practices to improve the allocative efficiency of public spending. The key recommendations for countries with less experience in RBB is to select a small number of medium-term priorities from strategic planning; analyze them in a causal model from where inputs, outputs, and outcomes can be identified; and then, integrate them into a narrowly defined RBB. This is not an easy task, and should be accomplished by increasing budgeting and line ministries' capacity. They can be helped in their task by advisory bodies, such as well-staffed and independent productivity commissions, and should be accompanied by periodic strategic or "smart" public spending reviews, and ex-post evaluations, including modern and ever-increasing impact evaluations of programs in the region, that can reengineer public spending gradually, but solidly. The intertemporal link should be provided by redesigned, microoriented MTEFs with priorities and performance evaluation policies.[48]

# Institutions to Improve Allocation to Age-Related Spending

Age-related spending for public pensions and health care is the largest item in some Latin American and Caribbean government budgets. While average spending is 10.8 percent of GDP, in some countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, it is 17.8 percent and 16.3 percent, respectively, which is close to 40 percent of total public consolidated spending. The situation

will not improve in the following decades; Brazil's projected spending under current parameters on health and pensions will grow to more than 50 percent of GDP and Argentina's to more than 30 percent, shrinking the fiscal space to invest in growth-producing activities even more in the coming decades (see Chapter 3). For some countries (i.e., in Central America) public spending on pensions is much lower as a percentage of GDP or total spending, but pension coverage is low and limited to the well-off. Consequently, governments are increasing noncontributory pensions everywhere in the region. These policies are not only difficult to sustain but impose a tax on formality and a subsidy to informality, thereby increasing the need for further unfunded spending since formal coverage will not increase (nor will revenues from contributions to social security) and the incidence of social policy on poverty will diminish (Alaimo, Garganta, and Pessino, 2018). The problem is how to address old-age inequities in a fiscally sustainable manner without imposing more distortions (i.e., unintended effects on informality).

Current budget-making procedures fail to resolve one of the most important tensions in budgeting: how to protect the financial security of the elderly without unduly burdening younger generations to pay for these commitments.

The OECD suggests that the rationale for governments to prepare and publish long-term fiscal projections is to raise the profile of fiscal sustainability, provide a framework to discuss the fiscal sustainability of current policies and the possible fiscal impact of reforms, and centralize responsibility for long-term policy analysis. In fact, it is critical to complement debt sustainability analysis (DSA) with long-term projections of health and pension spending, factoring in these effects on fiscal sustainability over the long term. However, in many Latin American and Caribbean countries, even current social security spending is not considered part of consolidated public spending, although the IMF GFS manual explicitly considers it as part of total spending.[49] Much less consideration is given to liabilities, even when they arise from government employees. Most countries do not have actuarial projections of pensions, health spending, and deficits (Glassman and Zoloa, 2015) and when they do, they are not disseminated. For this reason, almost no country incorporates periodic projections of actuarial deficits into fiscal accounts, MTEFs, or DSAs. Chile, Peru, and Colombia have achieved some progress in this area. However, a full analysis

of contingent and long-term liabilities from public employees and special pension regimes either in central government, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), or SNGs has yet to be done (see Box 9.2).

From a longer-term budgetary perspective, Latin America and the Caribbean needs to focus on two key areas. The first is to improve the forecasting of longer-term expenditure and revenue trends, including the fiscal impact of demographic trends. The second is to link fiscal policy to long-term sustainability considerations. Fiscal councils could take the lead in the second area. The current imbalance between taxes and spending, which has led to an unsustainable level of debt, did not occur overnight. In practice, however, the budget process is focused too much on short-term effects and not enough on longer-term impacts. It is necessary to analyze all the pension entitlements that the region's countries are implicitly or explicitly committed to pay that might or might not be in the shortor medium-term budget but are in the "real" budget that countries should consider when planning future expenditures and taxes. Moreover, it is necessary to project age-related spending on a regular basis and contemplate the effects of future higher spending on pensions, for instance, by lowering spending on other transfers and investment.

Publishing these projections regularly could help lead to a structural reform that increases incentives for formal work, reduces the budgetary cost of aging, and increases intergenerational equity. Basic parameters include the retirement age, the replacement rate, and the contribution rate. Gradually raising the retirement age in consonance with life expectancy while protecting the vulnerable is the preferred option (Bosch, Melguizo, and Pagés, 2013). For public health-care systems, evidence suggests that most countries have room to improve efficiency (see Chapter 8), which would help contain the growth of health spending while expanding coverage. When possible, structural reform should be gradually implemented to build a universal pension system paying entitlements from the same source of revenue. The aim is to provide all workers with protection against basic risks (and avoid old-age poverty), stop increasing fiscal vulnerability, and align the incentives of workers and firms to increase productivity and efficiency.[50] Consensus building, combined with the transparent release of

information on pension and health systems, might help in the difficult process of reform.

Latin American and Caribbean countries will need to make significant additional policy changes and investments to cope with rapidly aging populations. In particular, they must develop policies to help older, still-productive citizens find full-time employment or more flexible work arrangements so as to increase their labor supply, productivity, and ultimately, their well-being. Japan, Singapore, and Korea have already made major investments in automation and robotics to make up for lost productivity in their aging workforce (Scott, 2018).

# Public Investment Management

Public investment is critical to current and future growth as it expands a country's productive capacity (Chapters 3 and 5). However, it is not only how much is invested that matters but how well investments are managed, that is, how decisions are made as to where, why, and how investments are funded and delivered to attain the best possible social outcomes.[51] Public investment efficiency levels, in turn, are a function of the quality of institutions, and the relative strength of public investment management institutions. The quality of procedures varies greatly across countries and determines how well investments are planned, whether allocations are made to priority activities for economic development, and whether the implementation avoids waste and delays (Rajaram et al., 2014; Dabla-Norris et al., 2012).

In Latin America and the Caribbean, public investment is low, averaging 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, whereas Asian developing regions are investing an average of 6.3 percent of GDP. Furthermore, investment expenditures are highly volatile as they tend to decline sharply in periods of fiscal consolidation, economic downturns, or whenever public finances come under stress (Ardanaz and Izquierdo, 2017). In addition, while an important share of public investment is executed by SNGs (between 60 and 70 percent of consolidated spending in Argentina, Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico,[52] Peru, and Brazil, followed by Colombia with about 41 percent), in-depth knowledge about their management capacities is limited.

At the regional level, an analysis of public investment management efficiency revealed that the areas showing the weakest performance were

strategic alignment and project appraisal, ex-post evaluation and audit, scrutiny, and public access to information over the investment cycle. The lack of systematic ex-post appraisal and data collection on performance undermines evidence-based decision-making (Contreras et al., 2016). Investment projects that are larger than a small fixed amount should always be appraised through a CBA to ensure projects are prioritized according to the highest internal rate of return.[53,54] Additionally, digital tools are not being exploited to their fullest in the region to save time and provide more accurate, integrated, and timely information on investment procedures and outcomes.

There is an urgent need for more efficient public investment spending given the short window of opportunity that ends in 2040. International evidence and lessons learned pinpoint critical factors for the reform of public investment management systems (PIMs), presented in Table 9.5. The IDB has supported institutional reforms aimed at strengthening PIMs in several Latin American and Caribbean countries over the last 15 years, empowering national and subnational governments. A key lesson emerged—that of taking a comprehensive approach as follows.

Importantly, to avoid unrecorded expenditures in the budget or off-budget, PPP and SOE investments should be integrated into modern public investment management and general budget procedures (Box 9.2).

# Subnational Expenditure Assignment and Management

Growing decentralization of spending can support efficiency in public spending if several preconditions are met (Chapter 3), among them: 1) a fairly matching level of tax decentralization; 2) a well-defined, nonconcurrent, and transparent distribution of spending responsibilities; and 3) institutions at the local levels with enough capacity and quality to manage higher spending effectively. For horizontal equity, it is also important to improve the design of intergovernmental transfers<sup>55</sup> so that they

# BOX 9.2 FISCAL RISKS FROM PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPs), STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOEs), AND PUBLIC TRUSTS

PPPPs are long-term contracts whereby the private sector supplies infrastructure assets and services traditionally provided by the government, which funds them directly or through user fees and tolls, in this case called concessions. In recent decades, an increasing proportion of infrastructure services has been delivered through PPPs in Latin America. When compared with traditional public investment (TPI), the benefits of PPPs mainly arise through bundling, which allows the costs of building and maintaining the assets to be internalized, since the same agent undertakes them, engaging in life-cycle costing and reducing operational and maintenance costs. Hence, from an economic standpoint, PPPs should be used when they provide more value for money (VfM) than TPI, that is, when the private provider is able to deliver the infrastructure at a lower cost and with greater efficiency than the public sector. However, in many cases, investment projects undertaken through PPPs have been used not for efficiency reasons but to circumvent spending controls, delay the recording of costs or not record the investment, the guarantees provided, or the debt incurred in the budget, thereby jeopardizing fiscal transparency (Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic, 2013). PPPs allow governments to increase investment without immediately adding to government borrowing. This is tempting, particularly for cash-strapped governments trying to meet fiscal targets; while they liberate fiscal space in the short run, they lose it in the long run. This lack of a budgetary record transforms committed payments into contingent liabilities, which, despite attempts to control them by, for example, estimating risks through sophisticated techniques, are highly correlated to the economic cycle. The materialization of concealed and contingent liabilities in some European countries, such as Spain, Portugal, and Iceland,[a] during the 2008-2010 financial crisis shows that these liabilities continue to be insufficiently dealt with in the public accounts of countries. Even when private partners bear the majority of explicit risks, the government continues to be the real residual claimant of the project, guaranteeing service provision. This problem largely explains the renegotiation of contracts with high cost overruns in some Latin American and Caribbean countries. The great majority of road concessions in Chile, Colombia, and Peru before 2010 were renegotiated, leading to cost increases of between 20 and 100 percent (Bitran, Nieto-Parra, and Robledo, 2013). This situation has led to low-quality and fiscally costly investments. Governments should limit overall fiscal risks from PPPs by i) choosing the right project through CBA first, then evaluating whether to procure with a PPP or TPI, and ensuring good governance along the project cycle to avoid corruption and inefficiencies; and (ii) implementing good budget reporting and registering in the budget and on balance sheets direct liabilities as the asset is constructed. Annually, all exposure, debt, and guarantees that generate contingent liabilities and fiscal risks should be disclosed.[b] Meanwhile, as reforms are implemented, limit the use of PPPs (Honduras limits the use of PPP projects up to 5 percent of GDP, Peru 12 percent of GDP and Mexico 10 percent of revenue).

# BOX 9.2 FISCAL RISKS FROM PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPs), STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOEs), AND PUBLIC TRUSTS (continued)

State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are major but overlooked contributors to public investment in the region, accounting for a large share of total public-sector investment (Mussachio, Pineda Ayerbe, and Garcia 2015). In Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay, SOEs' account for more than 40 percent of total public-sector investment, particularly in key sectors such as electricity, water, and sanitation. SOEs face several challenges since most of them provide socially sensitive public goods and services that can undermine the soundness of their investment appraisal processes. For instance, SOEs are sometimes required to undertake very risky or suboptimal investments due to political meddling (Reyes-Tagle and Garbacik, 2016). In other cases, SOEs on their own might incur higher levels of risk as they expect central governments to bail them out in cases of crisis (Ter-Minassian, 2017). Given their public nature and the fiscal risks SOEs can entail, governments should i) require them to submit projects through a tailored procedure using CBA within the public investment-cycle; ii) strengthen control and monitoring systems of SOEs including investment decisions; iii) record their transactions in statistics and budgeting, considering them a part of the overall public sector; and iv) limit the scope for politically motivated intervention in the day-to-day operations of SOEs.

Transitory Public Firms—Trust Funds ("Fideicomisos")—are another vehicle to carefully manage investment in Latin America and the Caribbean. These extra-budgetary funds (EBFs) have been set up for a variety of reasons, including to avoid the constraints of the budget process and a detailed and transparent CBA, thereby protecting funds from political scrutiny. On the other hand, well-designed EBFs provide a mechanism for linking earmarked taxes and levies to the services delivered (e.g., social benefits and road maintenance). If left outside the budget, the funds must be subjected to a robust and transparent system of control, reporting, and external audit (IMF, 2018). Several PPPs in the region are financed through these EBFs, which allows them to remain off-budget during the entire cycle and avoid being subjected to the same provisions of the project cycle as other investments. This practice not only leads to fiscal risks but raises the probability of corruption unless well monitored or, even better, if registered in the budget.

<sup>a</sup> A recent example of the effect of a failure to record actual or contingent liabilities is the Great Recession in Portugal. Portugal's debt rose from 76 percent of GDP in 2009 to 130 percent of GDP in 2014. One half of this increase was attributable to the reclassification of entities that were off the general government accounts—primarily public enterprises, as well as several PPPs—and to interventions aimed at shoring up financial institutions (Cangiano, Curristine, and Lazare, 2013). See additional case studies for the region in Reyes Tagle (2018).  
b With regard to other contingent liabilities, the financial crisis revealed gaps in many governments' knowledge of their underlying fiscal position. To identify and mitigate all sources of fiscal risk, it is essential to improve fiscal transparency rules and practices along several dimensions, including: i) more complete coverage of public-sector institutions and transactions; ii) presentation of more comprehensive reports on public-sector assets and liabilities; and iii) presentation of more frequent and timely fiscal risks reports (Cottarelli, 2012). In Latin America and the Caribbean, there is little identification, quantification, and management of fiscal risks ranging from liabilities related to old-age expenditures, to explicit or implicit guarantees for the financial sector, to loan guarantees for enterprises, subnational governments, PPPs, and certain public trusts. Many of these liabilities are off-budget and should be quantified and recorded, particularly those that represent explicit public-sector commitments.

are equalizing,[56] that is, to allow SNGs to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services for citizens at reasonably comparable tax rates even if resources differ across areas.[57]

In Latin America and the Caribbean, these institutional and administrative constraints hinder achieving efficient, effective, and transparent spending at the subnational level. The reform of decentralized fiscal arrangements is one of the more complex areas of public finance, since it spans several policy and institution-building issues, and is strongly influenced by historical, political, social, and economic factors. Accordingly, there is no single right model; thus, advice must be tailored to each country's specific circumstances (IMF, 2009). A set of nonexhaustive recommendations to overcome the main problems SNGs face when engaging in fiscal decentralization is presented in Table 9.6. Lack of transparency and capacity at the local level are key constraints to improve spending efficiency in SNGs. Moreover, and in particular for large federations, many reforms such as increasing SNGs' tax base and improving intergovernmental transfers to make them more efficient and equalizing, require changes with a two-thirds majority in Congress, even changes in the Constitution in some cases, such as Brazil, or the approval of all provinces as in the case of Argentina. Hence, these reforms require ample consensus building and negotiations. Some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, have benefited from fiscal agreements or pacts to achieve desired outcomes. In the past, many of those agreements were highly political, without much data or evidence to make the sharing of revenues or responsibilities more efficient or equitable. Once they are based on evidence, with good analysis and diagnostics of tax bases, expenditure needs, and costs, the political consensus is expected to be enhanced. As in most spending institutions, planning and prioritization with careful diagnostics and evidence are key to improve the institution of fiscal federalism. Other institutions, such as for intergovernmental fiscal coordination can also help in the diagnostic, evidence, and consensus-building processes. Building equalization transfers may also improve the construction of a federation with common ends.

Table 9.6 Key Recommendations to Improve Fiscal Decentralization for Better Spending Efficiency  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Key recommendations</td><td>Details</td></tr><tr><td>Planning/Prioritization</td><td>Strengthen strategic planning at subnational levels and integrate with central planning. Assess human, physical, and tax capacities, how potential decentralization of taxation could be developed, how different transfers affect equity and efficiency, and how to diagnose concurrencies of spending.</td><td>Planning should be based on evidence-building knowledge and consensus for future reforms. Improve planning, management for results, and transparency. Strong planning capacity at the local level is required to reduce waste and misuse of decentralized resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Coverage/Coordination</td><td>Develop vertical intergovernmental fiscal coordination (IFC) for effective management of concurrent spending responsibilitiesa (Ter-Minassian and de Mello, 2016). Specify in high-level legislation which level of government can override decisions in concurrent responsibilities (Ter-Minassian, 2016). Develop horizontal IFC to improve cooperation with the central government on financial management in education, health, etc.</td><td>Horizontal cooperation can help minimize adverse spillovers, especially neighboring ones, and exploit potential economies of scale. Vertical cooperation can help avoid cost shifting when higher-level governments establish inappropriate standards and regulations for lower-level counterparts. For fiscal sustainability, limit current spending at the expense of capital and align fiscal rules with the federal level.</td></tr><tr><td>Own-source revenue mobilization and transfer schemes</td><td>Assign gradually sufficient tax autonomy to SNGs in line with spending responsibilities (allowing them to set rates on own taxes and impose surcharges on national taxes; IMF, 2009). Improve the design of intergovernmental transfers to increase equalization and efficiency. Special-purpose grants could be used for specific objectives.</td><td>Tax decentralization improves spending efficiency when it matches spending decentralization. Introduce equalization transfers, which can gradually accommodate further tax decentralization and smooth the transition (Fenochietto and Pessino, 2000). Capital transfers could be used to close infrastructure gaps and foster more equilibrated growth.</td></tr><tr><td>Digital technology and efficient tools</td><td>Use digital tools to i) manage a central cadaster and update market valuations; ii) integrate individual ID, tax, and social data to digital integrated systems; and iii) coordinate reform of integrated financial management information systems (IFMISs), e-procurement, and e-payroll with federal systems.</td><td>Digital tools are a core component of modern government and a strategic asset for improved service delivery. Such tools can also build administrative capacity and improve citizens&#x27; perception of public services (OECD/CAF/ECLAC, 2018).</td></tr><tr><td>Transparency/Participation</td><td>Improve the publication of timely and accurate fiscal accounts. Disclose all information, including financial interactions between levels of government, and formulas to distribute transfers to SNGs.</td><td>SNGs should disclose public accounts and fiscal risks, and consolidate all information with the central government to build better decision-making processes and trust.</td></tr><tr><td>Professionalization</td><td>Invest in local capacity building, including development of digital skills. Develop a lean professional civil service workforce to shield against political turnover and nepotism.</td><td>Human resource systems in SNGs should promote incentives, together with meritocratic competitive hiring to improve the technical capacity of civil servants. Integrate SNG civil servants in a centrally managed payroll system.</td></tr></table>

<sup>a</sup> Since 2012, Colombia has introduced the Contratos Plan in some of its departments to coordinate public investment policies, with a view to promoting more balanced regional development. The Chilean central government also uses Contratos-Region to agree on investment plans with its regions.

The evidence is scarce, but has been increasing in the past 20 years (Chapter 3; Pessino, Pinto et al., 2018).

# The Future Is Now: Social Investment Management and Policy

Achieving equity in society is usually considered an objective within each institution that deals with public expenditure, but equity cannot be achieved in fragments even though most countries approach it this way through a myriad of line ministries (social development, social security, health, education, labor, public works, and finance). Each minister is empowered to deal with specific aspects of social policy and programs. To increase equity effectively and efficiently, an integrated vision and system is needed to develop social investments. Quality human capital investments are as important as physical capital in most countries in the region to increase growth; thus, social investments to achieve growth should be treated on a par with public investment management.

The building blocks of an ideally integrated social policy should include at least the following elements.

- Planning and prioritization based on strong evidence, ex-ante CBA of all major social programs, and feedback from an ex-post evaluation of programs. Social planning and prioritization should prevent governments from manipulating spending in democratic contests for political power. Often, governments lean toward higher spending on poorly targeted transfers in the interest of

faster growth, but at the expense of long-term fiscal sustainability (sometimes labeled populism).[58]

- A long-term vision that takes an integrated approach to social investment. Latin America and the Caribbean should take a comprehensive approach and formulate policies that clearly recognize what capabilities and skills matter, how they are produced, and how to prioritize public policy for producing skills. This method avoids a fragmented and often ineffective approach to public policy that misses the importance of each element in shaping life outcomes. Current policy discussions often focus on one social problem at a time with policies designed to address that one problem, often by some remediation strategy. Examples of fragmented solutions are spending more on police agents to solve crime, building more schools, hiring better teachers, and raising test scores to promote skills. None of these policies is necessarily wrong. However, they miss opportunities for policy synergies and effective targeting. Current research on skills formation suggests a unified approach based on a strategy of human development to reduce inequality by promoting capabilities at all stages of the life cycle. Effective policies supplement the family and its resources, engaging caregivers to enrich the early life of the child and support the child in school. Policies that enhance the skills of parents to be parents are similarly effective. For example, high-quality early interventions reduce inequality by promoting schooling, reducing crime, and reducing teenage pregnancy. They promote health and healthy behaviors; they also foster workforce productivity. These interventions have high benefit-cost ratios and rates of return, passing efficiency criteria that any social program should be asked to pass. Early interventions have much higher economic returns than later remediation and prevention programs, such as public job training, convict rehabilitation programs, adult literacy programs, tuition subsidies, or expenditures on police to reduce crime (Heckman, 2016).
- An integrated vision of social investment should be reflected in an integrated social investment management strategy. A central unit should coordinate public investments (PIMs as analyzed earlier in this chapter) effectively and efficiently and one unit should be dedicated to following social investments (social investment management systems, SIMs) through the full cycle from analysis, formulation,

and implementation, to ex-post evaluation and monitoring. This process should in turn be integrated with the budget in a programmatic stance and gradually lead to results-based budgeting. Heckman, Lochner, and Pessino (1999) envisioned a system like that for Argentina, resembling a PIMS, with a broad, analytical, integrated vision with a life-cycle model of skills building from birth onward as the major building block and targeting disadvantaged families. Although schools and schooling are important, effective social policy targets and strengthens the family since inequality in families—far more than inequality in the resources applied to schools—produces inequality in schooling outcomes. It is important to examine integrated policies and break down barriers across cabinet agencies.[59]

- The social investment system should incorporate the specific characteristics, institutions, culture, and legal framework of Latin American and Caribbean countries. To improve the efficiency of fiscal policy in reducing poverty and inequality, it is necessary to follow household and public financial data and analyze how equity can be improved by different social programs and policy. Benefit incidence analysis (Chapter 4), following the modern Commitment to Equity (CEQ), allows for a transparent and independent assessment of which programs perform best to reduce poverty and inequality. Informality should also be addressed particularly in the context of escalating payroll taxation and noncontributory social programs that incentivize informality, lower productivity, hinder growth (Levy and Schady, 2013), and decrease the effectiveness of social programs on equity (Alaimo, Garganta, and Pessino, 2018). A comprehensive social investment program should gradually eliminate the tax on formality and the subsidy to informality and provide all workers with the same social insurance programs. After ensuring that CCTs reach their entire target population and operate effectively, additional efforts to help the poor need to focus on raising their productivity by helping them land a higher-productivity formal job. Tackling this challenge requires revising regulations in the region's labor markets, and the methods of financing social insurance programs. Put more bluntly, it demands tax and labor market reform. These issues, long unaddressed, are as difficult as they are urgent (Levy, 2015).

# The Challenges Ahead

This chapter offers a novel, integrated approach to expenditure policy and management from a comprehensive institutional perspective. It provides key recommendations to improve the governance of most spending institutions and national and international evidence of the impact of those policies. First, a common framework of analysis includes recommendations and evidence for those institutions most capable of improving technical efficiency: public procurement, civil service, smart integrated data, and core PFM processes. Second, a similar framework is used for institutions that foster allocative efficiency: RBB, smart spending reviews, MTEF, productivity councils, institutions to deal with aging and other fiscal risks, public investment management, decentralization institutions, and finally a new proposed institution to deal with both equity and growth— that is, one dedicated to social investment policy and management.

Although most institutions require major improvements, those dealing with allocative efficiency are less developed than those dealing with technical efficiency. This uneven development reflects two facts: 1) the emphasis of firstand second-generation reforms was to achieve fiscal sustainability either by increasing taxes or improving tax administration, and 2) the belief was that spending size and composition did not affect productivity and growth, and that inequality and poverty could be effectively and easily reduced through transfers (without affecting productivity). The assumption was that PFM reforms, including approving the budget on time, setting fiscal rules, and a mechanical MTFF would "automatically" deliver efficiency to public spending. Those beliefs are challenged in this book, which advocates rethinking and reengineering allocative spending institutions to deliver better outcomes in productivity, growth, and overall efficiency. In fact, government today is a large and sometimes selfish partner of the private sector that gives privileges to a few in contracts, hiring, etc., rather than choosing the best growth options based on CBA, growth analysis, transparency, and fair competition practices.

Considering all institutions within a unified framework, six systematic challenges for the governance of public spending hinder the achievement of the best possible outcomes:

- Challenges in strategic vision and planning. Most countries lack a strategic vision with priorities based on theory and evidence in overall public spending. There is no national planning and when there is, it is mostly a wish list, without specifying a plan based on a causal model on how to best achieve the intended outcomes.

The lack of planning and prioritization is echoed in each spending institution: procurement, civil service, public or social investment, etc. Key priorities should be kept simple and should not start covering all programs and much less the entire budget to keep them within manageable and measurable SMAART indicators.

- Coordination and coverage challenges. Overall spending lacks coordination, in part because the constellation of actors involved in public spending is large and their interests are not aligned and are difficult to reconcile. This lack of coordination permeates most individual spending institutions. Cross-sector, cross-jurisdictional, and intergovernmental coordination are necessary, but difficult in practice. Specific organizations, units, or even periodic fiscal or social pacts to coordinate overall spending and each specific institution should be created or strengthened. Coverage of overall spending in budget, procurement, and civil service systems; public investment systems; mediumand long-term frameworks; and budgeting is consistently limited and low in most countries. This insufficient coverage hinders transparency and jeopardizes most institutions, allowing many to slip through the cracks of the system and leaving many without governance. This opens up each institution to all sorts of inefficiencies, including waste and, more importantly, corruption.  
- Competition and transparency challenges. While the claim is that competition is the default in procurement, the civil service, and public investment, the exception is the rule in many countries, opening the door to direct contracts, nepotism, and again increasing waste and corruption. While digital systems help improve processes they are no guarantee that coverage and competition will be complete; this must come from enforced regulations. Open data in contracts, procurement, social transfers, and budget, while sometimes problematic with sensitive information, can help expose the loopholes if monitored adequately.  
- Performance measurement and evaluation challenges. Performance measurement indicates what a program is accomplishing and whether results are being achieved. It helps by providing information on how resources and efforts should be allocated to ensure effectiveness. It keeps programs focused on key goals. This should be coupled with evaluation and analysis to increase understanding of why results occur and what value a specific spending item adds or wastes. Finally, based on performance data and evaluations, reprioritization should gradually occur to keep spending at the most efficient levels.
- **Capacity challenges.** Where the capacity to design and implement spending strategies is weak, policies may fail to achieve their objectives. Evidence suggests that public spending management and growth outcomes are correlated with the quality of government, and this depends critically on the quality of civil service. Most spending institutions require a highly professional staff that can plan, analyze, be willing to change, and is motivated. Current civil service and other labor market institutions prevent this adequate professionalization.
- Monitoring and control challenges. Independent auditing should follow procurement, wage setting, data mining, and performance indicators.

Finally, improving spending efficiency requires hard work to build capacity within government and consensus and coordination outside. Most Latin American and Caribbean countries allowed public spending to grow faster than taxes, governance, and capacity. Cash transfers were increased without adequate targeting or without analyzing the trade-off between efficiency and growth. Inequality declined little and countries failed to achieve high rates of growth even as they risked fiscal sustainability. Nonpoor beneficiaries of transfers and subsidies do not want to lose them. Hence, expenditure reforms are more likely to be successful and long-lasting if supported by high-level political compromise coupled with extensive political consensus building and a broad communications strategy, particularly during times of political uncertainty and rising social pressure. Social dialogue and public support for reform allow policymakers to introduce more fundamental reforms; reforms with little social dialogue may well unravel after a few years. For some reforms, switching spending causes some people to lose benefits; it is best to compensate losers if they are poor (as in the case of energy subsidies transformed into social tariffs) or execute the reform gradually so that potential losers are not yet beneficiaries (as in the case of tying increases in the retirement age to life expectancy increases). As usual, most successful reforms build on better basic institutions, such as the presence of property rights, enforcement mechanisms, and basic budget institutions. And of course, no size fits all, and the challenges and recommendations must adapt to the circumstances of each country.

It is time that Latin America and the Caribbean achieves sustained growth without relying on external windfalls of any type. Technical change coming from the digital revolution is both an opportunity to use advanced digital innovations such as big and smart data and a challenge

for governments to develop the capacity to administer digitalization. For that, the region must begin to implement deep, comprehensive reforms in public spending policy and management as soon as possible. Again, paraphrasing Heckman, these reforms are not for indicating where to cut, but where to invest and how much. Reallocating public monies toward the most socially beneficial or cost-effective interventions would improve lives, equity, and overall growth.
