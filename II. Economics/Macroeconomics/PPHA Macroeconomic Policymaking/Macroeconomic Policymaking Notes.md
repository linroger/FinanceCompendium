Solow model: explaining economic growth

Production function  $\rightarrow$  Decreasing marginal returns of capital  $y = f(k)$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/e320e3ce-bce3-4ea4-b81b-eb889a99b911/e4cba85c9376c39abd0339619a3c093439480dff95df294054f09173f0e70bea.jpg)  
Steady State

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = c + s \\ s = s f (k) = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

Every year, part of the production is invested and part is consumed. Capital increases, but at the same time depreciates with time.

Capital accumulation or change in capital stock is given by:  $\Delta k = sf(k) - \delta k$

Why is this important?

Long-term growth is determined by  $\mathbf{k}^*$ , which importantly depends on  $\mathbf{s}$  and  $\delta$

Global core CPI inflation  
(percent; year over year)

Aug 27 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday pushed back against concerns that swiftly rising prices could become an enduring feature of the economy, forcing the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates and cut short the recovery.

While recent inflation readings are "a cause for concern," Powell told the Kansas City Fed's annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, responding to what he sees as likely to be a temporary trend by tightening monetary policy could be a "particularly harmful" mistake.

2021

2023

Feb 24 (Reuters) - Underlying "core" inflation climbed a faster-than-expected  $4.7\%$  from a year earlier, compared to December's upwardly revised  $4.6\%$  pace.

The report "is another indication that the impulse of inflation and price pressures is still with us," Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in New York. "It's going to take more effort on the part of the Fed to get inflation on that sustainable downward path to  $2\%$ ."

Interest rates and their upward trajectory

# CHOOSING A NOMINAL ANCHOR

A monetary policy framework provides a nominal anchor to the economy. What is a nominal anchor? Is a variable policymakers can use to tie down (control) the price level.

Examples: a currency peg (Argentina, Ecuador) or the money supply growth.

# A NEW ANCHOR: INFLATION

In 1990, New Zealand adopted a new approach. The NZCB started to target inflation more directly, based on its understanding of the links (or "Transmission Mechanism") from the central bank's policy instruments (interest rates) to inflation.

The inflation target prevails over any other policy objective, with the inflation forecast (predicted by models) serving as the intermediate guide.

# IT DESIGN

"Inflation targeting is a framework for monetary policy characterized by the public announcement of official quantitative targets (or target ranges) for the inflation rate over one or more time horizons, and by explicit acknowledgement that low, stable inflation is monetary policy's primary long-run goal."

Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin and Posen (1999)

"The Governor and the Treasurer have agreed that the appropriate target for monetary policy in Australia is to achieve an inflation rate of 2–3 per cent, on average, over time. This is a rate of inflation sufficiently low that it does not materially distort economic decisions in the community."

"The inflation target is defined as a medium-term average rather than as a rate (or band of rates) that must be held at all times. This formulation allows for the inevitable uncertainties that are involved in forecasting, and lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy."

Reserve Bank of Australia

- A major advantage of inflation targeting is that it combines elements of both 'rules' and 'discretion' in monetary policy, and is therefore often characterised as 'constrained discretion'.  
- An inflation-targeting framework combines two distinct elements: (a) a precise numerical target for inflation in the medium term and (b) a response to economic shocks in the short term.

# THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF IT REGIMES

- First, a public announcement of a target for inflation (either a point or band, symmetric on asymmetric) to be reached at a specified horizon.  
Second, an explicit (forward looking) policy decision framework to achieved the stated objective. Inflation-forecast targeting.  
- Third, a high degree of transparency and an effective communication strategy.

# THE MONETARY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM

The CB forecast the future path of inflation and compares it with the target inflation rate. The difference between the forecast and the target determines if and by how much monetary policy has to be adjusted.

That will affect long-term interest rates, then aggregate demand (and output gap) and, finally, inflation.

# Performance of Inflation Targeting Regimes

Carlos G Fernández Valdovinos

Spring 2023

- Inflation targeting has become an increasingly popular monetary policy strategy.  
- There is a large literature analyzing the effect of inflation targeting in both, advanced and emerging market economies.  
- An informative (but preliminary) step is to examine inflation outcomes, inflation targets and inflation expectations over the periods during which these regimes were in place.

In all countries there have been periods where the gap between actual inflation and the target value have been fairly small…

1 For countries following an IT policy. 2 The United States and the euro area do not officially follow an IT policy. However, the Federal Reserve states a  $2\%$  inflation target as a denominator of its monetary policy and the European Central Bank publicly aims for inflation below but close to  $2\%$ .

- While informative, the previous analysis is incomplete because they do not control for various factors that may matter.  
- Example, a reduction in the volatility of inflation expectations may reflect more stable fiscal environment.  
- What is important is to assess relative performance, and this is often done in a multi-country context where larger sizes and a control group (non IT) are available.  
- As a summary, regardless of the methodology used, most recent studies reach similar conclusions:
- The adoption of an IT regime in EM has led to lower average inflation (level and volatility) compared to a control group of non IT.  
- Adoption of IT is more effective in countries that initially lacked credibility in the management of monetary policy.

# PRE AND POST PERFORMANCE

For the same sample, convergence to low and stable inflation after adoption of IT is striking. Non IT show improvements, but as a group the display less convergence.

Over the past 15 years, there is a stronger convergence to low and stable inflation for inflation targets than non-inflation-targeters. Growth performance is also more homogeneously better for inflation targets.

# Inflation Targeting The Role of the Exchange Rate

Impossible Trinity

The impossible trinity states has lost relevance for EMs given that this countries have chosen an open capital account and relatively flexible exchange rates in the context of inflation-targeting regimes. But, is the exchange rate (or its volatility) irrelevant now…or not?

Better integration of EMs into the global goods and financial systems has it benefits, but brought also new challenges: large swings in capital flows (reflecting risk-on and risk-off changes in global market sentiments) and large swings in global commodity prices.

EMs monetary policy framework have increasingly focused on maintain domestic price stability. An increasing number operates an explicit inflation targeting regime, while the number using an explicit exchange rate target anchor has declined. Still, EMs inflation targets put significant weight on exchange rate considerations.

# IT AND FX RATE SWINGS

The evolution of capital flows have gone hand in hand with major swings in EMs exchange rates: inflows (outflows) coincided with persistent appreciations (depreciations) relative to trend. Another source of exchange rate volatility have been the dynamic of commodity prices.

There are at least two channels by which exchange rate fluctuations affect macroeconomic stability in EMs: (i) exchange rate pass-through to inflation, (ii) domestic financial conditions.

Emerging Markets Currencies and Commodity Prices

Impact on the CPI: (i) directly through their effect on import prices. This effect is generally larger in EMs than in advance economics due to the larger share of tradable goods, in particular food, in the consumption baskets; (ii) second-round effects, which depends on the characteristics of the domestic inflation process.

Impact on domestic financial conditions: (i) an appreciation of the domestic currency would reduce debt servicing cost and debt burden, lowering EMs borrowers credit risk, attracting even more capital and loosening financial conditions, (ii) an appreciation of the domestic currency would increase the value of local currency assets in foreign investor's home currency terms. This fact relax (risk) constraints, encouraging further investments and pushing down bond yields by compressing the credit risk premium.

# A NEW DILEMMA

Consider the following scenario of a sudden fall in commodity prices (alternatively, an increase in world interest rates) leading to:

A slowdown/ recession in economic activity

A fall in net capital inflows

A depreciation of the domestic currency

An increase in inflation.

What should the CB do?

This new dilemma have implication for the cyclicality of monetary policy. Choosing to defend the currency/ fight inflation in recessionary times implies pursuing a procyclical monetary policy (i.e. monetary policy aggravates underlying inflation).

Reason: in EMs, output and inflation are generally negatively correlated. As a result, unlike advanced economies, EMs have traditionally pursued procyclical monetary policy.

TINBERGEN RULE: states that there should be at least the same number of instruments as there are targets. Otherwise, some of the targets may not be achieved. In this context, the monetary authority can be viewed as having two targets (output and depreciation/inflation) and a single instrument.

Still, many countries (as happened in fiscal policy) have become countercyclical in recent years. Key: a greater credibility of the monetary policy framework, resulting from the implementation of inflation targeting schemes with ambitious inflation targets, have succeeded.

# Best friend or worse enemy?

During the 80's the debate was centered on the inflationary effects of central bank financing of fiscal deficits

Coordination of macroeconomic policies helped Latin America to tame the negative effects of the last global financial crisis (Valdivia y Pérez 2013).

Coordination between monetary and fiscal policy is an ongoing topic on debates

High debt levels could affect risk perceptions generating unwanted effects following a change in the monetary policy rate (Blanchard 2004).

Combination of fiscal rules and inflation targeting regime improve fiscal performance and achieve lower inflation rates on average (Combes et. al 2014).

# Lessons from Brazil (Blanchard 2004)

Under normal circumstances, an increase in domestic real interest rates should lead to an increasing "appetite" for domestic debt and to a currency appreciation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/e320e3ce-bce3-4ea4-b81b-eb889a99b911/8d99b2f68bbc68545d0f8fc711c5702c4f9d5c2c5ea0ee4a00f9f9b9605494c9.jpg)

However, if the interest rate increase also rise the probability of sovereign debt default, we could end-up with an opposite result.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/e320e3ce-bce3-4ea4-b81b-eb889a99b911/3943c8d5a8b80ff104b089e9e05da64f41954c4dfa2558c827ee76194a5c8a88.jpg)

The probability of having this unexpected result increases with higher debt levels, greater proportion of debt in foreign currency and elevated risk premiums.

According to Blanchard (2004), this was the Brazilian case during 2002. A similar discussion was observed at end-2015.

In these cases, fiscal policy, not monetary policy, is the most efficient tool to reduce inflation rates.

# FINAL REMARKS

In Paraguay, the history of nominal stability is the result of a prudent monetary policy AND a sound fiscal policy.

Implementation of an IT regime was an important step to consolidated our nominal stability record.

An unsustainable fiscal policy could destroy central bank independence, despite the institution having legal independence…."it takes two to tango"

Fiscal rules can contribute to the overall credibility of macroeconomic policies. We should not forget coordination with financial policies.

Not always all pre-conditions to adopt an IT regime will be "totally" met so……

# Inflation and Central Bank Independence

Carlos G Fernández Valdovinos

Spring 2023

Central banks around the globe are accomplished institutions.

While most CB conquered price stability (some earlier than others), its institutional strengths and associated credibility is frequently tested (i.e. global financial markets, pandemic).

Inflation targeting has become an increasingly popular monetary policy strategy.

Recent months have been challenging for CBs: rising inflation combined with weakened economic activity.

There is a risk of government trying to influence the dynamics of monetary policy. Example, putting more weight on GDP growth or through fiscal dominance.

All this could erode CB independence in many countries and damage monetary policy credibility for years to come.

Achieving CB independence and conquering price stability in Latin America was a rocky journey.

The index of central bank independence (CBI) is built on the spirit of the Cukierman and others (1992) index.

It considers four key elements, which lay the foundations for monetary policy formulation and implementation:

NaN. the legal mandate (policy objective)  
NaN. its governing structure (central bank governance)  
NaN. the powers to control monetary policy vis-à-vis the government (policy formulation)  
NaN. the conditions for financing government expenditure (central bank lending).

# Notice that:

Since the index uses information from CB's legislation, it is an index of legal central bank independence.  
The CBI index varies in a continuous scale from 0 to 1, such that the closer to 1 the higher is the independence of the CB.

The index evolution shows that independence fell shortly after CB were created and declined even more when government took control of CBs.

The trend was reversed in the 1990s with the approval of the new legislation that conferred independence to CBs.

\pi_ {i, t} = \alpha_ {c} + \beta C B I _ {i, t} + \delta X _ {i, t - 1} + \varepsilon_ {f, i, t}
$$

The panel approach is aimed at estimating the "average" response of inflation to difference in CB independence.

Fact 1: coincidental with periods of poor economic performance countries in Latin America experienced several economic crisis.  
Fact 2: specific symptoms varied: high inflation rates, balance of payment crisis and large devaluations, banking crisis, defaults on debt, etc.  

- Hypothesis: all economic crisis in Latin America have been the result of poorly designed or poorly implemented macro-fiscal policies.

# Conceptual framework

The framework, developed by Sargent (1986), consist of two main ideas (blocks):

A budget identity for the consolidate government  
A demand for real money.

The first block is the government budget identity. Government is constraint on its decisions, can choose only three of the following four policies:

Total Expenses  
Total Revenues  
Increases in Debt  
Increases Money supply

# Main idea

Government has two ways of financing its (exogenous) deficit:

Issuing debt  

- Printing money

- The second block is a demand for real money balances. The demand for real money equation establishes a relationship between the general price level, short-term interest rate, total real income and some measure of money.

# Demand for real money balances equation:

$$
\frac {M _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \gamma - \delta \left(\frac {P _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t}}\right)
$$

where  $M_{t}$  is the outstanding stock of money,  $P_{t}$  is the price level, and  $\gamma > \delta$ . Solving for the difference equation above, we get*:

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \left(\frac {\delta}{\gamma}\right) ^ {j} M _ {t + j}
$$

# Main result

Sustained increases in money growth generate sustained increases in prices.

# CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

- $\xi_{t} = \left(\frac{E_{t}P^{*}}{P_{t}}\right)\longrightarrow$  real exchange rate

# CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

We can write the budget constraint as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (\theta_ {t} ^ {N} - \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {N}) + (\theta_ {t} ^ {r} - \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {r}) + (\xi_ {t} \theta_ {t} ^ {*} - \xi_ {t} \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {*}) + (m _ {t} - m _ {t - 1}) + m _ {t - 1} \left(1 - \frac {1}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}}\right) \\ = \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {N} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}} - 1\right) + \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {r} \left(\frac {r _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t}} - 1\right) + \xi_ {t} \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {*} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1} ^ {*}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t} ^ {*}} - 1\right) + d _ {t} + \tau_ {t} \\ \end{array}
$$

- LHS: the first three terms represent increases in debt-to-output ratios in the three different types of debt: nominal, indexed, and foreign currency.  
- LHS: the fourth term represents increases in high-powered money (as percentage of GDP) and the last one measures seigniorage.  
- RHS: the first three terms represent the service costs on each of the three debt types (discounted by GDP growth).  
- RHS: the final two terms represent the fiscal deficit, including the extraordinary transfers  $T_{t}$ , as a fraction of output.
- Result: sustained fiscal deficits do not necessarily imply that inflation needs to increase as there is the possibility of issuing bonds.  
- Still, the government may eventually face constraints in its ability to borrow.  
- As a first approximation, the limit should be related to the ability of the government to generate future surpluses:

$$
\theta_ {t} ^ {N} + \theta_ {t} ^ {r} + \xi_ {t} \theta_ {t} ^ {*} \leq \Theta
$$

where,  $\Theta$  is an exogenously specified number.

Debt financing does not eliminate the interdependence between fiscal and monetary policy, it only postpone the debate. Once the debt is high enough, two possible outcomes:

- Fiscal dominance = when fiscal authority wins and the central bank monetizes deficits (e.g. LAC).  
- Monetary dominance = when monetary authority wins and the fiscal authority generates surpluses (e.g. US in the 90s).

Fiscal budget constraint when the debt limit is binding and the financing needs are still positive:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (m _ {t} - m _ {t - 1}) + m _ {t - 1} \left(1 - \frac {1}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}}\right) \\ = \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {N} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}} - 1\right) + \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {r} \left(\frac {r _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t}} - 1\right) + \xi_ {t} \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {*} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1} ^ {*}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t} ^ {*}} - 1\right) + d _ {t} + \tau_ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

Inflation is unavoidable!

Annual Inflation In percentage

- With minor modification, it is possible to accommodate balance of payments crises when countries chose to fix devaluation rates. Krugman (1979)  
Assuming PPP holds:

$$
P _ {t} = E _ {t} P _ {t} ^ {*}
$$

- Then, given foreign inflation and a fixed exchange rate, the government pins down domestic inflation rate.  
- Under this conditions, the real money demand equation determines the path for the money supply (impossible Trinity).

$$
\frac {M _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \gamma - \delta \left(\frac {P _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t}}\right)
$$

- Fiscal budget constraint for a country which has reached its debt limit and has a fixed exchange rate regime.

$$
\begin{array}{l} (m _ {t} - m _ {t - 1}) + m _ {t - 1} \left(1 - \frac {1}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}}\right) \\ = \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {N} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}} - 1\right) + \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {r} \left(\frac {r _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t}} - 1\right) + \xi_ {t} \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {*} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1} ^ {*}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t} ^ {*}} - 1\right) + d _ {t} + \tau_ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

- Step 1: despite the fiscal deficit, the exchange rate regime contain domestic inflation at the cost of a systemic decline in the stock of reserves.  
- Step 2: a balance-of-payments crisis unfolds after a sequence of positive deficits that are "financed" with those reserves.
- Under a speculative attack the central bank would not have enough reserves to support the exchange-rate regime  $\rightarrow$  devaluation ensues, which, through the PPP constraint, pushes domestic prices upward.  
- Thus, exchange rates regimes may delay the inflationary consequences of chronic deficits. This delay is paid for by the reduction in the stock of foreign reserves held at the central bank.

- Several symptoms: several balance of payment crises, three periods of hyperinflation, two defaults on government debt, three banking crises.  
- A number of monetary reforms: 13 (thirteen) zeros removed from currency!  
- But only one root: inability to tame fiscal deficits.  
Four sub-periods:

1960-1977: economy closed to capital movements, high growth.  
1977-1990: first liberalization of financial markets and increase in foreign debt, default, money printing, hyperinflation.  
1991-2001: currency board, second liberalization of financial markets and successful debt renegotiation, low inflation, high growth.  
2002-2017: end of currency board, default, country excluded from international financial markets, efforts to renegotiate debt, moderate growth, high inflation but moderate relative to the past.

- Off-the-book expenditures (transfers): 2002 banking crisis resolution.  
1960-1975: sizeable primary deficits, small interest payments given low debt levels, monetary financing, high inflation rates, negative transfers.  
1976-1990: high primary deficits, bigger interest payments, large increases in government debt, seigniorage and inflation substantially higher.  
1991-2001: radical change in behavior, negligible seigniorage due to currency board, positive transfers given bond issuance to pay pension holders.  
- 2002-2017: resurgence in seigniorage, primary deficit negative (but that changed in final years), large transfers due to off-budget expenses after the 2002 banking crisis.

- Brazil's economic history between 1960 and 2016 is a history of economic stabilization plans.  
- The first one (PAEG or Government Economic Action Plan) in 1964 looked to stabilized inflation of around 100 percent per year.  
- The last one (Real) in 1994 looked to stabilized inflation of around 90 percent per MONTH.  
- Three sub-periods:

1960-1980: fast economic growth, high inflation and moderate deficits.  
1981-1994: slow growth with hyperinflation, high deficits severe balance of payment crisis.  
1995-2016: moderate growth with low inflation and low deficits.

- The high-inflation period (1960-1994) was characterized by a combination of fiscal deficits, passive monetary policy, and constraints on debt financing.  
- The transition to the low-inflation period (1995-2016) was characterized by improvements in all of these features.  
- Two singular characteristics: (i) a long period of very high inflation, over 100 percent (1980-1994); (ii) modest levels of deficits for very high underlying inflation rates.  
- Two features of the economy: (ii) a poor institutional framework in which other public entities besides the monetary authority had indirect control over money issuance; (ii) a high degree of indexation in the economy to past inflation with a passive monetary policy.  
- Together, these features created the time inflation inertia and gave many the illusion that rising prices could be cured without major improvements in the fiscal stance.

1960-1964: markets for government debt securities were underdeveloped, thus there were restrictions on domestic and external debt financing. Primary deficits had to be financed with seigniorage revenues.  
1964-1972: after the PAEG stabilization plan, deficits were reduced and the government were able to issue domestic debt securities.  
1973-1980: rising debt financing in external markets and seigniorage revenues, associated with higher interest payments and rising transfers (SOEs investments).  

- 1981-1994: debt crisis, so seigniorage revenues finance the payments of (principal and interest) the external debt as well as the primary deficits.  
1995-2002: improvements in fiscal deficits lower seigniorage.  
2003-2011: replacement of external debt by domestic debt.  
2012-2016: deterioration in fiscal balance financed by domestic debt.

# PARAGUAY: A TYPICAL BOP CRISIS

- Best macroeconomic performance in the region.  
- Nevertheless, still one of the poorest countries in LAC.  
- Paraguay has narrowed income gap, but efforts were not sufficient.  
- Low levels of income per capita, low-quality infrastructure and education.  
- Macroeconomic stability is necessary but not sufficient.

In the period of analysis, we can observe:

- Political will to keep inflation low.  
- Some hicups in the process.  
- Three monetary regimes:
- Between 1960 and 1980, there was a fixed exchange rate regime.  
- Between 1981 and 1990, the central bank financed government deficits.  
- After 1992, an independent central bank conducted monetary policy to keep inflation low.

*Log (base 2) of real GDP per capita and 2 percent growth trend.

Assuming PPP holds:

$$
P _ {t} = E _ {t} P _ {t} ^ {*}
$$

- Then, given foreign inflation and a fixed exchange rate, the government pins down domestic inflation rate. Under this conditions, the real money demand equation determines the path for the money supply.  
In a country with debt constraints and fixed exchange rate regime.

$$
\begin{array}{l} (m _ {t} - m _ {t - 1}) + m _ {t - 1} \left(1 - \frac {1}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}}\right) \\ = \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {N} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t}} - 1\right) + \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {r} \left(\frac {r _ {t - 1}}{g _ {t}} - 1\right) + \xi_ {t} \theta_ {t - 1} ^ {*} \left(\frac {R _ {t - 1} ^ {*}}{g _ {t} \pi_ {t} ^ {*}} - 1\right) + d _ {t} + \tau_ {t}, \\ \end{array}
$$

- It is not possible to print money. Given a value for the primary deficit and the interest payments, the only way to satisfy the budget identity its through adjustments in transfers,  $\tau_{t}$ .  
- This terms reflects adjustments on Central Banks' reserves.

Sources: Central Bank of Paraguay, Ministry of Finance, and Secretariat for Planning. Notes: Values expressed as percentage of GDP. Seigniorage is computed as  $m_{t-1} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\pi_t g_t} \right)$ , where  $m_{t-1}$  corresponds to the real monetary-base-to-GDP ratio in  $t-1$ ,  $\pi_t$  is the gross inflation rate, and  $g_t$  is the gross real growth rate of GDP. The deficit comprises the nonfinancial public-sector deficit excluding external debt interest payments.

# Appendix

# Demand for real money balances equation solution (step-by-step)

We start with:

$$
\frac {M _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \gamma - \delta \left(\frac {P _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t}}\right)
$$

Solving for  $P_{t}$  returns:

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} (M _ {t} + \delta P _ {t + 1})
$$

Replacing  $P_{t + 1}$  we get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \bigg (M _ {t} + \delta \left(\frac {1}{\gamma} (M _ {t + 1} + \delta P _ {t + 2})\right) \bigg) \\ P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \left(M _ {t} + \frac {\delta}{\gamma} M _ {t + 1} + \frac {\delta^ {2}}{\gamma} P _ {t + 2}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Replacing  $P_{t + 2}$  we get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \bigg (M _ {t} + \frac {\delta}{\gamma} M _ {t + 1} + \frac {\delta^ {2}}{\gamma} \bigg (\frac {1}{\gamma} (M _ {t + 2} + \delta P _ {t + 3}) \bigg) \bigg) \\ P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \left(M _ {t} + \frac {\delta}{\gamma} M _ {t + 1} + \frac {\delta^ {2}}{\gamma^ {2}} M _ {t + 2} + \frac {\delta^ {3}}{\gamma^ {2}} P _ {t + 3}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

If we continue replacing  $P_{t + 3}, P_{t + 4}, P_{t + 5}, \ldots$ :

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \bigg (M _ {t} + \frac {\delta}{\gamma} M _ {t + 1} + \frac {\delta^ {2}}{\gamma^ {2}} M _ {t + 2} + \frac {\delta^ {3}}{\gamma^ {3}} M _ {t + 3} + \frac {\delta^ {4}}{\gamma^ {4}} M _ {t + 4} + \frac {\delta^ {5}}{\gamma^ {5}} M _ {t + 5} + \dots \bigg)
$$

Which is exactly what our solution states:

$$
P _ {t} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} \left(\frac {\delta}{\gamma}\right) ^ {j} M _ {t + j}
$$

- Equation to estimate the average impulse response of output to fiscal consolidation using panel data analysis:

$$
g _ {i t} = \alpha + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {2} \beta_ {j} g _ {i, t - j} + \sum_ {s = 0} ^ {2} \beta_ {s} A B F C _ {i, t - s} + \mu_ {i} + \lambda_ {t} + v _ {i t},
$$

The equation has the growth rate of real GDP  $(\mathrm{g})$  as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables are the current and lagged values of the fiscal consolidation measures, where ABFC is the estimated size of the action-based fiscal consolidation measures as a percent of GDP.

# FISCAL ADJUSTMENT: REDUCING OUTPUT LOSSES

# Impact of fiscal consolidation on GDP and Unemployment

Fiscal consolidation is normally contractionary. A fiscal consolidation equal to 1 percent of GDP typically reduces real GDP by about 0.5 percent and raises the unemployment rate by about 0.3 percentage point.

# FISCAL ADJUSTMENT: REDUCING OUTPUT LOSSES

# Response of monetary conditions to fiscal consolidation

Interest rate cuts and a decline in the value of the domestic currency usually play a key supportive role during episodes of fiscal consolidation.

# Response of GDP components to fiscal consolidation

Net exports typically expand in response to fiscal consolidation, providing a key cushion for GDP. In contrast, domestic demand contracts. The boom in net exports reflects both an increase in exports in response to the real exchange rate depreciation and a decline in imports reflecting the fall in income.

# Impact of fiscal consolidation and monetary conditions Impact of a  $1\%$  GDP Fiscal Consolidation

Why are spending-based consolidations less contractionary? Partly because they benefit from monetary stimulus, whereas tax-based adjustments feature monetary tightening.

# Impact of fiscal consolidation on output, by level of risks Impact of a  $1\%$  GDP Fiscal Consolidation

Fiscal consolidation preceded by high perceived sovereign risk is less contractionary than when preceded by low perceived default risk. But even for the group with high perceived risk, fiscal retrenchment rarely triggers faster growth. Exceptions include Denmark (1983) and Ireland (1987)—two cases of fiscal consolidation studied by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990)—which were expansionary.

Note: Debt rules set an explicit limit or target for public debt as a percent of GDP. Budget balance rules (structural and nonstructural) constrain the variable that primarily influences the debt ratio and are largely under the control of policymakers. Revenue rules set ceilings or floors on revenues and are aimed at boosting revenue collection and/or preventing an excessive tax burden. Expenditure rules set limits on total, primary, or current spending. Fiscal rules, data come from the "IMF Fiscal Rules Dataset, 2016" and Schaechter et al. (2012).

"Impose limits (ceiling) on the headline fiscal balance (deficit), sometimes with the exclusion of some expenditures or revenue items"

- Positive: simple and they are good for debt sustainability goals.  
- Negative: can lead to procyclical policy and bias against investment.

Notes: Data for 2019 are preliminary. The OECD average in 2019 is calculated by applying the unweighted average percentage change for 2019 in the 35 countries providing data for that year to the overall average tax to GDP ratio in 2018.  
The 2016 OECD average tax-to-GDP ratio includes the one-off revenues from stability contributions in Iceland. Without these revenues included, the OECD average tax-to-GDP ratio in 2016 would have been  $33.5\%$ .

# DERIVATION OF CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED FISCAL BALANCE

Cyclically Adjusted Balance (CAB) = Cyclically adjusted revenue  $(\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{CA}})$  - Cyclically adjusted expenditure  $(G^{\mathrm{CA}})$

$$
T ^ {C A} = T \left(\frac {Y ^ {P}}{Y}\right) ^ {\varepsilon_ {T, Y}}
$$

T: Actual Revenue

Y: Output

$Y^{P}$ : Potential Output

$\varepsilon_{T,Y}$ : Revenue elasticity

$$
G ^ {C A} = G \left(\frac {Y ^ {P}}{Y}\right) ^ {\varepsilon_ {G, Y}}
$$

G: Actual Expenditure

Y: Output

$Y^{P}$ : Potential Output

$\varepsilon_{G,Y}$ : Expenditure elasticity

If elasticity is positive: revenue is procyclical

If elasticity is negative: expenditure is countercyclical

- Elasticity measures how much revenues or expenditures increase (\%) when output increases in  $1\%$  
- It is necessary to have a good approximation of potential output, otherwise there can be several errors.

# DERIVATION OF CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED FISCAL BALANCE

# CALCULATING ELASTICITY

There are several econometric/statistic methods to calculate elasticity. However, the following values are commonly used in economic literature:

- Revenue Elasticity = 1 (or greater)  
- This means that a  $1\%$  output increase implies a  $1\%$  (or greater) increase in revenues (procyclical)  
- Why?: proportional taxes (VAT), social transfers, progressive taxes.
- Expenditure Elasticity = 0 or less
- Most of expenditures don't depend on output (for example: public sector wages)  
- Unemployment insurance is a countercyclical component.

# DERIVATION OF CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED FISCAL BALANCE

# INTERPRETATION

Boom:

$$
Y > Y ^ {P} \rightarrow T ^ {C A}, G \leq G ^ {C A} \Rightarrow
$$

The cyclically adjusted balance is less than the general balance (countercyclical)

Recession:

$$
Y <   Y ^ {P} \rightarrow T ^ {C A}, G \geq G ^ {C A} \Rightarrow
$$

The cyclically adjusted balance is greater than the general balance (countercyclical)

# Chile's Formula to Calculate Structural Fiscal Balance.

The structural balance indicator can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} B E _ {t} = B e _ {t} - T N M I N _ {t} + \left\lfloor T N M I N _ {t} \left(\frac {Y _ {t} ^ {*}}{Y e _ {t}}\right) ^ {\gamma} \right\rfloor - T M I N _ {t} + T M I N E _ {t} - I C C _ {t} \\ + I C C E _ {t} - I C M _ {t} + I C M E _ {t} \\ \end{array}
$$

where:

$BE_{t}$  = structural balance in period t

$B e_{t}$  = effective balance (accrued) in period t

TNMIN  $t =$  net non-mining tax revenue and social security in-payments in period t

TNMIN\*t = structural net non-mining tax revenue and social security in-payments in period t

$TMIN_{t}$  = income from taxation of private mining companies in period t

$TMINE_{t} =$  structural income from taxation of private mining companies in period t

$Y e_{t}$  = effective GDP in period t  
$Y^{*}_{t}$  = trend GDP in period t  
$ICC_{t}$  = effective transfers from CODELCO on account of copper sales in period t  
$ICE_{t}$  = structural transfers from CODELCO on account of copper sales in period t  
$ICM_{t}$  = effective transfers from CODELCO on account of molybdenum sales in period t  
$ICME_{t}$  = structural transfers from CODELCO on account of molybdenum sales in period t  
$\varepsilon$ $=$  GDP elasticity of tax revenue

"Set limits on total, primary or current spending, and the limits apply to nominal or real expenditure"

- Positive: easy to understand, monitor and enforce.  
- Negative: when set as percentage of GDP, they are procyclical.

Note: National rules include those covering the general government (GG) and central government (CG).

# The expenditure benchmark

This benchmark is a rule which contains the net growth rate of government spending at or below a country's medium-term potential economic growth rate, depending on the country's position in relation to its medium-term budgetary objectives (MTOs).

Under the expenditure benchmark, spending increases which go beyond a country's medium-term potential economic growth rate must be matched by additional discretionary revenue measures.

The expenditure benchmark complements the medium-term budgetary objectives (MTO) by putting growth in net expenditure on a sustainable path and therefore helping to move towards or maintain the MTO itself.

The expenditure benchmark was introduced as part of the 2011 reforms (the so-called "six pack").

EU expenditure benchmark targets an aggregate of expenditure which excludes the following items: interest spending, expenditure on EU programs fully matched by EU funds revenue and cyclical elements of unemployment benefit expenditure. In addition, investment spending is averaged over a four-year period to smooth the impact of any large investment projects.

Fiscal Rules Adoption and the Probability of Debt Crisis, Fiscal Procyclicality, and Public Spending Composition

Source: Authors' elaboration based on Izquierdo, Puig, et al. (2018b).

Note: a) Data for probability of debt crisis come from Reinhart and Rogoff (2011); b) Fiscal rules data come from the "IMF Fiscal Rules Dataset, 2016" and Schaechter et al. (2012); c) Cyclicality is measured by the correlation coefficient between the cyclical component of GDP and cyclical component of total expenditure (both in terms of their trend), calculated with a rolling window of 10 years (WEO-IMF) and d) Bias composition is measured through the ratio between capital spending and primary current spending (WEO-IMF).

Bars represent the associated coefficient between each dependent variable and the fact of having a fiscal rule. All regressions are estimated using panel data with fixed effects and control for heteroscedasticity. Number of countries included in each estimation is 67, 192, and 172 respectively. Statistical significance: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Interest rate is like hot air: it pushes debt-to-GDP up

GDP growth is like the sand bags: it helps bring the debt-to-GDP down

If interest rate  $>$  GDP growth, debt-to-GDP tend to  $\uparrow$  If interest rate  $<$  GDP growth, debt-to-GDP tend to

# Debt Dynamics—Useful Formulas

# Decomposition of debt dynamics:

From  $d_{t} = \frac{1 + r}{1 + g} d_{t - 1} - p b_{t}$  the change in debt becomes

$$
d _ {t} - d _ {t - 1} = \frac {r - g}{1 + g} d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t}
$$

One can attribute the change in debt-to-GDP to:

- Interest rates  $\frac{r}{1 + g} d_{t - 1}$  
Growth  $-\frac{g}{1 + g} d_{t - 1}$  
Fiscal policy  $- p b_{t}$

# Debt Dynamics—Useful Formulas

# The debt-stabilizing primary balance:

If government wants to keep debt stable so that  $d_{t} = d_{t - 1}$  then:

$$
d _ {t - 1} = \frac {1 + r}{1 + g} d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad p b _ {t} = \frac {1 + r}{1 + g} d _ {t - 1} - d _ {t - 1}
$$

$$
p b _ {t} = \frac {r - g}{1 + g} d _ {t - 1}
$$

- The larger the difference between  $r$  and  $g$  and the larger the initial debt, the greater the primary surplus/deficit needed to stabilize the debt  
- One can revert the formula to compute at which level debt will stabilize if a certain balance was kept forever

# Debt Dynamics—Useful Formulas

# Deriving the primary balance for targeting a debt level:

Consider the formula of the debt dynamic:

$$
d _ {t} = \left(\frac {1 + r}{1 + g}\right) d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t} \quad d _ {t} = \beta d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t}
$$

Starting from  $d_0$ :  $d_1 = \beta d_0 - p b_1$ $d_2 = \beta^2 d_0 - \beta p b_1 - p b_2$

$$
d _ {3} = \beta^ {3} d _ {0} - \beta p b _ {1} - \beta p b _ {2} - p b _ {3} \quad \dots \quad d _ {t} = \beta^ {t} d _ {0} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {t} \beta^ {t - i} p b _ {i}
$$

Given  $d_0$ : What will debt be if the  $pb$  is kept constant forever?

Given  $d_0$ : What is the constant  $pb$  that allows reaching a target debt to GDP  $d^*$  in  $T$  years?

# Debt Dynamics—Useful Formulas

# Deriving the primary balance for targeting a debt level:

From  $d_{t} = \beta^{t}d_{0} - \sum_{i = 1}^{t}\beta^{t - i}pb_{i}$  it follows that

$$
d _ {t} = \beta^ {t} d _ {0} - p b \frac {1 - \beta^ {t}}{1 - \beta}
$$

If  $\beta < 1$  then debt will eventually converge to

$$
d ^ {*} = - p b \frac {1}{1 - \beta}
$$

The constant  $pb$  that allows reaching a target debt to GDP  $d^{*}$

in  $T$  years is

$$
p b = \frac {1 - \beta}{1 - \beta^ {t}} \left(\beta^ {t} d _ {0} - d ^ {*}\right)
$$

# Debt Dynamics—Useful Formulas

# Adding foreign currency/external debt:

Suppose part of debt is denominated in foreign currency. Let:

- $e_t$  be the exchange rate at time  $t$  (units of local currency per 1 unit of foreign currency)  
- $i^F$  be the interest rate on foreign currency denominated debt, including risk premium  
- $D_{t}$  be total debt,  $D_{t}^{N}$  be debt denominated in local currency, and  $D_{t}^{F}$  be the local currency value of the debt denominated in foreign currency

With this notation, the debt stock comprising domestic and foreign-currency debt can be written as:

$$
D _ {t} = D _ {t} ^ {N} + e _ {t} D _ {t} ^ {F}
$$

$D^{N} =$  Local currency-denominated debt

$DF =$  Foreign currency-denominated debt

$e =$  Nominal exchange rate (local currency per  $\S$ )

# Debt Dynamics—Useful Formulas

# Adding foreign currency/external debt (continued):

Let  $\varepsilon_{t}$  be the exchange rate depreciation and  $\alpha_{t}$  be the share of debt denominated in foreign currency to total debt

$$
D _ {t} = (1 + i) \left(1 - \alpha_ {t - 1}\right) D _ {t - 1} + \left(1 + i ^ {F}\right) \left(1 + \varepsilon_ {t}\right) \alpha_ {t - 1} D _ {t - 1} - P B _ {t}
$$

Expressing all nominal variables in terms of GDP this becomes:

$$
d _ {t} = \left[ (1 + i) \left(1 - \alpha_ {t - 1}\right) + \left(1 + i ^ {F}\right) \left(1 + \varepsilon_ {t}\right) \alpha_ {t - 1} \right] \frac {d _ {t - 1}}{1 + n} - p b _ {t}
$$

$$
1 + \left(i \left(1 - \alpha_ {t - 1}\right) + i ^ {F} \alpha_ {t - 1}\right) + \left(1 + i ^ {F}\right) \varepsilon_ {t} \alpha_ {t}
$$

$$
d _ {t} = \frac {1 + i ^ {*}}{1 + n} d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t} + \frac {\left(1 + i ^ {F}\right)}{1 + n} \varepsilon_ {t} \alpha_ {t - 1} d _ {t - 1}
$$

Average interest rate  $(i^{*})$

Equation similar to previous, except for effect of  $\varepsilon$  on interest payment and stock of debt

# Debt Dynamics

# Adding foreign currency/external debt (continued):

Remembering that we could rewrite

$$
d _ {t} = \left(\frac {1 + i}{1 + n}\right) d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t} \quad \text {a s}
$$

$$
d _ {t} = \left(\frac {1 + r}{1 + g} d _ {t - 1}\right) - p b _ {t}
$$

We can express the corresponding formula with foreign currency debt as

$$
d _ {t} = \left(\frac {1 + r ^ {*}}{1 + g} d _ {t - 1} - p b _ {t} + \frac {\left(1 + i ^ {F}\right)}{1 + n} \varepsilon_ {t} \alpha_ {t - 1} d _ {t - 1} \right.
$$

# Debt Analysis

# Debt Sustainability Analysis

# Basic approach:

Project debt in the medium and long term under:

- Current fiscal policy, including announced changes that will credibly be implemented  
- Projections on long-term interest rates, growth rates, exchange rate, composition of debt, etc.

Consider also the major fiscal and macroeconomic vulnerabilities and project debt under different shocks scenarios:

- Increase interest rates  
Decrease growth  
Depreciation  
- Materialize contingent liabilities  
- Worse fiscal balances

Is debt sustainable under current policies? Does it explode? Will it stay below or breach comfortable levels under shocks?

# Debt thresholds in IMF/WB DSA for LICs:

Countries operating in a weaker institutional and policy environment are likely to experience debt distress at significantly lower debt ratios.

# Debt Sustainability Analysis

# What are Present Values (PVs)?

- Debt stock can be thought of as the sum of all future principal (amortization) payments  
- Present value is the sum of all future discounted debt service payments  
- Why are PVs used? Because they capture the concessionality of debt:

A loan that is repaid in 40 years, at a low interest rate, is much less burdensome than a loan that has to be repaid next year at a high interest rate.  

- The nominal debt stock computed today is indifferent between these two loans if the outstanding debt is the same, but the PV captures that the first loan is less burdensome.

# An Introduction to Financial Programming

Carlos G Fernández Valdovinos

Spring 2023

# Introduction

Financial Programming (FP) is a framework used to design a set of macroeconomic policies aimed at achieving or maintaining macroeconomic stability objectives. (IMF, 2015)

# Three steps for (FP)

- Diagnose the economy by looking macroeconomic accounts  
Projection of economic variables  
Design of policies to achieve objectives

Financial programming is a tool for ensuring accounting and economic consistency in economic analysis and projections.

Accounting consistency: One variable per sector as residual. Also cross-checks across accounts.

Economic consistency: What is the "story"? Does it make sense? What policies are assumed?

# GIVEN INCONSISTENCIES, CHOICES MUST BE MADE.

# What is Financial Programming?

In a nutshell, it is what the IMF does……

To forecast the macroeconomy  
$\succ$  With the objective of helping to preserve macroeconomic stability

# External Sector

External sector refers to transactions with "the rest of the world" or non-residents of a country.

The interaction between an economy and the rest of the world includes: (i) goods and services transactions; and (ii) financial transactions.

# Balance of Payment (BOP) Records

# Real transactions

Flows of goods, services, and income, including transfers.

-Current Account

a. Account on goods  
b. Account on services  
c. Factor income account  
d. Current transfers account

# Financial transactions

Transactions in assets, and the creation, repayment or extinction of claims and liabilities.

Financial or Capital Account

a. Direct investments  
b. Portfolio investments  
c. Other investment  
d. Reserve assets

# Double-Entry Accounting

The BOP records both sides of a transaction: (i) the value of what is transacted; (ii) how it is paid.

# Credits (+)

- Exports of goods & services  
- Return accrued for providing labor, financial assets, and natural resources to nonresidents.  
- Disposal of assets (gold and claims) on the world  
- Incurrence of liabilities to the world  
Donations received

# Debits (-)

- Imports of goods & services  
- Return payable for using labor, financial assets, and natural resources for non-residents.  
Acquisition of assets (gold and claims) on the world  
Decrease in liabilities to the world  
Donations made

However, in practice the sum of credits is not equal to the sum of debits, thus there is an account called Errors and Omissions to compensate for the differences.

Balance of Payment = Current Account + Capital Account

$$
B O P = C A B + K A B
$$

# Current Account = Trade in Goods + Trade in Services + Net Current Transfers + Net Factor Income

$$
T r a d e \quad i n \quad G o o d s = (X _ {g o o d s} - M _ {g o o d s})
$$

$$
\text {T r a d e i n S e r v i c e s} = \left(X _ {\text {s e r v i c e s}} - M _ {\text {s e r v i c e s}}\right)
$$

$$
\text {C u r r e n t A c c o u n t} = X - M + N C T + N F I
$$

$$
C A B = X - M + N C T + N F I
$$

# Kapital Account Balance = Net Official Foreign Financing + Net Private Capital Flows + Net Short Term Capital Flows

$$
K A B = N O F F + N P K F + N S T K F
$$

Finally,

$$
\text {B a l a n c e o f P a y m e n t} = \text {C A B} + \text {K A B}
$$

$$
B O P = C A B + K A B
$$

$$
B O P = C A B + E x t. F i n. G o v. + E x t. F i n. P r v. S e c t o r
$$

$$
B O P = - \Delta N e t F o r g i n A s s e t s
$$

(i) Current Account deficits means a country spends more (less) on goods of other countries that it receives.  
(ii) A current account deficit needs to be financed, therefore implying a capital inflow.  
(iii) If normal flows don't cover the deficit in CA, then the finance is done by using reserves or via official financing, for instance from the IMF.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP): the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.

Gross National Income (GNI) measures production or income that is earned using a country's resources.

Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) is the total income available to residents for either final consumption or saving.

$$
G D P = C + I + (X - M)
$$

GNI = GDP + Factor Income from Nonresidents – Factor Income to Nonresidents

GNI = GDP + Net Factor Income from Nonresidents

GNDI = GNI + Current Transfers from Nonresidents – Current Transfers to Nonresidents

GNDI = GNI + Net Current Transfers from Nonresidents

# Government Sector

# Government sector refers to real and financial transactions of the government in a given country.

# The Government Sector Activities

- Collect taxes (revenues)  
- Produce goods and services (non-market)  
- Redistribute wealth  
Financing (to/from other sectors of the economy)

# Four key accounting principles:

- Coverage: General Government & Public Corporations  
- Accrual Basis: flows are recorded when the transaction is made, not necessarily when payments are made  
- Consolidation: transactions between units of the same sector should be netted out to reflect transactions with other sectors  
- Valuation: at market value

# Flow of Funds

The links between the four different sectors could be systematically described in a flow of funds account.

The flow of funds account provides a comprehensive framework for describing the interrelations among macroeconomic accounts.

# KEYIDEAS

Sectors engage in non-financial transactions & financial transactions.

For each sector, the sum of all transactions (financial and non-financial) is zero.

For a given transaction, the sum across all sectors is zero.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/e320e3ce-bce3-4ea4-b81b-eb889a99b911/b310185251882af88899c4877d86b3148abc89f3aa21be43819effe2a14d7ce9.jpg)

The flow of funds table is a matrix: columns represent the four different sectors while rows represent the different type of transactions.

Each column add-up to zero: sum of non-financial and financial transactions for a sector is zero.

Each row add-up to zero: increased liabilities (more spending) for a given sector is equal to increased assets (less spending) of other sector.
