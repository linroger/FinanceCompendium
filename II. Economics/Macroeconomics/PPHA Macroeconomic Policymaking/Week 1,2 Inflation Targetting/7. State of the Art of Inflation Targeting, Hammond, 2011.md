# State of the Art of Inflation Targeting, Hammond, 2011

**Centre for Central Banking Studies**

**State of the art inflation targeting**

**Gill Hammond**

BANK OF ENGLAND

Inflation targeting has been adopted by an increasing number of central banks as their monetary policy framework. At the start of 2012, some 27 central banks were considered fully fledged inflation targets, and several others were in the process of establishing a full inflation-targeting regime.

This Handbook details the salient features of the inflation-targeting frameworks in place in all 27 inflation-targeting central banks. The Handbook was originally published in 2009 and is updated at the start of each year to reflect any changes to the country frameworks over the preceding twelve months. During 2011, there were few changes to central banks' formal inflation-targeting frameworks. However central banks continued to use unconventional monetary policy and new instruments. The financial stability remit of central banks was also given greater emphasis.

The individual country data enable us to analyse the state of the art of inflation targeting: the design features of inflation targets; the decision-making process; the legal, institutional and accountability arrangements; the models and forecasts used in central banks and their communication strategies.
