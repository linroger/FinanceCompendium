# State of the art of inflation targeting

Gill Hammond

gill.hammond@bankofengland.co.uk

Inflation targeting has been adopted by an increasing number of central banks as their monetary policy framework. At the start of 2012, some 27 central banks were considered fully fledged inflation targets, and several others were in the process of establishing a full inflation-targeting regime.

This Handbook details the salient features of the inflation-targeting frameworks in place in all 27 inflation-targeting central banks. The Handbook was originally published in 2009 and is updated at the start of each year to reflect any changes to the country frameworks over the preceding twelve months. During 2011, there were few changes to central banks' formal inflation-targeting frameworks. However central banks continued to use unconventional monetary policy and new instruments. The financial stability remit of central banks was also given greater emphasis.

The individual country data enable us to analyse the state of the art of inflation targeting: the design features of inflation targets; the decision-making process; the legal, institutional and accountability arrangements; the models and forecasts used in central banks and their communication strategies.

# State of the art of inflation targeting

# Development of inflation targeting as a monetary policy framework

# Definition of inflation targeting

Inflation targeting is a framework rather than a rigid set of rules for monetary policy. Nonetheless there are a number of essential elements of an inflation-targeting regime:

1. Price stability is explicitly recognised as the main goal of monetary policy.(1)  
2. There is a public announcement of a quantitative target for inflation.  
3. Monetary policy is based on a wide set of information, including an inflation forecast.  
4. Transparency.  
5. Accountability mechanisms.

A major advantage of inflation targeting is that it combines elements of both 'rules' and 'discretion' in monetary policy, and is therefore often characterised as 'constrained discretion'. King (2005) noted that 'An inflation-targeting framework combines two distinct elements: (a) a precise numerical target for inflation in the medium term and (b) a response to economic shocks in the short term. The inflation target provides a rule-like framework on which the private sector can anchor its expectations about future inflation'. Within this rule-like framework, the central bank has discretion in reacting to shocks, for example in how quickly to bring inflation back to target.

Woodford (2003) and Svensson (2007) show that the objectives of inflation targeting can be approximated by a quadratic loss function consisting of the sum of the square of inflation deviations from target and a weight times the square of the output gap. In practice, the respective weights given to stabilising inflation and stabilising output are likely to vary over time. They are also likely to depend on the credibility of the central bank; when a central bank is trying to establish credibility, a greater weight will be put on stabilising inflation.

# Conceptual and practical development of inflation targeting

Many central banks adopted inflation targeting as a pragmatic response to the failure of other monetary policy regimes, rather than in response to new economic thinking. Theory and practice have developed together over the past couple of decades, and there is now a large body of academic literature on inflation targeting.(2)

To achieve price stability, monetary policy requires a nominal anchor. By nominal anchor, we mean fixing a nominal variable in order to tie down the price level in the long run.

Historically, the nominal anchor used by central banks was the gold standard or pegging the domestic currency to another strong currency. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the 1970s, combined with high inflation, led to a search for new anchors, notably the money supply. During the 1980s, monetarism was the prevailing monetary policy orthodoxy, as central banks attempted to control prices by controlling the supply of money in the economy. This depended on the existence of a stable relationship between nominal expenditure and the quantity of money; known as the Quantity Theory of Money. Milton Friedman elaborated on the quantity theory and argued that the demand for money depended predictably on a number of macroeconomic variables. Thus central banks could control spending and inflation by altering the supply of money in the economy.

Friedman's fixed money rule implied that central banks should calculate the money supply based on its relationship to macroeconomic variables to target a specific rate of inflation. Under this rule, there is little discretion for the central bank to use its judgement in assessing the supply of money needed in the economy. In practice, successful monetary targets actively took account of the variability in the money supply and economic relationships. Bernanke argues that inflation targeting owes much to the pragmatic way that the Bundesbank conducted monetary policy in the 1980s: 'the Bundesbank indirectly targeted inflation, using money growth as a quantitative indicator to aid in the calibration of its policy. Notably when conflicts arose between its money growth targets and inflation targets, the Bundesbank generally chose to give greater weight to its inflation targets', (Bernanke and Mihov (1997)).

Ultimately monetary targeting failed in many countries as the demand for money function was not stable. This instability resulted typically from deregulation plus financial innovation; new types of money-like assets together with disintermediation from banking system. As John Crow, former Governor of the Bank of Canada famously commented: 'we did not abandon monetary aggregates, they abandoned us'.

The failure of money targeting in the mid-1980s and the collapse of fixed exchange rate pegs in the early 1990s was followed by the emergence of inflation targeting with floating exchange rates as the new monetary policy framework of choice. The framework was consistent with the main tenets of the prevailing academic consensus of the time about what monetary policy can and cannot do.

What does monetary theory tell us? First, as both Friedman and Phelps showed, a permanently higher rate of inflation does not lead to higher growth and employment. Acceptance of this concept supported a move away from monetary policy as tool of short-term demand management, or fine tuning, to a focus on the medium-term goal of price stability, which lies at the heart of inflation targeting.(1) Second, there has been an increasing recognition of the benefits of low and stable inflation — and equally an awareness of the costs of inflation; low inflation is a social good. In inflation-targeting regimes, price stability is the primary objective for central banks. Third, the literature increasingly stressed the importance of inflation expectations in monetary policy. The effect of monetary policy decisions on private sector expectations became an important consideration for policymakers.

Against this evolving consensus among economists, inflation targeting was seen as an effective way of anchoring inflation expectations.

# Empirical studies on inflation targeting

There are a number of studies comparing the performance of inflation-targeting central banks with non-inflation targets. Ball and Sheridan (2003) compared monetary policy outcomes in OECD countries and found that those with a history of high inflation before the 1990s subsequently experienced a larger degree of disinflation than countries with a history of low inflation. They argued that 'Once one controls for regression to the mean, there is no evidence that inflation targeting improves performance'.

Other studies find the opposite. Hyvonen (2004) extended the Ball and Sheridan analysis and found that the adoption of inflation targeting at least partly contributed to inflation convergence in the 1990s. Vega and Winkelried (2005) found that inflation targeting helped reduce the level and volatility of inflation in the countries that adopted it.

While the evidence on whether inflation targets have outperformed non-inflation targets by delivering price stability is not conclusive, there is more robust empirical evidence that a quantitative target for inflation can inform and anchor inflation expectations. Orphanides and Williams (2003) showed that the systematic approach to policy that characterises inflation targeting makes it predictable and results in more influence over expectations. By examining the extent to which expected inflation moves in response to economic news, Levin et al (2004) find evidence

that inflation persistence is lower, and expectations better anchored, in inflation-targeting countries.(2)

There is some empirical evidence on the performance of inflation targeting in emerging market economies. Research from the IMF(3) found that 'inflation targeting appears to have been associated with lower inflation, lower inflation expectations and lower inflation volatility relative to countries that have not adopted it'. Moreover these gains in inflation performance were achieved with no adverse effects on output and interest rate volatility. The IMF also considered which monetary policy frameworks had been most successful in anchoring inflation expectations in the wake of the oil and food price shocks in 2007, concluding that 'in emerging economies, inflation targeting seems to have recently been more effective than alternative monetary policy frameworks in anchoring expectations'.(4)

More recently, Rogers (2010) found that inflation targeting proved resilient in the financial crisis while Carvalho-Filho (2010) suggested that the monetary policy of inflation targets appeared to be more suited to dealing with the crisis.

Empirical evidence on the performance of inflation targeting is not unanimous but broadly supportive of the effectiveness of the framework in delivering low inflation and anchoring inflation expectations in both industrialised and emerging market economies. However there is an important point to be made about endogeneity. Many countries that adopted inflation targeting did so as part of a wider process of political and economic reform. Often this involved moves to strengthen the institutional structure of policymaking, for example giving statutory independence to the central bank.

In some countries, the adoption of inflation targeting as a new monetary policy framework was also accompanied by better fiscal policies (notably in Latin American countries). The adoption of inflation targeting has often been accompanied by a building up of technical capacity within the central bank, and an improvement in the quality of macroeconomic data. As inflation targeting depends to a large extent on the interest rate channel to transmit monetary policy, some emerging market economies also took steps to strengthen and develop the financial sector. It seems likely therefore that the improvement in monetary policy outcomes after the adoption of inflation targeting reflects improved economic policymaking in a broader sense.(5)

# Fully fledged inflation targets

The set of inflation-targeting central banks is very heterogeneous, including nine industrialised and 18 developing and emerging market countries from every continent. The first country to adopt inflation targeting was New Zealand in December 1989, and the most recent Serbia, in 2009. The only central banks to have exited from inflation targeting are Finland, Spain and Slovakia, in each case when they adopted the euro. Some countries adopted inflation targeting while they were transition economies; the Czech Republic, Hungary Poland and latterly Armenia. Several emerging market countries adopted inflation targeting in the wake of the 1997 crisis, which forced a number of currencies off their fixed exchange rate pegs.

Chart 1 also illustrates that most countries adopted inflation targeting when inflation was already low (and indeed negative in Peru). This supports the argument that inflation targeting may not be the optimal monetary policy regime for bringing inflation down, but it has proved effective at anchoring inflation expectations around the target, and so keeping inflation low and stable.

The main reason why low inflation is often regarded as a 'precondition' for inflation targeting is the difficulty of forecasting inflation, and hitting an inflation target, in conditions of high and volatile inflation. The central bank risks losing credibility from target misses in such circumstances. This explains why many central banks waited until inflation was under control before formally introducing inflation targeting. However the experience of Israel and Guatemala shows that inflation targeting has successfully been used as a

disinflationary strategy. (In the case of Israel, with an informal inflation-targeting regime.)

# Inflation-targeting frameworks

# Legal mandate and central bank independence

Most definitions of inflation targeting include the requirement that price stability is the main goal of monetary policy. This is usually enshrined in the central bank law. In many cases the central bank law also states that, as a subsidiary objective, the central bank will support economic prosperity and welfare more broadly. The individual country tables show considerable diversity in the precise legal mandates of inflation targets. Australia has a dual mandate for price stability and employment, for example, while in Canada the main role of the central bank is 'to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada'. In the wake of the financial crisis that started in 2007, the legal mandates of several central banks, including the Bank of England, have been expanded to include a financial stability remit.

Most inflation-targeting central banks have statutory independence.(2) The literature on central bank independence often distinguishes between 'goal independence' ie the central bank has autonomy in setting the objective of monetary policy, and 'instrument independence', ie the central bank conducts monetary policy to achieve the inflation objective independent of government influence. In practice the distinction is less clear-cut. The ultimate goal of monetary policy, ie price stability, is, as we have seen, usually enshrined in law. 'Goal independence' then becomes a second-order question of defining 'price stability' ie setting the inflation target.(3)

When inflation is not at its steady state, as was the case in several emerging market countries when they adopted inflation targeting, setting the inflation target and determining the path and pace of disinflation are clearly more substantial policy questions. The ability to set the inflation target was seen as an essential part of central bank independence. On the other hand, it is clearly beneficial for the government to make an explicit commitment to the inflation target, which is more likely when the target is jointly determined, in order to promote better co-ordination — or at least no conflict — between fiscal and monetary policy. And government involvement in setting the target adds democratic legitimacy to the policy, which can help command public support.

(1) Chart 1 shows the date of formal adoption of inflation targeting. Several countries had pursued a form of implicit or informal inflation targeting before the formal start date.  
(2) The Central Bank of Brazil is the exception to the general rule; it does not have statutory independence; neither do the Governors or Deputy Governors have fixed terms of appointment.  
(3) The European Central Bank (ECB) is regarded as one of the most independent central banks. Here, the goal of monetary policy is set out in the Treaty and Statutes of the ESCB as price stability. The role of the ECB has been to define price stability, currently a level of inflation 'below but close to'  $2\%$  per annum.

For inflation targeting the key requirement is instrument or operational independence. All 27 inflation-targeting central banks have operational independence. $^{(1)}$  In the majority of inflation-targeting countries — 15 out of 27 — the inflation target is jointly determined by the government and central bank. In nine cases the central bank sets the target, and in three cases, Norway, South Africa and the United Kingdom, the target is set by the government (Chart 2). Among the nine industrialised countries, Sweden is the only country in which the government is not involved, either solely or in conjunction with the central bank, in setting the target.

Chart 2 Who sets the inflation target?

The inflation targets of industrialised countries all lie between  $1\%$  and  $3\%$  (year-on-year increase in inflation). This reflects the consensus interpretation of the general range of inflation that is consistent with price stability in these countries. It would be difficult therefore for governments in these countries to adopt a higher inflation target as this would undermine credibility. So, even where the target is set by the government alone, in practice, in industrialised countries, the government is highly constrained in setting an operational definition of price stability.

It would appear de jure that central banks in developing and emerging markets have a greater degree of independence: in eight cases, mainly in Latin American countries,(2) the target is determined solely by the central bank, while in the other nine cases the target is jointly determined. De facto, the picture is more complex. In Colombia and Guatemala, for example, the Minister of Finance sits on the decision-making board of the central bank, so there is some government influence on setting the target.

# What level should the target be?

There is some mismatch between theory and practice here. Theory suggests that the optimal inflation rate should be zero (in the New Keynesian paradigm), or negative (according to the Friedman Rule).<sup>(3)</sup> In practice, all inflation-targeting

central banks have positive targets. How can we explain the discrepancy between theory and practice? The reasons would seem to be largely practical.

The first reason is purely statistical. Measured inflation tends to overstate actual inflation by around 0.5 percentage points,(4) so a margin above zero is required to compensate for this effect. Another argument is that a positive inflation target decreases the probability of hitting the zero lower bound on nominal rates, a point that had operational importance in the global economic slowdown experienced in 2008-09. It is likely that the costs of deflation are greater than the costs of inflation, so a positive inflation target is desirable to avoid the risk of deflation, and the resulting debt-deflation.(5) In addition, the conventional wisdom in recent years has been that a positive inflation target is desirable if there is downward nominal wage resistance. Interestingly, early evidence during the economic recession of 2008-09 suggests that wages were more downwardly flexible than previously supposed.(6)

Given the lack of a precise definition of price stability, central banks have focused on reducing inflation to a level where people do not worry about it. The consensus seems to be that above a threshold of around  $3\% - 4\%$ , inflation imposes welfare costs, while the plausible gains from reducing inflation below about  $2\%$  are unlikely to outweigh the advantages of a positive inflation target.

There is even less guidance in the literature on the optimal level of inflation in developing and emerging countries, though Balassa-Samuelson effects imply that optimal inflation in these countries should be a little higher than in industrialised countries.

Table A shows the numerical inflation targets in place at the start of 2012. Industrialised countries all have inflation targets between  $1\%$  and  $3\%$ . Korea is at the top of this narrow range, with a target of  $3\%$  plus or minus one percentage point. Some non-industrialised countries also have inflation targets in this range;  $2\%$  in Peru;  $2\%$  in the Czech Republic and  $2.5\%$  in Poland. A further three countries — Chile, Hungary and Mexico — have a target of  $3\%$  and Colombia had a target range of  $2\%-4\%$ . Only one country had a target above  $5\%$ , namely Ghana with a target of  $8.7\%$ .

(1) An exception to the rule was the United Kingdom experience between 1992 and 1997 when interest rate decisions were made by government.  
(2) Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Guatemala, Hungary, Mexico, Peru and Poland.  
(3) Phelps argued that the Friedman rule ignores the effects of taxation: inflation is a source of tax revenue. At low rates of inflation, distortions associated with the inflation tax might be minor.  
(4) The Boskin Commission in 1996 found that CPI in the United States overstated inflation by around 1.1 percentage points in 1996. The Bank of England estimated bias in the United Kingdom to be between 0.5 percentage point and 0.75 percentage point. See Bank of England Working Paper no. 47.  
(5) Deflation means that the nominal value of assets falls, but the nominal value of debt does not. So the real cost of servicing debt increases.

# Target horizon

The target horizon tends to depend on whether inflation is within the price stability range. In the 19 countries with inflation targets of  $3\%$  or less, the target horizon tends to be medium term (this includes target horizons of two years or more, and those specified as 'at all times'). Medium-term targets have the advantage of anchoring inflation expectations, and explicitly allowing for short-term divergences from the target when shocks hit the economy. The target horizon may also depend on the length of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. With a longer transmission mechanism, the central bank is not able to affect inflation in the short run.

Where a disinflationary strategy is employed, inflation targets are often set annually. In emerging markets, there is often a quicker pass through from policy rates to inflation, so a shorter policy horizon is warranted. And an annual target is often seen as good for accountability. Countries on a disinflationary path will often also indicate the medium-term target in order to anchor inflation expectations.

# Target measure

All 27 inflation targets use the consumer prices index (CPI) as their operational target, and all now use the headline rather than the core measure. This is largely for practical and operational reasons: CPI is available on a monthly basis,

whereas other measure, which may be preferred for theoretical reasons, such as the GDP deflator, are only available quarterly. While a core measure is less volatile and may be more responsive to the policy rate, the headline measure has the overwhelming advantage of being familiar to the public. Korea used a core measure of inflation for the target measure from 2000–06(1) and then reverted to headline CPI. Moreover, measures of core inflation often exclude food as a volatile component. In some developing countries food can be around  $40\%$  of the CPI basket and excluding it would simply lack credibility.

While headline CPI is the preferred target measure, many central banks also look at measures of core inflation as an indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Ghana, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Turkey all publish forecasts of core inflation in addition to headline inflation.(2) The shocks to oil and food prices in 2007 demonstrated the importance of interpreting core inflation measures with care. The rises in prices of food and utilities led to falls in income available for consumption of other goods and services, which in turn helped keep price rises in these sectors (core inflation) subdued. But it would have been misleading to interpret the low levels of core inflation solely as reflecting subdued underlying inflation; core inflation must be interpreted in the light of what is happening in the economy as a whole.

# Point or range targets?

Point targets for inflation, including point targets with tolerance bands, have the advantage of being very precise and giving a clear signal to the markets of the central bank's objective. They can also have the advantage of being symmetric, which helps communicate the central bank's desire to avoid deflation as robustly as it avoids inflation. This has been important at times when the threat of deflation has been a concern. A point target can also help convey the medium-term nature of the objective: it is obviously impossible for inflation to hit the point target month in month out. Finally, a point target may be preferable when the volatility of inflation outturns is wider than the width of a narrow band.

With a target range it is very clear whether the target has been hit or missed. Ranges can also convey the sense that the central bank has imprecise control over the inflation objective, and that the central bank can accommodate temporary shocks to price level. In the same way, a target range allows a degree of output stabilisation.

In practice the majority of central banks, particularly those adopting inflation targeting later, have opted for the best of both worlds, with 17 inflation targets expressing the target as a point with a tolerance band. Five central banks (Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Sweden $^{(3)}$  and the United Kingdom) $^{(4)}$  have

simple point targets while the other five countries have a target range.

# Decision-making under inflation targeting

This section looks at the decision-making process in inflation-targeting central banks. In most cases a decision-making committee meets regularly at pre-announced rates meetings to decide what interest rates (or other policy measures) are necessary to achieve the inflation target. But there are many variations on the model.

# Decision-making body

Inflation targets tend to make decisions by committee. Even in New Zealand where the Governor is the sole decision-maker, the Official Cash Rate Advisory Group (OCRAG), including two external appointees, serves in an advisory role. In Israel, where the Governor had formerly been the sole decision-maker, a new law was passed in 2010 to create a Monetary Committee with six members. (See page 30 for details). In thirteen countries the policy decision is taken by the Board of the central bank and in eleven countries the MPC decides on interest rates. The rationale for a separate MPC is usually to delegate the monetary policy decision to monetary policy experts. In the United Kingdom, the law requires all MPC members to be appointed on the basis of their experience or expertise in monetary policy. In some countries, such as Armenia and the Philippines, there is a two-stage process under which an internal MPC or Advisory Committee of technical experts makes recommendations to the Board, which is formally responsible for monetary policy decisions.

# Size and composition of committee

The average size of decision-making committee is seven people, and this does not seem to be related to the size of the economy. Poland has the largest committee of ten; several central banks have five members on their committee. There is no clear pattern on the composition of the Board or MPC, with some committees staffed by internal central bank officials, and an equal number by central bank experts plus external appointees (Table B). In a minority of cases (including Colombia, Guatemala and the Philippines) the government is represented on the decision-making body. In other cases, a member of government attends as an observer, without the right to vote (Hungary, Romania, Turkey and the United Kingdom).

(2) The RBA looks at a range of measures of underlying inflation, but its preferred measures are trimmed mean measures which, while downweighting the effect of large changes in fuel and food do not exclude them. In the Czech Republic the core measure is a measure of monetary policy relevant inflation, ie headline inflation adjusted for first round effects of changes in indirect taxes.  
(3) Sweden dropped the tolerance bands around its point target in 2010.  
(4) In the United Kingdom there is a requirement if inflation is more than 1 percentage point away from target for the Bank of England to write an open letter. But this is an accountability mechanism and not a target range.

# Decision-making process

A majority of inflation targets — 18 of the 26 — determine monetary policy by majority vote, rather than arriving at a consensus decision.(1) The Governor, as chairperson, usually has the casting vote. Eight central banks arrive at a consensus decision, and in New Zealand the Governor is the sole decision-maker (Charts 3 and 4).

# Frequency of decision-making

Most decision-making bodies meet between eight and twelve times per year. Monthly meetings are common, and fit well with the monthly release of data. In normal times, six-weekly meetings are usually sufficient to take account of the news. In exceptional times, the committee may meet more frequently. In our sample, fourteen central banks meet 11-12 times per year and ten meet 8-9 times per year, while in

Ghana, Norway, South Africa and Sweden the MPC meets six times per year.

# Models and forecasts

# Models used for monetary policy

Inflation targeting requires strong technical capacity in the central bank to model the economy, understand the transmission mechanism and forecast inflation and output. Most inflation-targeting central banks use a suite of models approach (Table C), including statistical and spreadsheet forecasts, structural, macroeconomic and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Some models are theoretically based, while others are more data driven. Some

are better suited to short-term projections and others for longer-term forecast horizons. By using a suite of different models, central banks can draw both on theory and data, plus, of course, a large element of judgment, to inform policymaking.

Spreadsheet forecasts are typically used to make monthly projections of CPI over the near term (up to six months). They can incorporate information (eg on administered prices) and expert judgement on the individual components of CPI. Small-scale econometric models such as vector autoregressions (VARs) and error correction models use information in macroeconomic data to project future developments and tend to be used for projections six to twelve months ahead. The usefulness of these models depends on the quality of the data; they are less useful when there has been rapid transformation in the economy such that the past is a less reliable guide to the future.(1)

Small structural models, typically of four to six equations, have some theoretical underpinning, are tractable for forecasting purposes and also have some empirical basis. In recent years

many central banks have added a DSGE model to their suite. These models have strong microfoundations $^{(2)}$  and are among the most theoretically coherent of models. Another big advantage is that they include forward-looking behaviour, especially forward-looking inflation expectations, which as we have seen is a key variable for inflation targets. DSGE models are complex to build, however, and often need to be augmented with a number of ad hoc features in order to replicate stylised facts in the data.

# Forecasts

All inflation targets publish their forecasts of inflation, usually quarterly. Eight central banks (Australia, Canada, Ghana, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Romania and Thailand) also publish forecasts of core inflation. 16 publish GDP forecasts, and Norway and Romania publish forecasts of the output gap. A few central banks (the Czech Republic, Israel, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden) now publish projections for the policy interest rate.(3)

There are a number of separate issues here. The first is what broad type of interest rate assumption (constant or non-constant) is better for forecasting. Then there is the question of whether the time-varying path that is an input to the forecast should be model-based, market-based or based on judgement. Finally there is a separate question of communication. The question of how much a central bank should reveal about its expectations of future policy rates has been the subject of considerable debate.

There are a number of arguments in favour of a central bank publishing its own projection of interest rates. First, it can be seen as an extension of the transparent inflation-targeting framework. This will help anchor inflation expectations. Kahn (2007) argued that publishing the central bank's projections for interest rates may help markets price assets more efficiently, and Sellon (2008) found that in the United States, more explicit guidance on interest rates led to an improvement in private sector forecasts. Rosenberg (2008) found that in Sweden, the publication of the Executive Board's projection for the policy rate resulted in the Board being more involved in the forecast process.

There are equally powerful arguments against publishing the central bank's projection for policy rates. First, most central banks don't actually have a path to communicate. Many MPCs spend most of their time assessing the economic situation and outlook rather than the future path of interest rates. Goodhart (2001) makes a convincing argument on the

(1) In econometrics terms, where there are structural breaks in the data.  
(2) Microfounded models include microeconomic analysis of the behaviour of individual agents such as households and firms to underpin the macroeconomic theory.  
(3) Since January 2009, the Czech National Bank has also published projections for the exchange rate. In January 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York adopted an inflation goal of  $2\%$  and published forecasts for federal funds rate, though it did not formally adopt inflation targeting.

practical difficulty for a committee, particularly an individualistic committee, agreeing on an entire path for interest rates: do members vote for each month's decision? how then to aggregate these views? King (2007) suggested that markets need information on the MPC's contingent response to data as they evolve, rather than the MPC's projections of the policy rate. On a different tack, Kahn (2007) suggests that policymakers may feel tied in to a published projection and be less willing to change path in response to new information.

For some central banks, the key arguments against publishing a projection of the policy rate relate to the communication strategy, rather than technical factors. A real issue is whether markets, and more especially the general public, would understand the conditional nature of the interest rate projection, particularly as the central bank itself sets the policy rate. There is also the argument that publishing the policy rate projection could unhelpfully move the debate into aspects of forecasting and the interest rate path and away from the central message that the central bank wants to convey about meeting the inflation target.

A separate question is who owns the inflation forecast. The more clearly the policymaking body is seen to be associated with the forecast, the more directly it will be perceived as having an influence on policy. In general, decision-makers in inflation-targeting central banks tend to be very involved with the forecast: in fourteen cases the forecast is owned by the Board or MPC;(1) in six cases it is a central bank forecast and in seven cases a staff forecast.

# Accountability and transparency

# Mechanisms of accountability

There is a large literature on the relationship between central bank independence and accountability. Individual inflation-targeting frameworks often reflect strenuous attempts to balance the two, with detailed and sophisticated mechanisms to hold the central bank to account for its conduct of monetary policy. For the United Kingdom, Tucker (2007) details the reforms that were necessary in the early 1990s to ensure independence and accountability for the Bank of England, particularly given a prevailing view that 'it was a real obstacle to independence that the Bank would not be able to account for its monetary stewardship on the Floor of the House of Commons. In a Parliamentary system of democracy, it is Ministers who are accountable'. Similarly Reddell (2006) reveals the detailed monitoring system, both statutory and as it has evolved in practice, for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The legislation establishes clear roles for the Governor, the Minister of Finance and the Board of Directors under the Policy Target Agreement. The Board's role includes monitoring the role of the Governor who is formally held to account for the conduct of monetary policy.(2)

Specific forms of accountability to parliament have been put in place in inflation-targeting regimes, notably 'open letters' and parliamentary hearings. Open letters are usually letters written by the Governor on behalf of the MPC to the government in the event that inflation misses the inflation target by a pre-specified amount. The central bank is usually required to explain why inflation has missed the target, what action the central bank is taking to bring inflation back to target and when this is expected to happen. The open letter is designed to be part of the communication and accountability process, and not a 'censure' on the central bank. When the original framework for the Bank of England was put in place in 1997, it included a requirement for an open letter if inflation deviated from target by more than 1 percentage point in either direction. At the time, it was expected, on the basis of previous volatility in inflation, that an open letter would be required about  $40\%$  of the time (Bean (1998)). In the event, the volatility of inflation fell markedly and it took ten years before the first open letter was written in April 2007. Among our sample, seven central banks have an open letter as part of their accountability mechanisms(3) (Chart 5).

Another important accountability mechanism is parliamentary hearings, whereby the central bank appears before parliament to provide testimony on monetary policy. All industrialised countries, but only one half of emerging and developing countries have some form of parliamentary hearing as part of their inflation-targeting framework (Chart 5).

Open letters and parliamentary hearings are the main forms of accountability to parliament. There are also accountability mechanisms that hold the governor or MPC accountable to the

central bank Board and the central bank is ultimately accountable to the public. Public accountability is usually achieved through publications and the wider communication strategy.

# Publications and communications

Inflation targeting is a framework for making and communicating decisions. King (2005) op cit.

For central banks planning to introduce inflation targeting, establishing a strategic communications strategy is a key pre-requisite. Communication is an integral part of an inflation-targeting framework. Since the early 1990s, all

central banks have become more transparent, as openness has replaced mystique as a guide to monetary policy, but inflation targets are the most transparent (Geraats (2009)). Dincer and Eichengreen (2007) find that in their sample of 100 central banks the most transparent were the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of England, the Czech National Bank, the Bank of Canada, the ECB, and the Central Bank of the Philippines.

There has been some convergence on central bank communication. Most central banks communicate their monetary policy framework and objectives. Most publish their analysis of economic conditions, including the outlook for

growth and inflation, as well as the major risks to that outlook. And most central banks explain the reasons for their policy decision. The main differences in communication strategy lie in how much information is revealed about differences of opinion among decision-makers, and how much guidance, either explicit or implicit, is given about the future stance of policy (see the section on forecasts for a discussion on publishing a projection for policy rates).

For inflation targets, the main vehicle of communication is the Inflation Report. All 27 publish such a report, in the vast majority of cases quarterly (Table D). The Inflation Report usually presents the central bank's assessment of economic conditions and its view on prospects for inflation and growth, including its projections for these and other variables. The main upside and downside risks to the projections and alternative scenarios are often included (see Table C for details of published projections). The other main purpose of the Inflation Report is to explain the rationale behind recent monetary policy decisions.

Another important publication is the minutes of the policymaking meeting. Eighteen inflation targeters publish the minutes, usually after a lag of two to four weeks, though the Central Bank of Brazil and the Czech National Bank publish minutes eight days after the policy meeting. As Chart 6 shows, most but not all industrialised countries publish minutes, $^{(1)}$  and publication of minutes is becoming more common in emerging market countries, with two thirds now publishing minutes of the policy meeting. $^{(2)}$

Inflation targets in Europe are the most individualistic: of the 18 central banks that reach an interest rate decision by vote, six publish the individual votes; Chile, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, $^{(3)}$  Sweden and the United Kingdom. Brazil, Iceland and Thailand reveal the balance of the vote, and

Colombia reveals whether there was a unanimous or majority decision.

One reason for publishing individual votes is that this gives the markets more information on the policymakers' views. In the Bank of England, revealing individual votes also accords with the principle of individual accountability among MPC members. Publishing the balance of votes is an alternative way of providing information about the views on the committee without revealing the identities of voters. One argument for not revealing individual votes is that it may make it easier for members to change their position. Since details of the vote contain market sensitive information there is an argument for publishing it when the interest rate decision is announced, rather than subsequently when the minutes are published.

All inflation targeters publish details of the monetary policy decision (usually the interest rate) immediately after the policy meeting, and it is usual for a press release or notice to accompany the decision (Table D). In addition, 19 inflation targeters hold press conferences, either to explain the decision or on publication of the Inflation Report.

# Challenges for inflation targeting

Inflation targeting has been in existence for just over 20 years. During that time, frameworks have evolved, as has economic theory and consensus views on the objectives of monetary policy. The introduction of inflation targeting in many countries coincided with the 'great stability', a period characterised by moderate consumer price inflation and a reduction in the volatility of inflation and output. Following the financial crisis that started in 2007, inflation targets (and indeed all monetary policy makers) faced new and unprecedented challenges.

# Inflation targeting and financial stability

A key issue for central banks has been how to combine the goal of financial stability with the goal of price stability. It is clear that low and stable inflation does not guarantee financial stability. While there have been few changes to central banks' formal inflation-targeting frameworks, the role of financial stability has been strengthened in central banks, with some, like the Bank of England, introducing a new macroprudential policy framework to strengthen financial stability alongside the inflation-targeting framework.

# Inflation targeting and asset prices

While inflation targeting generally resulted in low and stable consumer prices in the 1990s and early part of the 2000s, asset prices were more volatile, and there were long-standing concerns about the build-up of money and credit in some economies. Against this background, a key issue facing central banks for some years has been whether and how they should take account of asset prices in monetary policy (see for example Borio and White (2004)). On the specific question of how inflation targets should respond to asset prices, Bean (2003) noted that 'a central bank seeking to stabilise inflation and output over a sufficiently long time horizon should necessarily aim to incorporate the possible adverse long term consequences of an asset price bubble in its deliberations'. This implies taking a longer time horizon for monetary policy decisions, beyond the one or two year horizon. For several years central banks such as the RBA have argued that central banks need to pay close attention to asset prices; what information they may contain about the stance of policy and the risks that may be building up. In Poland, the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2010 issued by the National Bank contain more explicit acknowledgement of asset prices in interest rate setting.

The financial crisis has challenged the conventional wisdom that monetary policy could not and should not attempt to burst asset price bubbles, but rather should be used energetically in the aftermath of the bubble bursting. Yet there is still no clear consensus on how proactively central banks should lean against the wind.

# Specification of the inflation target

The increased volatility in inflation since 2007 has led to some debate on the best target measure of inflation. There have been calls for the targets to explicitly include asset prices and particularly house prices. Others have argued in favour of targeting 'domestically generated inflation', in order to abstract from the headwinds and tailwinds of imported inflation. The fear of deflation led some to propose increasing the level of the target in order to avoid the zero bound. Others have suggested that, faced with below target inflation in the short run, the inflation target should be specified as an average over several years in order to anchor inflation expectations. Some have argued that this makes more sense with a price level target, and that a price level target would provide a stronger anchor for positive inflation expectations. On the

other hand, there are concerns that a price level target would be less effective in coping with persistent terms of trade stocks.

# Inflation targeting near the zero bound

The traditional instrument of monetary policy is interest rates. In 2009 and 2010, several central banks had reduced interest rates close to zero. Interest rates cannot usually be negative, so as further easing of monetary policy was required in order to achieve the inflation target, central banks used 'unconventional monetary policy'. This usually involves measures to increase the quantity of money or credit in the economy to provide an additional stimulus to nominal spending in order to meet the inflation target. In these operations, the central bank buys public and private sector assets using central bank money.

Some inflation-targeting central banks pursued unconventional monetary policies. The Bank of England began a programme of asset purchases in March 2009, $^{(1)}$  and the Bank of Canada published a framework for unconventional monetary policy under inflation targeting in their April 2009 Monetary Report, under which it made a conditional commitment to keep policy rates at the effective lower band until the second quarter of 2010. One benefit of the inflation-targeting framework is that monetary policy decisions are clearly linked to the inflation target. The inflation forecast provides a guide for the extent of quantitative easing that may be necessary and also the appropriate time to exit. The numerical target also provides a strong anchor for inflation expectations.

# Conclusion

Inflation targeting has been successfully practised in a growing number of countries in the past twenty years. This Handbook presents the main features of the frameworks in place in the 27 countries regarded as fully fledged inflation targets at the beginning of 2012. There is much common ground among inflation targets, but nonetheless individual frameworks reflect local economic, political and cultural factors. Inflation-targeting frameworks have also been adapted to meet with new challenges. It is likely that further changes will occur as central banks seek to combine their financial stability objectives with the monetary policy objectives.
