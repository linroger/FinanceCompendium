## Announcement

This class meeting will be recorded and made available to students asynchronously.

## Lecture 2

Econ 100C: Intermediate Microeconomics Fall 2021

# ECONnected

Informal conversations with Econ PhD students about grad school.

What would inspire someone to pursue Economics Graduate School? What is PhD life like? Do your TAs/professors draw supply and demand curves, make mad money on the stock market, or re-cache the infamous Hayek/Keynes debates all day?

ECONnected connects you with an Econ PhD student to discuss these questions!

Whether you know graduate school is for you, and you want to talk about the best strategy for your application process, or you're only starting to consider graduate school and just want to learn more, we are here to get you the information you need.

If you are interested in speaking with a current economics PhD student, please fill out this google form: https://forms.gle/KUDbuM2nFCAtpk6T9.

Questions? Email us at econnected-g@ucsd.edu.

I get nervous when other people don't wear masks, especially indoors  
I'm not particularly worried, but I understand that others are and I don't mind complying with the rules.  
I'm tired of wearing a mask and sometimes just don't want to. (please…  
No preference  
I limit my time indoors with other people to as close to zero as I can get. Outside…

## In Econ 100A and B we assumed perfectly competitive markets

We made many assumptions:

- Many buyers and sellers, each very small  
- Firms all have access to the same technology and inputs, at the same prices  
- Products are identical across firms  
- Everyone knows everything, can buy from or sell to anyone at no cost

# This includes knowledge about the future

- Production and consumption have no effects on parties other than those trading  
- Perfectly rational, utility-maximizing agents

In 100C we will relax some of these assumptions.

From last time:

# Out-of-equilibrium states and price-equilibrating mechanisms

Equilibrium must be at price  $P^{*}$ , where  $Q^{D}(P^{*}) = Q^{S}(P^{*}) = Q^{*}$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/d81008b77e41cb763d7ae9628a30ed1a2be8607f90c68ec66336d8bcafacef7d.jpg)  
If  $\mathsf{P} < \mathsf{P}^{*}$ :  $Q^{D}(P) > Q^{S}(P)$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/9f0b56769cb4c50df6eeb8292b76c77d249d2b0e9de2c6fc62fc5edef17ccf14.jpg)  
If  $\mathsf{P} > \mathsf{P}^{*}$ :  $Q^{D}(P) < Q^{S}(P)$ .

there is a shortage

$\Rightarrow \mathsf{P}^{\uparrow}$  due to competition among buyers

there is excess supply

$\Rightarrow \mathsf{P} \downarrow$ due to competition among sellers

## Market Equilibrium, second interpretation

- A market is in equilibrium if no additional opportunities for mutually-beneficial exchange remain for individual buyers and sellers in the market.

Claim: In a market equilibrium a quantity  $Q^{*}$  must be sold, so that

$$
P^{D} (Q^{*}) = P^{S} (Q^{*}) = P^{*}
$$

In a competitive market:  $MB(Q^{*}) = MC(Q^{*}) = P^{*}$

Proof?

# Out-of-equilibrium states and quantity-equilibrating mechanisms

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/4627076f47b6627287b14757524245d9665eac23e0bc99d3a8fc0868313abca5.jpg)  
combined gains from next transaction

If  $Q < Q^{*}$ ,  $P^{D}(Q) > P^{S}(Q)$ .

$\Rightarrow$  there is at least one buyer willing to pay more for the next unit than its cost to the producer  $\Rightarrow Q \uparrow$

If  $Q$  is prevented from reaching  $Q^{*}$ , the potential unrealized surplus is "deadweight loss" (DWL)

# Out-of-equilibrium states and quantity-equilibrating mechanisms

$$
\mathrm{If} Q > Q^{*}, P^{D} (Q) <   P^{S} (Q)
$$

$\Rightarrow$  depending on the price, either the buyers are paying more than their reservation price, or sellers are selling at below their reservation price, or both

How can this be achieved?

Subsidies

If  $Q$  is held above  $Q^{*}$ , deadweight loss is created for every unit from  $Q^{*}$  to  $Q$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/ccf144010f9248eec450090677997baf9930217c66c9b64e994a333f03667a4d.jpg)

To sum up this and the previous slide: in a competitive market with no externalities or outside interventions, the behavior of individuals pursuing their own wellbeing will result in an outcome where total surplus is maximized – i.e. an efficient outcome.

# Consumer and producer surplus

Generally, surplus is defined as: benefits minus costs

What is the consumer's surplus from buying one unit? (CS)  
What is the producer's surplus from selling one unit? (PS)  

- What is the combined surplus from the sale of one unit? (Marginal benefit) minus (marginal cost)  $(CS + PS)$

Find surpluses (CS, PS, CS+PS) when in the market equilibrium (Q* units are sold, at price P*)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/365f7a72026d5f28b0104a75fcd0a394202e7f90d3546e6ce3c0e5dc94c1fe89.jpg)

What are PS and CS for the first unit? What about the second?

What about the last small fraction of unit number  $Q^{*}$ ?

Consumer surplus (CS) is the area under the consumers' marginal benefit curve and above the price, for the quantity traded.

Producer surplus (PS) is the area under the price and above the marginal cost of production, for the quantity traded.

Find surpluses (CS, PS, CS+PS) when in the market equilibrium (Q* units are sold, at price P*)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/a990477736a4ed75d44ee255197d7d7f442203c9aefd2b944438cf88357fcc6a.jpg)

What are PS and CS for the first unit? What about the second? What about the last small fraction of unit number  $Q^{*}$ ?

Consumer surplus (CS) is the area under the consumers' marginal benefit curve and above the price, for the quantity traded.

Producer surplus (PS) is the area under the price and above the marginal cost of production, for the quantity traded.

Total surplus (TS) is the area under marginal benefit and above marginal cost, up to the quantity traded.

If there are external costs or benefits, TS is measured relative to SMB and SMC (society-level benefits and costs)

# Surpluses in a market with price controls

Find CS, PS, and CS+PS for all units sold, in these two cases:

Price floor at  $P_{1} > P^{*}$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/2dbc8f5edf1ffe09d08a1a53695d4a1076bac0fd50e407f87eed44d09d972add.jpg)

Price ceiling at  $P_{2}< P^{*}$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/e1d5b3950018e8cb3cf5b64a620abc9238a3d6e669d089a60728db9c56e0ef51.jpg)

Conclusions

- Total surplus depends on… only the total quantity sold.  
- Price determines… how that surplus is split between producers and consumers.  
- When price is prevented from reaching  $P^*, \dots Q < Q^*$  so  $DWL > 0$

# Recap: elasticities

- Demand and supply price elasticities:

$$
\varepsilon_{x, P_{x}}^{D} = \frac{\partial x^{D}}{\partial P_{x}} \times \frac{P_{x}}{x^{D}}
$$

$$
\varepsilon_{\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {P}_{\boldsymbol {x}}}^{s} = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol {x}^{s}}{\partial \boldsymbol {P}_{\boldsymbol {x}}} \times \frac{\boldsymbol {P}_{\boldsymbol {x}}}{\boldsymbol {x}^{s}}
$$

# The two functions of price

to different consumers

- Price adjustments led to the optimal allocation of goods and services within markets.
This is the rationing function of price  
- Price adjustments also lead to the optimal allocation of resources across markets
This is the allocative function of price (inputs)

Both are manifestations of the "invisible hand": by pursuing their own self-interest, market participants are guided, as if by an invisible hand, to maximize society-level surplus. in response to prices,

# Functions of price

Benefits of a price increase:

In the short run:

Allocative role  $\longrightarrow$  increases quantity supplied (move up along short run supply curve)  
Rationing role  $\longrightarrow$  + decreases quantity demanded, thus ensuring that the good goes to consumers who value it the most  
In the long run: Allocative role Encourages firm entry, which then increases quantity supplied and decreases price

# Rationing and allocative roles vs. elasticity

Consider a positive shock to demand in food and housing. Which is likely to have less elastic supply?

a shortage is created,  $\rightarrow P \uparrow$  to new equilibrium.

Housing supply is inelastic  $\rightarrow$  when price increases, the quantity supplied only increases slightly

## Free price adjustments and efficiency

- With free entry, allowing price to jump in response to a demand increase ensures larger supply in the long run.  
- Problems with this model?
- Can't firms anticipate that their profits will quickly be eroded away?  
- Might incumbent firms use their windfall profits to prevent new firm entry?  
- What if this is a transitory demand shock?

Solution to the problem of essential but sporadically-needed goods?

E.g….

## Overproduction

- In class we went over the following scenario: the produced quantity in a given period is higher than intended (e.g. bumper crops in agriculture). Then price would be driven down by the excess quantity available for sale.  
- If there is a price floor which prevents the good from being sold below some level, some quantity will go unsold, and – assuming it isn't put to some other use – the full area under demand for the segment of quantity from  $Q^{*}$  to  $Q^{\prime}$  (produced but not consumed) would be DWL.  
- If the gov't were to agree to buy the excess output from producers at that price, the purchase itself would neither increase nor decrease DWL, since all that is happening is a transfer.
- But, the way in which this purchase is potentially relevant for DWL is if the government announces ahead of time that it will support that price level with public purchases, regardless of what excess quantity is available. See next slide.

## A separate (but related) case:

## Price supports with guaranteed gov't purchase

(We didn't show this case during lecture)

- What if the government guaranteed that they would always purchase any excess quantity available for sale at some agreed-upon price?  
(This is a different type of price constraint than what we have been discussing. In fact, there is no longer a need for a formal price floor, since producers wouldn't want to sell for a lower price anyway.)  
- Then there would be intentional over-production, and deadweight loss would be the full area under the supply curve, for the range of quantities from  $Q^{*}$  to  $Q^{\prime}$ , PLUS the full area under the demand curve from the quantity  $Q^{\prime \prime}$  consumers buy to  $Q^{*}$ .

Econ 100C

## Taxes on goods and services

## (General) sales tax

- is a tax imposed on all commodities (with exceptions) at the point of sale  
- it specifies a dollar amount per dollar (ad valorem) that has to be collected at the point of sale.

e.g. the sales tax in San Diego is:  $7.75\%$  ( $= 7.25\%$  state +  $0.5\%$  SD county +  $0\%$  SD)

- Collects money for federal, state, local gov't  
Generally recognized as a distortionary intervention

## - Excise tax (or specific tax)

- is imposed on a specific commodity (e.g. cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline)  
- it usually specifies a dollar amount per unit that has to be collected at the point of sale.
- e.g. excise tax per pack of cigarettes in Chicago is \$8.17 !!!

city tax (\$1.18) plus Cook County (\$3.00) plus Illinois (\$2.98) + federal (\$1.01)

Intended to:

- raise money for provision of specific public goods  
discourage consumption

## Excise taxes – graphical representation

We will focus on excise taxes. The methods and conclusions of the analysis of sales taxes are similar.

Usually, the seller is responsible for collecting the tax. For every unit sold, the seller has to pay tax  $t$  to the government  

- Suppose the seller is willing to supply  $Q_{0} = Q^{S}(P)$  at price  $P$  
- Then an excise tax  $t$  is imposed.
  - At what price will the seller now supply the same quantity  $Q_0$ ?  
What happens to the supply curve?

## Excise taxes – graphical representation

It's as if the seller has a new supply function  $S'$ :

$S^{\prime}$  is  $S$  shifted up by tax  $t$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/4db2961523a996d8e8a49bd0b3975e87c36181fb73ec431bc6a7659d23bbb95c.jpg)

## Excise taxes – interpretation

- Recall technology and costs determine a firm's supply curve  
- We can think of an excise tax as an extra marginal cost per unit.

Then the profit maximizing condition is:  $MC(q) + t = P$

$\Rightarrow MC = P - t,$  from which we obtain the firm's supply:

$$
q^{s^{\prime}} (P) = q^{s} (P - t)
$$

$\Rightarrow$  At the market level:  $Q^{s^{\prime}}(P) = Q^{s}(P - t)$

- Alternatively, if the tax is collected from consumers, we can think of adding it to the price they pay:

$$
q^{D^{\prime}} (P) = q^{D} (P + t)
$$

(then supply would stay unchanged)

# Excise taxes – graphical representation

If taxes are collected from sellers, this increases their costs and it looks as though the supply curve shifts up:

If taxes are collected from buyers (or we simply take the producer's perspective), it looks as though the demand curve shifts down:

# Market equilibrium with excise tax

Tax  $t$  introduces a wedge between the prices faced by the demand and supply sides ( $p^d$  and  $p^s$ ):

$$
p^{d} = p^{s} + t
$$

What happens to the quantity produced?

The good is under-produced  $Q^{\prime}< Q^{*}$

Do tax receipts capture the lost consumer and producer surplus?

No, there is deadweight loss:

DWL = a reduction in net economic benefits resulting from an inefficient allocation of resources.

# Recall: Market equilibrium with excise tax

Tax  $t$  introduces a wedge between the prices faced by the demand and supply sides ( $P^D$  and  $P^S$ )

$$
P^{D} = P^{S} + t
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/67703631761e836cf53a2157ed5408714878a44cb059c85d85c96393ec4fffd0.jpg)

$\rightarrow$  Algebraically, look for quantity  $Q'$  so that

$$
P^{D} (Q^{\prime}) = P^{S} (Q^{\prime}) + t
$$

$\rightarrow$  Graphically, we can shift supply up by  $t$

$$
Q^{D} = 6 0 - P
$$

$$
Q^{S} = 2 P
$$

$$
t = 1 2

Without tax:

$$
Q^{D} (P) = Q^{S} (P)
$$

$$
6 0 - P = 2 P
$$

$$
P^{*} = 2 0
$$

$$
Q^{*} = 4 0

With tax:

$$
Q^{D} (P^{d}) = Q^{S} (P^{S})
$$

$$

## Incidence of a tax

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/1b03c9fe547cd72fe60715d958d674498e4141017b805dd3aa2083f3170b7401.jpg)

The incidence of a tax  $=$  a measure of the effect of a tax on the prices consumers pay and sellers receive:

- The price consumers pay increases by:  $P^{D} - P^{*}$  
- The price sellers earn decreases by:  $P^{*} - P^{S}$

## Incidence of a tax

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/a482191285e9d3a86fe4e9ba3a85f51344cab1bebdda5e07aff05843db643009.jpg)

The incidence of a tax depends on the elasticity of demand and supply.

When supply is more elastic than demand, the incidence of the tax is borne primarily by consumers

## Incidence of a tax, cont'd

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/da615f4fcc2caccb816589d49ac4bdb8039b5fed7f3ab8172b7b5712e300234f.jpg)

When demand is more elastic than supply, the incidence of the tax is borne primarily by producers

In general, the side that can respond less to price (i.e. is less elastic) will bear most of the tax.

## Production quota

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/dc89bd7ad53646f584ac9416922f5fa0c1502cc2d19027d7bb26e220484232cb.jpg)

A production quota is an upper limit on how much can be produced in a market. (A limited number of firms would each be given an individual quota.)

Will price end up above or below  $P^{*}$ ?

## Firm supply decision

How does the firm decide how much to produce?

It tries to maximize  $\pi(q): q^s = \arg \max (P \times q - TC(q))$

1 $^{\text{st}}$  order condition:  $\pi'(q) = 0$

But what is  $P$ ?  $P$  is the highest price the firm can charge per unit

- For a small undifferentiated producer:  $P = P_{mkt}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow q^{s} = q \mathrm{fo rw hi ch} P_{m k t} = M C (q) \\ \Rightarrow \text{in ve rs e} P^{S} (q) = M C (q) \\ \end{array}
$$

- For a large/differentiated producer,  $P$  is given by …  
its residual demand function: (i.e. the demand for its product)  $P = P_{\text{residual}}^{D}(q)$  
- For a monopolist,  $P$  is given by … market demand:  $P = {P}_{\text{market }}^{D}\left( q\right)$

What does the supply curve (or supply function) show, again?

It shows the quantity available for sale at any given price:  $q^{S}(P)$  
$\rightarrow$  This concept does not apply to a firm that can influence price.

## Imperfectly competitive firms have market power

Market power is the firm's ability to raise its price without losing all its sales  

- Any firm facing a downward sloping demand curve
- If it increases price, it will only be able to sell less  
- If it wants to produce more, it will have to charge less

Price setter

A price setter will decide how much to produce depending on… consumer demand, market competition, and available options for differentiation.

## Forms of market competition

Assume many buyers

Monopsony = market with a single buyer (assume many sellers)

## Monopolist uniform pricing

How does the firm decide how much to produce?

$$
q^{s} = \arg \max (P \times q - T C (q))
$$

For a monopolist:  $\pi = P^{D}(Q) \times Q - TC(Q)$

$1^{\mathrm{st}}$  order condition:  $\pi'(Q) = 0$

$$
\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial Q} = \underbrace {\frac{\partial P^{D} (Q)}{\partial Q} \times Q + P^{D} (Q)}_{M R (Q)} - M C (Q) = 0
$$

If  $P^{D}(Q) = a - bQ$ :

$$
M R (Q) = (- b) \times Q + (a - b Q) = a - 2 b Q
$$

Set  $Q^M$  so that  $MR(Q^M) = MC(Q^M)$ .

Then set  $P^{M} = P^{D}(Q^{M})$

# Monopolist uniform pricing

How does the firm decide how much to produce?

$$

$$

For a monopolist:  $\pi = P^{D}(Q) \times Q - TC(Q)$

$$

$$

Set  $Q^M$  so that  $MR(Q^M) = MC(Q^M)$ .

Then set  $P^{M} = P^{D}(Q^{M})$

# $2^{\text{nd}}$  order condition?

So far we've only imposed the  $1^{\text{st}}$  order condition, which is met for both maximum and minimum points.

To ensure that we are at a maximum, the  $2^{\text{nd}}$  order condition will be:

$$
\frac{\partial^{2} \pi}{\partial Q^{2}} <   0
$$

For a competitive firm:  $\pi (q) = P_{mkt}\times q - TC(q)$

1storder condition:  $\pi^{\prime}(q) = P_{mkt} - MC(q) = 0$

$2^{\mathrm{nd}}$  order condition:  $\pi''(q) = -\frac{\partial MC(q)}{\partial q} < 0 \quad \rightarrow$  we need MC to increase

What does this mean?

In industries with large economies of scale, perfect competition is not a stable outcome, as firms with an initial size advantage will continue to grow.

# $2^{\text{nd}}$  order condition, cont'd

For a monopolist:  $\pi(Q) = P^{D}(Q) \times Q - TC(Q)$

1storder condition:  $\pi^{\prime}(Q) = MR - MC = 0$

$2^{\text{nd}}$  order condition:  $\pi''(Q) = \frac{\partial MR(Q)}{\partial Q} - \frac{\partial MC(Q)}{\partial Q} < 0$

For linear demand  $(P^{D}(Q) = a - bQ)$  we showed  $MR = a - 2bQ$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow \pi^{\prime \prime} (Q) = - 2 b - \frac{\partial M C (Q)}{\partial Q} <   0 \\ \Rightarrow \mathrm{we ca nh av ea so lu ti on ev en wh en} M C \downarrow \\ \end{array}
$$

# Inverse elasticity pricing rule

$$
\pi = T R - T C
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial q} = \frac{\partial T R}{\partial q} - \frac{\partial T C}{\partial q} = 0 \Leftrightarrow M R = M C
$$

$$
M R = \frac{\partial T R}{\partial q} = P + \frac{\partial P}{\partial q} \times q = P \left(1 - \frac{1}{| \varepsilon^{D} |}\right)
$$

$$
M R = M C \mathrm{le ad st o :} \quad \frac{(P - M C)}{P} = \frac{1}{| \varepsilon^{D} |}
$$

$$
P - M C = “ \mathrm{ma rk -u p}"
$$

$$
\frac{(P - M C)}{P} = “ \mathrm{Le rn er in de x}"
$$

# The Lerner Index and IEPR

# Examples:

- Generic brand of headphones, MC= \$20, elastic demand:  $\varepsilon_{Q,p} = -5$  What share of the price will the markup account for?

Lerner index  $= \frac{P - MC}{P} = \frac{1}{5}$  so  $20 \%$ of the final price will be markup

What price will be charged? Applying  $\frac{(P - MC)}{P} = \frac{1}{|\varepsilon^D|}$ , we get  $P = 25$

Branded headphones: suppose MC = \$20 and P = \$200.

Compute the mark-up. What share of the price does it account for?

Mark-up = P - MC = \$180, which makes up 180/200 = 90% of the price

Implied price elasticity of demand?

Applying IEPR we get:  $90\% = \left|\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{Q,P}}\right|$  so  $\varepsilon_{Q,P} = -1.1$

## Under perfect competition we had:

- A price-taking firm faces perfectly elastic demand:
- however much they sell, the price they get is still equal to the market price  
- what is marginal revenue?

$$
M R = \frac{\partial T R}{\partial q} = \frac{\partial (P_{m a r k e t} \times q)}{\partial q} = P_{m a r k e t}
$$

## Under a monopoly?

- The monopolist faces downsloping (market) demand
- the more output he sells, the less he can charge per unit

Consider demand  $Q^{D} = a - bP$

To find MR, write inverse demand:

$$
\operatorname{P} (Q) = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{Q}{b}
$$

Apply the formula for MR:

$$
\begin{array}{l} M R (Q) = \frac{\partial T R}{\partial Q} = P + Q * \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} \\ = \left(\frac{a}{b} - \frac{Q}{b}\right) + Q * \left(- \frac{1}{b}\right) \\ \Rightarrow M R (Q) = \frac{a}{b} - 2 \frac{Q}{b} \\ \end{array}
$$

At what quantity  $Q$  does marginal revenue drop to zero?  $a / 2$

Then TR is maximized at  $Q = a / 2$

How would the graph change if  $FC > 0$ ?

## Non-linear demand (and/or MC)

(Recall that  $P^{D}(q) = M B(q)$

if demand is competitive –

i.e. there are many buyers)

The same methods apply for non-linear functions  $\underline{P^D(q)}$  or  $\underline{MC(q)}$ :

Calculate  $MR = \frac{\partial TR}{\partial q} = P^{D}(q) + \frac{\partial P^{D}(q)}{\partial q} \times q$  

- Set  $MR = MC$  to find  $Q^{M}$  
- Set  $P^{M} = P^{D}(Q^{M})$

[I use  $q$  and  $Q$  interchangeably, except when we are contrasting firmvs market-level quantities, in which case  $q$  is the firm quantity and  $Q$  is the market quantity.]

To find consumer surplus, note that it simply represents the sum of unit-level surplus amounts  $(MB_{i} - P)$ , for all the units  $i$  consumed. In the continuous case this becomes an integral:

$$
C S = \sum_{i} (M B_{i} - P) \rightarrow \int_{0}^{Q^{M}} (M B (x) - P) d x
$$

Similarly:  $P S = \int_{ 0 }^{ Q^{ M } } ( P - M C ( x ) ) d x$

Deadweight loss:  $DWL = \int_{Q^M}^{Q^*}(MB(x) - MC(x))dx$  (assuming no externalities)

In IMVH video G1.h, surplus is calculated by integrating regular demand  $Q(p)$  over the relevant range of price. This method also works, in that it will yield the same numerical value, but I think it is less intuitive.

Numerical example: demand:  $Q^{D} = 20 - 4P$  marginal cost: MC=1

Find the monopolist's profit-maximizing quantity and price.

Find PS, CS, DWL.

Inverse demand is:

$$
P^{D} = 5 - Q / 4
$$

The monopolist's marginal revenue is then:

$$
\mathrm{MR} = 5 - \mathrm{Q} / 2
$$

Set MR = MC

$5 - Q / 2 = 1$ , which leads to:

$$
Q^{M} = 8
$$

$$
P^{M} = 5 - 8 / 4 = \$ 3
$$

$$
P S = (3 - 1)^{*} 8 = \$ 1 6
$$

$$
C S = (5 - 3)^{*} 8 / 2 = \$ 8
$$

$$
D W L = (3 - 1)^{*} (1 6 - 8) / 2 = \$ 8
$$

Does this monopolist earn positive profits?

$$
\pi = P S - F C
$$

What if marginal cost MC increases linearly?

Again, PS and profit are maximized when MR=MC

What if marginal cost MC decreases linearly?

Unlike for a price-taking firm, we can have a solution at MR=MC even with MC decreasing, as long as MR decreases faster than MC.

$$
\mathrm{Ne ed} \frac{\partial^{2} \pi}{\partial Q^{2}} <   0
$$

$$
\Leftrightarrow \frac{\partial}{\partial Q} (M R - M C) <   0
$$

Remember for price taker,

$$
M R = P_{m a r k e t} \Rightarrow \frac{\partial M R}{\partial q} = 0
$$

So  $2^{\text{nd}}$  order cond. was  $\frac{\partial MC}{\partial q} > 0$

## Minimum efficient scale (MES)

= the smallest quantity at which the long run average cost curve attains its minimum point

(Assuming AC remains roughly constant over some range of quantity – otherwise MES is simply the quantity where AC is minimized)

# Monopoly

What is a monopoly? a market with a single seller

- A monopsony? a market with a single buyer

In what contexts do find monopolies?

- Natural monopolies
- Very large economies of scale (large initial fixed costs, minimum efficient scale may be close to the size of the market)

Examples? utilities, toll roads

- Large network economies (as more people use them, they become more valuable to consumers)
- Legally-granted monopolies = patents, copyright
- A company is given exclusive right to a technology

Examples? Pharmaceuticals, books

- Anti-competitive activities
- Cartel = a group of firms cooperate to set prices/quantities jointly.  
Large incumbent firm deters entrants through predatory pricing, other tactics

P ($/unit)

When we discussed monopoly pricing, we assumed uniform pricing: a unique price for all consumers in the market.

Recall the steps to find  $Q^M$  and  $P^M$

Is this outcome efficient?

# Optimal monopoly pricing?

P (\$/unit)

How can the monopolist extract more PS?

- set a higher price for consumers with high willingness to pay (WTP)  
- set a lower price for buyers with low WTP.

Ideally, the monopolist would charge each buyer exactly the maximum he is willing to pay.

Would the outcome be efficient?

Yes (DWL=0)

Would there be consumer surplus?

No (CS=0)

What is the marginal revenue function?

MR is now along demand.

# Three types of price discrimination

Setting two or more different prices for the same good or service is called price discrimination.

- First-degree (or perfect) price discrimination

– Setting prices to each consumer at exactly his willingness to pay

Examples?  

- Problems?

Second-degree PD (quantity discounts)

- Set different prices depending on quantity bought, membership discounts, etc.

Third-degree PD (segment pricing)

- Setting different prices for different consumer groups, e.g. student discounts.

# Conditions for price discrimination

- The firm needs to have market power
- i.e. be able to charge above the perfectly competitive price without losing all their customers

In addition, the firm has to be able to:

- identify consumers' willingness to pay (WTP)  
- charge different prices  
- prevent resale

# Second-degree price discrimination

The firm can extract more surplus by setting a quantity-dependent price structure. Examples:

Bulk discounts = charging a lower price per unit for a higher quantity bought.

Two-part tariffs = charge an entry/membership fee to have access to the market, then a per-unit fee.

What is the optimal strategy in this case?

# Two-part tariff optimal strategy

(at the individual consumer level)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/23042acd1d5057c921752e153edbbd8cba717a65bb764ccd27eacb920e686f75.jpg)  
P (\$/unit)

Since the firm can extract the full consumer surplus with an entrance fee, it is optimal to set per-unit price  $P = MC$  and eliminate deadweight loss.

# Second-degree price discrimination

The firm can extract more surplus by setting a quantity-dependent price structure. Examples:

Bulk discounts = charging a lower price per unit for a higher quantity bought.

Two-part tariffs = charge an entry/membership fee to have access to the market, then a per-unit fee.

What is the optimal strategy in this case?

- set the per-unit fee at marginal cost (maximize CS+PS)  
- then the membership fee = individual's consumer surplus

# Two-part tariff example

- Suppose 50 tourists go to Six Flags Magic Mountain, and for each the demand for roller-coaster rides is  $q^{D} = 10 - P$ , so that total demand is  $Q^{D} = 500 - 50P$ .  
- The marginal cost of offering a ride is \(MC = \\) 2\(  
What is the monopolist's surplus with uniform pricing?

P (\$/unit)

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q^{D} = 5 0 0 - 5 0 P \\ \Rightarrow P^{D} = 1 0 - Q / 5 0 \\ M R = \frac{\partial P Q}{\partial Q} = 1 0 - Q / 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{MR} = \mathrm{MC}, \mathrm{th er ef or e} 1 0 - \mathrm{Q} / 2 5 = 2 \\ \Rightarrow Q^{M} = 8^{*} 2 5 = 2 0 0 \\ P^{M} = 1 0 - Q^{M} / 5 0 = \$ 6 \\ P S = (6 - 2)^{*} 2 0 0 = \$ 8 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Two-part tariff example, cont'd

- Again, \(q^{D} = 10 - P, n = 50, Q^{D} = 500 - 50P, M C = \\(2.\)  
What is producer surplus with two-part tariff pricing?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/fabef08d4566c203dd3d5a35bff77ae5f87d580a8df99ad06d05de6bf61f106f.jpg)  
P (\$/unit)

Now we look at the individual consumer level. The monopolist sets price so that  $P = MC$

$$
P = \$ 2, s o q = 1 0 - 2 = 8
$$

Would-be consumer surplus is  $(10 - 2)^{*}8 / 2 = 32$

And it is extracted as a fee:  $f = \S 32$

$$
P S = 5 0 \times [ (2 - 2) \times 8 + 3 2 ] = \$ 1, 6 0 0
$$

# Third-degree price discrimination

- Charge different prices to different categories of customers (i.e. different market segments)

Examples?

- Student, senior citizen, children discounts  
- Prices that vary by location:
- More expensive gas right off the freeway  
- Cheaper round-trip international tickets if you leave from the lower income country
- Online prices – variation by OS (Mac > PC), browser, location, type of device, etc.
- Amusement parks discounts for locals

= charge tourists more

# Third-degree PD, cont'd

- When explicit price discrimination is difficult, the firm can offer different quality and price tiers so consumers will self-select into buying different versions of the product. E.g.:
- Through coupons, firms set a lower price for consumers who are pricesensitive, or have a lower opportunity cost of time.  
- Podcasts offering a no-ad version and other perks to Patreon contributors.
- In some cases, a firm can intentionally lower the quality of a good in order to make it unappealing to high-WTP customers = "damaged goods" strategy
- E.g. IBM's LaserPrinter: E version was designed to be slower.

# Roadmap

Today:

- Monopoly price discrimination  
- Monopsony

# A monopoly maximizes total producer surplus

Recall that we remarked how producers earn higher (combined) surplus if price is above the competitive equilibrium level  $P^{*}$ . The reason price doesn't stay above  $P^{*}$  is that each producer seeks to maximize only their individual surplus: they are each willing to sell for a slightly lower price if this benefits them, even though this lowers the price at which everyone else can sell, too, and total PS  $\downarrow$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/9c3ff5702f6f356404faeb8ab519dbf52936ed84628c2154fccd1c20a874164b.jpg)

This process of falling price can be prevented by:

- a price floor at  $P_{1} > P^{*}$

or, if the interests of the sellers are aligned:

- collusion among sellers (cartel)  
- single seller (monopoly)

# A monopsony maximizes total consumer surplus

Similarly, CS is maximized at some price below  $P^{*}$ . Buyers outbid each other because they are concerned only with their own surplus, even though this means everyone else has to pay more for the good and total CS  $\downarrow$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/a7d3f91cf820602ec850ad22aa57b198c4960662dceb18e67b90e751c09819dc.jpg)

This process of rising price can be prevented by:

- a price ceiling at  $P_{2}< P^{*}$ , or:  
- collusion among buyers (buyers' cartel, or buyers' group)  
- single buyer (monopsony)

Monopsonist

Find marginal revenue:

$$
M R (Q) = \frac{\partial [ P^{D} (Q) \times Q ]}{\partial Q}
$$

- Set  $MR(Q) = MC(Q)$

$\rightarrow$  solve for  $Q^{M}$

Find  $P^{M} = P^{D}(Q^{M})$

- Find marginal expenditure:

$$
M E (Q) = \frac{\partial \left[ P^{S} (Q) \times Q \right]}{\partial Q}
$$

- Set  $MB(Q) = ME(Q)$

$\rightarrow$  solve for  $Q^{m}$

Find  $P^{m} = P^{S}(Q^{m})$

# Monopsony example

Consider a monopsonist facing inverse supply  $P^{S}(Q) = MC(Q) = 2 + 3Q$  The monopsonist's marginal benefit from the good is  $MB(Q) = 20 - 2Q$

Buyer's expenditure:  $E(Q) = P^{S}(Q)\times Q = (2 + 3Q)\times Q$

Marginal expenditure:  $ME(Q) = \frac{\partial E(Q)}{\partial Q} = (2 + 3Q) + 3 \times Q = 2 + 6Q$

Optimization condition:  $MB(Q) = ME(Q)$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 0 - 2 Q = 2 + 6 Q \\ \Rightarrow Q^{m} = \frac{1 8}{8} = 2. 2 5 \\ P^{m} = P^{S} (2. 2 5) = 8. 7 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

The efficient outcome:  $MB(Q) = MC(Q)$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 0 - 2 Q = 2 + 3 Q \\ \Rightarrow Q^{*} = \frac{1 8}{5} = 3. 6 \\ P^{*} = P^{S} (3. 6) = 1 2. 8 \\ \end{array}

# Other games

- Not all games fit neatly within one of the categories we discussed

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/5eba8ca0c0bb7e5c566f4a8dd85921574ed923d2e81935bb9659cd806cc1aab6.jpg)

This game is similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma in that there is an outcome where both players are better off, but which is not reached b/c of individual incentives (Denise has the dominant strategy to watch TV)

Unlike in Prisoner's Dilemma, one of the players does not have a dominant strategy, so there is a sequential game where they can achieve the superior outcome: if the player who can't credibly promise to cooperate in the future is given the chance to cooperate first (in this case, if Denise can do her homework before Mac takes her to Brickland)

# Non-credible promises

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/aaeee5d6a6d7e84d9969c4cc329c4a7641c246a38745191fa80ec3fa5875785c.jpg)

- Denise may promise she will do her homework, but should Mac trust her?

No (not unless the payoffs are different than represented here)

# Sequential games to the rescue:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/8c1b94cb9166157a41b2fe315ce24d065a09a38ff7c2fdbdfbcf4514d9245a38.jpg)

- When structured in a way that aligns incentives with promises or threats, sequential games can achieve preferred outcomes that can't be reached in static games.  
- Can we achieve cooperation in the Prisoners' Dilemma game with the right sequence? No, because both players have a dominant strategy – so they will choose "confess" regardless of what they know about the other player.

# Static vs dynamic games

- We've talked about static games:  
= single interaction with simultaneous decisions

- There are also dynamic games:
- Repeated games:  
= finite or infinite iterations of a static game  
- Or, sequential games:  
= games played only once, but some players have information about the action of other player(s)

# Repeated games

- Cooperation can be reached in repeated games if the incentives are structured appropriately.
- Why do criminals in a "prisoners' dilemma" often not cheat?
- Different strategies to achieve cooperation. Examples:
- "Grim trigger" – as soon as one player diverges, cooperation breaks down forever  
- "Tit-for-tat" - you match what the other player last did  
- There are more sophisticated ways to set up incentives. An effective punishment contingency has to be:
- Sufficiently harsh to dissuade cheating  
- Credible – it can't hurt the punishers too much
- Can large firms in an industry expect to interact repeatedly?

# Sequential games

- Players make their decisions in a prescribed order

At each stage, players observe outcomes at earlier stages  

- Easiest to represent with the extensive form or game tree  
- Can also be represented in normal form

# Extensive form representation

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/d68ec1a29a40a2ce9094e1f7aefb1c34b8b40f5d3191eb881e28362e2053f05e.jpg)

# Contingent strategies

- Strategies are complete contingent plans  
- Since the entrant moves first, its strategies are of the same style as in simultaneous move games

$$
\triangleright S_{E} = (\text{En te r}) \text{or} (\text{No te nt er})
$$

- The incumbent needs to use contingent strategies

Each contingent strategy chooses an action based on anything that could be observed by the entrant

> One possible strategy is "if Enter then Cut, if Not Enter then Maintain", shorthand for this is (C, M)

$$
\triangleright S_{1} = (M, M), (M, C), (C, M) \text{or} (C, C)
$$

# Normal Form Representation

- Since a strategy is a complete contingent plan, players' strategies fully determine the course of play  
- We can use the tools we developed for static games to determine which strategy choices are equilibria

$\succ$  Represent the game in normal form  
Find the Nash equilibria

# Normal form representation

<table><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2"></td><td colspan="4">Incumbent</td></tr><tr><td>(M, M)</td><td>(M, C)</td><td>(C, M)</td><td>(C, C)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Entrant</td><td>Enter</td><td>4, 6</td><td>4, 6</td><td>-4, 4</td><td>-4, 4</td></tr><tr><td>Not enter</td><td>0, 12</td><td>0, 9</td><td>0, 12</td><td>0, 9</td></tr></table>

(Don't worry, we will rarely use normal form in sequential games)

The Nash equilibria are:

Enter, (M, M); Enter, (M, C); Not enter, (C, M)

Maintain price

# Non-credible threats

- Nash equilibria in dynamic games may not be plausible since they may involve "non-credible threats"
- A player can act against her best interests at some node that is never reached since the suboptimal decision does not hurt her  
- Threats are credible only if they involve a best response by the party that exercises the threat

# Subgame Perfection

- To rule out threats that are not credible, subgame perfection requires that equilibrium strategies be best-responses at every point in time.  
- A strategy profile is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium if it is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the extensive-form game.

A subgame has to include all nodes that follow from a given node.

Subgames that aren't the entire game are "proper" subgames.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/6b02293c6f60dcc9622fc469ac1f410a7a03ee59357e3a0fd57763ce08c3b1bb.jpg)

# Finding Subgame Perfect NEs

# - The hard way

Find all the Nash equilibria  
For each Nash equilibrium and each subgame, check whether that Nash equilibrium is also a Nash equilibrium in all subgames

# - The easy way: backward induction

> Start with the last stage and determine the player's best-response for each node  
> Keep going backwards, step by step  
The outcome will be a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium because players choose best responses at all stages of the game

# Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium

# Duopoly competition

- We've already seen games that simulated market interactions, with payoffs already filled in.  
- If we are specific about the nature of the market and the mode of competition, we can build the game ourselves.
- We will assume the good is homogeneous, and that demand and marginal cost are linear and known.  
E.g. duopoly in the lemonade market (Annie and Billy)

$$
P^{D} (Q) = 7 - \frac{Q}{1 0}, M C_{1} = M C_{2} = c = 1
$$

We can think of Annie and Billy as deciding prices, or quantities

# Roadmap

# Game theory and oligopoly:

# So far:

Static games  

- Sequential games, commitment problems (non-credible promises/claims)

# Today:

- Oligopoly models: static (Cournot & Bertrand) & sequential (Stackelberg)

# Next week:

- Continue oligopoly models  
- Cartel model  
- Repeated games; maintaining cartels and preventing market entry  
(brief discussion of) mixed strategy equilibria

# Oligopoly models

- "A few" (n) firms, number limited by barriers to entry  
- 2 firms: duopoly  
A firm's actions affect other firms & their optimal actions  $\rightarrow$  strategic interactions  
Type of competition:

- Homogeneous/ standardized vs. heterogenous product  
- Timing: simultaneous or sequential; one-time or repeated interactions  
Quantityor price-based

Quantity-based competition: Each firm  $i$  produces quantity  $q_{i}$

$$
P = P^{D} (Q) = P^{D} (q_{1} + q_{2} + \dots + q_{n})
$$

Price-based competition: Each firm  $i$  sets price  $p_i$

$$
P = \min (p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots)
$$

# Duopoly competition

2-firm models, can be extended to  $>2$  

- Simplifying assumptions:
- We will assume the good is homogeneous, and (usually) that demand and marginal cost are linear and known.

If there is a limited number of potential actions (discrete choices), we can use normal form (payoff matrix) or the extensive form (game tree) to represent the game, and to find best responses & equilibria.  
II. More generally, we can use algebraic/calculus-based analysis to find reaction functions.

# 1. Duopoly competition – discrete choices

E.g. duopoly in the lemonade market (Annie and Billy)

$$
P^{D} (Q) = 7 - \frac{Q}{1 0}, \qquad M C_{1} = M C_{2} = c = 1
$$

$$

# Duopoly example, quantity-based

- But suppose Annie and Billy can pick any price and produce any quantity  
- Let's say Annie produces quantity  $q_{1}$ . How can Billy maximize profits?

Billy's profits depend on how much he produces  $(q_{2})$  and how much he can charge per unit  $(P^{D}(q_{1} + q_{2}))$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \pi_{2} = P^{D} (q_{1} + q_{2}) \times q_{2} - T C_{2} (q_{2}) \\ \pi_{2} = \left(7 - \frac{(q_{1} + q_{2})}{1 0}\right) \times q_{2} - q_{2} \quad (\mathrm{si nc e} M C_{2} = 1) \\ \end{array}
$$

$1^{\mathrm{st}}$  order condition:  $\frac{\partial \pi_2}{\partial q_2} = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow \left(7 - \frac{(q_{1} + q_{2})}{1 0}\right) + \left(- \frac{1}{1 0}\right) \times q_{2} = 1 \\ 7 - \frac{q_{1}}{1 0} - 2 \frac{q_{2}}{1 0} = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow q_{2} = 3 0 - \frac{q_{1}}{2} = \text{Bi ll y 's "r ea ct io nf un ct io n "} q_{2} (q_{1}), \text{wh ic hs ho ws us Bi ll y 's}
$$

# Duopoly example, quantity-based cont'd

Is there a unique Nash Equilibrium?

Through the same analysis, we can find Annie's reaction function:

$$
q_{1} = 3 0 - \frac{q_{2}}{2}
$$

We now have enough information to solve for the equilibrium: the  $(q_{1}, q_{2})$  strategy profile where both players are best-responding:

$$
\begin{array}{l} q_{2} = 3 0 - \frac{q_{1}}{2} = 3 0 - \frac{\left(3 0 - \frac{q_{2}}{2}\right)}{2} \\ \Rightarrow q_{1} = q_{2} = 2 0 \\ Q = 4 0, P = 7 - \frac{4 0}{1 0} = \$ 3 \\ \pi_{1} = \pi_{2} = (3 - 1) \times 2 0 = \$ 4 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

This is the Cournot oligopoly model

# Duopoly example, quantity-based, sequential (Stackelberg model)

- What if Annie decides first how much to produce, then Billy sees what she decided and then makes his own decision?

The second mover's (Billy's) problem is the same, except that he is reacting to the actual quantity produced by Annie, rather than what he expected her to do.

But now the first mover (Annie) knows that Billy will react to her actions, so in her optimization problem she no longer treats Billy's production as exogenous. Instead, she factors in his reaction function:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \pi_{1} = \left(7 - \frac{\left(q_{1} + q_{2} \left(q_{1}\right)\right)}{1 0}\right) \times q_{1} - q_{1} \quad \text{wh er e} q_{2} \left(q_{1}\right) = 3 0 - \frac{q_{1}}{2} \\ \Rightarrow \pi_{1} = \left(7 - \frac{\left(3 0 + \frac{q_{1}}{2}\right)}{1 0}\right) \times q_{1} - q_{1} = \left(4 - \frac{q_{1}}{2 0}\right) \times q_{1} - q_{1} \\ 1^{\mathrm{st}} \text{or de r} 4 - \frac{q_{1}}{2 0} + \left(- \frac{1}{2 0}\right) q_{1} - 1 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow q_{1} = 3 0; q_{2} = 3 0 - \frac{3 0}{2} = 1 5; Q = 4 5, P = \$ 3. 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Annie produces much more than she would in the simultaneous game, because she knows that Billy will produce less as a result

# Oligopoly competition, quantity-based

(beyond Annie & Billy)

Suppose there are n firms, producing  $q_{1}, q_{2}, \ldots, q_{n}$  at cost  $TC_{1}, TC_{2}, \ldots, TC_{n}$ .  
Write the expression for firm  $i$ 's profit.  

- How does firm  $i$  maximize  $\pi_{i}$ ? Does timing matter?  
- Simplifying assumptions:  $P^{D}(Q) = a - bQ$ ,  $MC_{i}(q_{i}) = c$  
- Initially: 2 firms

$$
\Rightarrow \pi_{1} = \left(a - b (q_{1} + q_{2})\right) \times q_{1} - c \times q_{1}
$$

The first order optimization condition  $\left(\frac{\partial\pi_1}{\partial q_1} = 0\right)$  leads to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(a - b \left(q_{1} + q_{2}\right)\right) - b q_{1} - c = 0 \\ a - 2 b q_{1} - b q_{2} - c = 0 \Rightarrow q_{1} = \frac{(a - c)}{2 b} - \frac{q_{2}}{2} \\ \end{array}
$$

We assumed  $q_{2}$  is independent of  $q_{1}$ :  $\frac{\partial q_{2}}{\partial q_{1}} = 0$

It's as if firm 1 is a monopolist in a smaller market (see next slide).

# DowDupont and Bayer (more about mergers in this industry)

Firm 1

Firm 2

We can think of Firm 1 as being a monopoly within the residual market, after firm 2's product has been made available:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/bf15f36af56e39d4fd8d882c2f2367962a515824ee411787cda100c621f91a1a.jpg)

$$
P^{D} (Q) = (a - b q_{2}) - b Q
$$

# Cournot Duopoly – Nash equilibrium

Just as we found firm 1's reaction function  $q_{1} = \frac{(a - c)}{2b} - \frac{q_{2}}{2}$  
… we can find firm 2's reaction function:  $q_{2} = \frac{(a - c)}{2b} - \frac{q_{1}}{2}$

In a Nash Equilibrium both firms are best-responding to the other's actions

$\Rightarrow$  both reaction functions have to hold.

Find the resulting market outcome (Q's, P, etc.)

$$
q_{1} = q_{2} = \frac{(a - c)}{3 b}, \ldots
$$

The Cournot equilibrium lies at the intersection of the two Cournot reaction functions:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/6697640354df3aaa4dadea1520e52f2f3e69c4907de54e9f603474291a2570d5.jpg)

What if the firms have different marginal costs?

Suppose  $c_1 \neq c_2$ :

Each firm's reaction function depends on its own costs:

$$
q_{1} = \frac{(a - c_{1})}{2 b} - \frac{q_{2}}{2}, q_{2} = \frac{(a - c_{2})}{2 b} - \frac{q_{1}}{2}
$$

Solve for the equilibrium:

$$
\begin{array}{l} q_{1} = \frac{(a - c_{1})}{2 b} - \frac{\left(\frac{(a - c_{2})}{2 b} - \frac{q_{1}}{2}\right)}{2} = \frac{(a - c_{1})}{2 b} - \frac{(a - c_{2})}{4 b} + \frac{q_{1}}{4} \\ \Rightarrow q_{1} = \frac{a - 2 c_{1} + c_{2}}{3 b}, q_{2} = \frac{a - 2 c_{2} + c_{1}}{3 b}, Q = \frac{2 a - c_{1} - c_{2}}{3 b} \\ \end{array}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/731992242e9cbabfa32a19d85f36d22e4317e8e8b9e5ba7e1d680c24da9d04c7.jpg)

Suppose  $c_1 \neq c_2$ :

Each firm's reaction function depends on its own costs:

$$
q_{1} = \frac{(a - c_{1})}{2 b} - \frac{q_{2}}{2}, q_{2} = \frac{(a - c_{2})}{2 b} - \frac{q_{1}}{2}
$$

Solve for the equilibrium:

$$
\begin{array}{l} q_{1} = \frac{(a - c_{1})}{2 b} - \frac{\left(\frac{(a - c_{2})}{2 b} - \frac{q_{1}}{2}\right)}{2} = \frac{(a - c_{1})}{2 b} - \frac{(a - c_{2})}{4 b} + \frac{q_{1}}{4} \\ \Rightarrow q_{1} = \frac{a - 2 c_{1} + c_{2}}{3 b}, q_{2} = \frac{a - 2 c_{2} + c_{1}}{3 b}, Q = \frac{2 a - c_{1} - c_{2}}{3 b} \\ \end{array}
$$

What will be the effect when a firm becomes more efficient?

e.g. if  $c_1 \downarrow$ $q_1 \uparrow$  or  $\downarrow$ ?

# Game theory and oligopoly:

# Previously:

- Classic static games (prisoner's dilemma, chicken, zero-sum), finding Nash Eqbm.  
- Sequential games, Sub-game Perfect Nash Eqbm  
Quantity-based duopoly (2 firms) models: - simultaneous (Cournot) & sequential (Stackelberg)

# Today:

# Oligopoly models

- "A few" (n) firms, number limited by barriers to entry
- 2 firms: duopoly

A firm's actions affect other firms & their optimal actions  $\rightarrow$  strategic interactions  
Type of competition:

- Homogeneous/ standardized vs. heterogenous product  
- Timing: simultaneous or sequential; one-time or repeated interactions  
Quantityor price-based

Quantity-based competition: Each firm  $i$  produces quantity  $q_{i}$

$$
P = P^{D} (Q) = P^{D} (q_{1} + q_{2} + \dots + q_{n})
$$

Price-based competition: Each firm  $i$  sets price  $p_i$

$$
P = \min (p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots)
$$

# Cournot oligopoly – N firms

Suppose there are  $N$  firms and market price depends on the total quantity they

produce:  $Q = q_{1} + q_{2} + \dots +q_{N}$

For a firm  $i$ , let  $q_{-i} = Q - q_i =$  the quantity made by all other firms in the market.

Then firm  $i$  will produce quantity  $q_{i}$  that (it believes) will maximize its profit:

$$
\pi_{i} = P^{D} (q_{i} + q_{- i}) \times q_{i} - T C_{i} (q_{i})
$$

Set 1st order optimization condition for firm  $i$ :  $\frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial q_i} = 0$  & assume  $\frac{\partial q_{-i}}{\partial q_i} = 0$

$$
\Rightarrow P^{D} (q_{i} + q_{- i}) + q_{i} \times \frac{\partial P^{D}}{\partial Q} = M C_{i} (q_{i})
$$

[Recall monopoly optimization:  $P^{D}(Q) + Q \times \frac{\partial P^{D}}{\partial Q} = MC(Q)$ ]

$\Rightarrow$  we can derive  $i$ 's reaction function  $q_{i}(q_{-i})$

# Cournot oligopoly – N firms, linear demand

cont'd from last slide:  $P^{D}(q_{i} + q_{-i}) + q_{i}\times \frac{\partial P^{D}}{\partial Q} = MC_{i}(q_{i})$

Let  $P^{D}(Q) = a - bQ$ ,  $c = MC_{i}(q_{i})$

$$
\Rightarrow a - b \times (q_{i} + q_{- i}) + q_{i} \times (- b) = c
$$

$$
\Rightarrow q_{i} = \frac{(a - c)}{2 b} - \frac{q_{- i}}{2}
$$

There are  $N$  such reaction functions  $\rightarrow$  we can solve for  $N$  quantities

If firms are identical, then in equilibrium  $q_{1} = q_{2} = \dots = q_{N} \Rightarrow q_{-i} = (N - 1)q_{i}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow q_{i} = \frac{(a - c)}{2 b} - \frac{(N - 1) q_{i}}{2} \\ \Rightarrow q_{i} = \frac{1}{N + 1} \times \frac{(a - c)}{b} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Cournot oligopoly, cont'd

Find the market quantity, price and profits for N identical firms under Cournot oligopoly. (Assuming  $P^{D}(Q) = a - bQ$ ,  $c = MC_{i}(q_{i})$

$$
\begin{array}{l} q_{i} = \frac{1}{N + 1} \times \frac{(a - c)}{b} \\ \Rightarrow Q = N q_{i} = \frac{N}{N + 1} \times \frac{(a - c)}{b} \\ P = a - b Q = a - \frac{N}{N + 1} \times (a - c) = \frac{a N + a - N a + N c}{N + 1} \\ \Rightarrow P = \frac{a + N c}{N + 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

What happens when  $N \to \infty$ ?

$$
P = \frac{\frac{a}{N} + c}{1 + \frac{1}{N}} \rightarrow \frac{0 + c}{1 + 0} = c
$$

# Example 2, cont'd

For demand  $P^{D}(Q) = 7 - \frac{Q}{10}$ , and if all firms have MC=1, fill in the table:

$$
\Rightarrow P = \frac{a + N c}{N + 1} = \frac{(7 + N)}{N + 1}
$$

<table><tr><td></td><td>Monopoly (N=1)</td><td>Cournot N=2</td><td>Cournot N=3</td><td>Cournot N=5</td><td>Cournot N=10</td><td>Perfect competition</td></tr><tr><td>Market price</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2.5</td><td>2</td><td>17/11 ≈ 1.5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Market quantity</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>45</td><td>50</td><td>~55</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Market-level profit</td><td>90</td><td>80</td><td>67.5</td><td>50</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Firm-level profit</td><td>90</td><td>40</td><td>22.5</td><td>10</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr></table>

$\rightarrow$  As N becomes large, the Cournot equilibrium approaches the perfectly competitive equilibrium.

# Cartel model

- Firms coordinate their quantity decisions so as to achieve monopoly profits

$\succ$  Also known as the collusive model

- Cartel chooses  $q_{j}$  for each firm so as to maximize total industry profits

$$
\pi = P^{D} (q_{i} + q_{- i}) \times Q - [ T C_{1} (q_{1}) + T C_{2} (q_{2}) + \dots + T C_{N} ]
$$

The first-order conditions for a maximum are that  $\frac{\partial\pi}{\partial q_i} = 0,\qquad \forall i\in \{1,N\}$

$$
\Rightarrow P^{D} (Q) + Q \times \frac{\partial P^{D (Q)}}{\partial Q} = M C_{i} (q_{i})
$$

$$
M R (Q) = M C_{i} (q_{i})
$$

Unlike under oligopoly, producers in a cartel take into account combined revenues

# Cartel model, cont'd

# - Problems with the cartel solution

$\succ$  Collusion may be illegal  
There is a large informational requirement  
The outcome is unstable: Each firm has an incentive to expand output because  $MR_{i} > MC_{i}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} M R_{i} (q_{i}) = P^{D} (Q) + q_{i} \times \frac{\partial P^{D (Q)}}{\partial Q} \\ > P^{D} (Q) + Q \times \frac{\partial P^{D (Q)}}{\partial Q} = M C_{i} \\ \end{array}
$$

- This problem is much more severe under Bertrand (price-based) competition, where undercutting the cartel price leads to large gains, not just incremental ones.  
- Maintaining a cartel is the same as playing "don't confess" in the Prisoners' Dilemma: it's a dominated strategy in the static (one-shot) game, but in repeated games people find a way to cooperate…

# Bertrand (price) competition

- Again, consider the duopoly of DowDupont and Bayer.  
Now firms set price.  
- The firm with the lowest price captures the entire market:
- Assume Bayer's price is  $p_{B}$  
- Then what is DowDupont's residual demand?  
- What will be the equilibrium?

If Bayer sets price  $p_B$ , what is DowDupont's residual demand?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/a2597cdf326e65f02321755d35bcf3cc3ef6c1f5ca9c129af711ab4bf63bb033.jpg)

It is equal to market demand below  $p_B$ , and zero above  $p_B$ .

DD will capture the entire market if it sets its price just a little lower.

(if  $P_B$  is above the monopoly price, DD will maximize profits by pricing at the monopoly price:  $P_{DD} = P^M -\mathrm{otherwise}P_{DD} = P_B - \varepsilon$ )

# Bertrand reaction functions

- Suppose  $MC_{DD} = MC_B = c$ .
- For price competition, DD's reaction function would show what price DD sets in response to  $P_B$
- In words: DD sets price just below B, but no lower than c  
- Mathematically:  $P_{DD} = P_B - \varepsilon$  as long as  $P_{DD} \geq c$

(ε is the smallest feasible price difference – 1¢, sometimes less)

- The equilibrium has to be on both firms' reaction functions.  
- B's reaction function: B sets price just below DD, but no lower than c, or:  $P_{B} = P_{DD} - \varepsilon$ , as long as  $P_{B} \geq c$  
What is equilibrium price? At marginal cost  $c$ .

# Cournot vs. Bertrand equilibria

Again, consider the inverse demand function  $P = 7 - Q / 10$  

- All firms have constant and equal marginal cost  $MC = 1$  Graph the Cournot and Bertrand equilibrium prices vs. N

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/4f2320ff22da309711d27f0e213afda85e4dd9c73ee13271ead5a97d638ab8f4.jpg)

# Bertrand equilibrium

- We found that even with just two firms, the Bertrand equilibrium is the same as the competitive market equilibrium: prices are set equal to marginal cost.

$$
P_{D D} = P_{B} = c
$$

What did we assume?

1. Firms compete on the basis of price, and consumers switch easily in response to small price differences  
2. Firms can supply any amount of output instantly

Is this realistic for all markets?

2 is not realistic for most physical goods, especially those produced with capital-intensive technology (e.g. if Honda underprices Toyota, they still can't sell more units than their current production capacity, which was decided years ago).

1 is not realistic for most consumer goods, where people get attached to brands, or whenever there are switching costs. (E.g. before 2004, US consumers had to get a new number when they switched cellphone providers – see FCC rules)

# Bertrand equilibrium, cont'd

What if the firms' costs are not identical?

If  $c_{1} < c_{2}$ , firm 1 will take over the entire market and set price just below  $c_{2}$

What if there are N firms, and  $c_{1} < c_{2} < \dots < c_{N}$ ?

(same as above)

# Repeated games

- Cooperation can be reached in repeated games if the incentives are structured appropriately.
- Why do criminals in a "prisoners' dilemma" often not cheat?
- Different strategies to achieve cooperation. Examples:
- "Grim trigger" – if one player diverges, cooperation breaks down forever  
- "Tit-for-tat" - you match what the other player last did
- Price match guarantees
- There are more sophisticated ways to set up incentives. An effective punishment contingency has to be:
- Sufficiently harsh to dissuade cheating  
- Credible – it can't hurt the punishers too much
- The more firms there are, the harder it is to maintain a cartel
- Can large firms in an industry expect to interact repeatedly?

# Mixed strategies

So far we've only talked about pure strategies

= a specific choice of an action

- Mixed strategies = playing two or more pure strategies with certain specified probabilities
- Each pure strategy with prob  $>0$  has to have the same expected payoff.
- All games have at least one NE – might be in mixed strategies

<table><tr><td rowspan="4">Goalie</td><td colspan="3">Kicker</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Aim left</td><td>Aim right</td></tr><tr><td>Dive to kicker&#x27;s left</td><td>0, 0</td><td>-10, 10</td></tr><tr><td>Dive to kicker&#x27;s right</td><td>-10, 10</td><td>0, 0</td></tr></table>

- If the Goalie believes the Kicker plays (L  $50\%$ , R  $50\%$ ), his expected payoff is -5 from either L or R.  
Similarly, for the kicker the expected payoff  $= 5$  from either action if the goalie randomizes (L  $50\%$ , R  $50\%$ )

What is the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium here?

Each player goes Left or Right with  $50\%$  probability.

It has to look like they are tossing a coin.

# Externalities

An externality is the effect that the action of an agent has on the well-being of other agents, beyond the effects transmitted through markets (through price changes).

Externalities can arise from consumption or production, and can be positive or negative.

# Examples:

- Negative production externalities?  
- Positive production externalities?  
- Negative consumption externalities?  
- Positive consumption externalities?

# Social marginal benefits and costs

- The social marginal benefit SMB is the benefit, summed over all agents in the economy, from the consumption of one more unit of a good.  
- Similarly, the social marginal cost SMC is the cost, summed over all agents in the economy, of producing one more unit.

For simplicity, we will be showing external benefits on the demand side and external costs on the supply side.

Social MB = (private) marginal benefit + external marginal benefit

$$
S M B = (P) M B + E M B
$$

Social MC = (private) marginal cost + external marginal cost

$$
S M C = (P) M C + E M C
$$

# Total (social) surplus TS (or SS)

- Greatest possible total surplus is the area below SMB and above SMC  
Efficient quantity is  $Q^{e}$  where:

$$
S M B (Q) = S M C (Q)
$$

(and  $SMB(Q) < SMC(Q)$  for higher Q)

# Negative externalities

With a negative externality, the social cost is greater than the private cost

A self-interested economic agent doesn't take into account the full costs of his/her actions.

Is the outcome efficient?

No: the good will be over-produced relative to the social optimum.

# Negative externalities

A self-interested economic agent doesn't take into account the full costs of his/her actions.

No: the good will be over-produced relative to the social optimum.

Note: if this was a negative externality in consumption and we wanted to incorporate it in the marginal benefit curve, the answer would be exactly the same. That's why it's okay to just look at production-related negative externalities.

# Example 1

Consider a chemical plant that operates upstream from a farm.

The plant sells its output at a constant price of 20 (thousand  $\mathcal{S} / \mathrm{ton})$  and its cost of production is  $TC = q^{2} + 30$

The farm downstream suffers an external cost  $EMC = 4$  per ton of output Solve for the private market equilibrium & the socially efficient quantity.

How might the social optimum be reached?

$$
q^{C} = ? \quad M C = \frac{\partial T C}{\partial q} = 2 q = P M C
$$

Set MC=MB:  $2q = 20 \Rightarrow q^{C} = 10$

$$
q^{e} = ? \quad S M C = P M C + E M C = 2 q + 4
$$

Set SMB=SMC:  $2q + 4 = 20 \Rightarrow q^{e} = 8$

# Example 1, cont'd

Can the plant and the farm achieve the efficient output level on their own?

What if the plant had the right to pollute as much as it wants?

On its own, it will produce  $Q = 10$ . But, the farmer will be willing to pay up to  $\$ 4$ per unit of output that the plant stops making. From  $q = 8$ to  $q = 10$ , the plant earns surplus of less than  $\$ 4$ per unit, so there is room for mutually beneficial agreements.

What if the farmer is given the right to a clean river?

It would be up to the plant to compensate the farmer for any pollution they create. Starting at  $q = 0$ , the plant will earn a surplus of  $\$ 20$ per unit of output produced, whereas the farmer will benefit as long as he receives at least  $\$ 4$ from the plant. (It’s not clear what the price will actually be.) This goes on until  $q = 8$ , since past this point the plant is no longer willing to pay  $\$ 4$ or more per unit for the right to pollute.

# Solutions to externalities

- Assign property rights

= the exclusive control over the use of an asset or resource

The Coase Theorem:

In the presence of an externality, property rights ensure an efficient allocation of resources

- regardless of how property rights are assigned  
- as long as the affected parties can bargain with each other at no cost (and have a way to enforce agreements)  
Note: the theorem is about efficiency, not fairness (that's why it doesn't matter who gets the property right)

# Example 2

How many times per month should you go to the grocery store?

Weigh benefits against costs

- Benefits are all private:  
Costs are - both private: gas/bus ticket, cost of time, risk of infection  
- and external: risk of infection to others, pollution, congestion

When an agent's activities impose costs on others that he does not pay for in some way, we say he doesn't internalize these costs.

Consider the numerical example, where  $Q = \#$  trips to store/month

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q^{D} (P) = 3 0 - P / 2 \\ M C = 2 0 + Q / 2 \\ E M C = 5 + Q \\ \end{array}
$$

# Examples, cont'd

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/7cd58d5a0952572ba9486caba686a3fe1112f04f299693daa8bbb596f52a63ca.jpg)

We derive inverse demand (MB):

$$
\mathrm{MB} = \mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{D}} = 6 0 - 2 \mathrm{Q}
$$

The privately chosen outcome is at

$$
M B = M C:
$$

$$
6 0 - 2 Q = 2 0 + Q / 2
$$

$$
\mathrm{So} \quad Q^{\mathrm{c}} = 2^{*} 4 0 / 5 = 1 6
$$

Socially efficient level is at SMB=SMC:

$$
S M B = M B = 6 0 - 2 Q
$$

$$
S M C = M C + E M C = 2 5 + 3 Q / 2
$$

Therefore:

$$
6 0 - 2 Q = 2 5 + 3 Q / 2
$$

$$
\mathrm{So} Q^{\mathrm{e}} = 2^{*} 3 5 / 7 = 1 0
$$

# Solutions, cont'd

# • Taxes (Pigouvian tax)

- Adjust the private cost to account for the external costs of production or consumption, so as to "internalize" the externality  
- Difficult politically – e.g. higher gasoline taxes

What tax would be needed to correct for the externality in the previous example?

$$
\begin{array}{l} t = \mathrm{EM Ca th ee ff ic ie nt qu at it y} \\ = \$ 15 \text{pe rt ri p} \\ \end{array}
$$

What about limiting how many times people can go to the store?

# Solutions, cont'd

- Quantity regulation: limit production/ emissions
- Drawbacks?
- Only efficient if the regulating body has full information about costs and benefits  
- Difficult to implement

# Solutions, cont'd

# - Cap-and-trade system

- cap emissions at the industry level, then assign property rights on emission allowances  
- firms trade emission permits  
- It creates a market mechanism for trading the right to pollute – imposes a price on pollution

Exercise: consider a perfectly competitive market.

1. Find the market equilibrium  $(P^{*}, Q^{*})$  and indicate producer and consumer surplus. If there are no externalities, what is the efficient level of production  $Q^{e}$ ?

$$
P^{D} = M C \Rightarrow Q^{*} = 8, P = 6
$$

No externalities:

$\Rightarrow$  SMC=SMB at the same point as

$$
\mathrm{MC} = \mathrm{MB} \Rightarrow Q^{e} = Q^{*}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} C S = \frac{(1 4 - 6) * 8}{2} = \$ 3 2 \\ P S = \frac{(6 - 2) * 8}{2} = \$ 1 6 \\ \Rightarrow T S = C S + P S = \$ 4 8 \\ \end{array}

# Positive externalities

- With a positive externality, the marginal social benefit is greater than the marginal private benefit:

$$
S M B = P M B + E M B
$$

The good will be under-produced relative to the social optimum.

Solutions:

- Subsidies - e.g. vaccinations, education, green energy practices  
- Property rights - e.g. patents  
- Mandates - e.g. childhood vaccinations, compulsory education

# The economics of the Amazon rainforest

- Social cost of carbon ≈ \$50/ton of CO2  
1 hectare of forest stores  $\approx$  560 tons CO2  
- Social cost of burning 1 hectare of forest ≈ \$28,000  
- Price of 1 hectare of rainforest = \$1,000

# The economics of the Amazon rainforest

In some cases the externalities are so extreme that they far exceed private costs & benefits:

$\mathbb{S}$ /hectare  $(\times 1,000)$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/08568f3a093760ed36ab340be06dc7a36114c5f523dc63a9bf4f6f9ae49f4cf8.jpg)

It is hugely inefficient to turn the rainforest into agricultural land.  
But who should incur the opportunity cost of preserving it?  

- The rainforest serves as a global public good by storing CO2 – we all benefit from it (as long as it's still around), whether or not we contribute to its maintenance.

# Public goods

Public goods = goods that are non-rival and non-excludable

Non-rival goods:

- The consumption of a good by one person does not reduce the quantity that can be consumed by others.

Non-excludable goods:

- A good that, once produced, is available to all consumers: no one can be excluded from consuming such a good.

# Categories of goods

- Private goods are rival and excludable

e.g. food, clothing, music CDs

"Pure" Public goods = non-rival and non-excludable

e.g. national defense

Common resources are rival but non-excludable

e.g. public parks, roads (when congested)

Club goods are non-rival but excludable

e.g. satellite radio, cable TV, Netflix, Spotify

"impure"

$$

- How should we add (house-level) demand for house plants? Suppose:

# Efficient provision of public goods

As with all goods, net benefit is maximized when:

$$
m a r g i n a l b e n e f i t = m a r g i n a l c o s t
$$

$$
S M B (Q) = \sum_{i} M B_{i} (Q) = M C (Q)
$$

Equivalently, we can write the "Samuelson condition" for the efficient provision of a public good:

$$
\sum_{i} M R S_{G, x}^{i} = M R T_{G, x} = \frac{P_{G}}{P_{x}}
$$

Recall  $MRS_{G,x} = \#$  units of good  $x$  the consumer is willing to give up for 1 unit of  $G$ .

Then  $\sum_{i} MRS_{G,x}^{i} = \#$  units of good  $x$  society is willing to give up for 1 unit of G.

$MRT_{G,x} = \#$  units of  $x$  that can be exchanged for 1 unit of  $G = \frac{P_G}{P_x}$  (marginal rate of transformation)

# Good news (potentially)

Non-rival goods can amplify value

- Hand-copying a book vs. typing it into a computer
- Does this mean individual ownership of non-rival goods wastes resources? Yes!
- Charlie and his neighbor Danny each have a 400 sq ft lawn that they mow for 20 mins once a month. Which is more efficient: for them to each own a lawn mower, or for them to share one?
- (Why don't most neighbors share a lawnmower?)

This is good news! We can cut back on production without sacrificing consumption

# Bad news

- Non-excludable goods require broad coordination
- A lawnmower is excludable: suppose Charlie and Danny buy one together. Can their neighbor Eddie use it? Will he contribute?
- What if Charlie and Danny install lights on the street?
- Free-riding (benefiting from something without paying for it) leads to inefficiency (as well as an unfair distribution of surplus)  
- The central issue in public economics is determining how to organize economies to ensure an efficient and fair allocation of public goods: which public goods to offer, in what quantities, and who should bear the costs.

# Example

Consider 2 consumers with the following demand functions for a public good:

$$
Q_{1} = 1 0 - p

$$

# Free riding problem

- Consider N identical consumers,  $G =$ public good and  $x =$ private good  
How much do consumers choose to buy?  
- Consumers will choose  $g_{i}, x_{i}$  so that:  $MRS_{G, x}^{i} = \frac{P_{G}}{P_{x}}$  
The efficient level of provision is  $G$  so that:  $\sum_{i} MRS_{G,x}^{i} = \frac{P_{G}}{P_{x}}$

$\Rightarrow$  consumers will choose  $g_{i}$  values that are too low

(since  $MRS_{G,x}^{i}$  will be greater then optimal under private provision)

Does this sound like something we've seen before?

Public goods under-provision is an extension of under-provision in the presence of positive externalities: consumers don't factor in they benefit they create for others when they contribute more towards the public good.

Consumer  $i$  chooses  $\mathbf{g}_i, x_i$  so that:  $MRS_{G,x}^i = \frac{P_G}{P_x} = 1$ . For this utility function:  $MRS_{G,x}^i = \frac{x_i}{G} = \frac{x_i}{g_i + g_{-i}} = 1$  where  $x_i = 10 - g_i$

And since consumers are identical,  $g_{-i} = (N - 1)g_i$ $\Rightarrow \frac{10 - g_i}{g_i + (N - 1)g_i} = 1\Rightarrow g_i = \frac{10}{N + 1}\Rightarrow G^p = \frac{N}{N + 1} 10$

The efficient quantity  $G^{e}$  is where:

$$
\begin{array}{c} \sum_{i} M R S_{G, x}^{i} = \frac{\sum_{i} x_{i}}{G} = \frac{P_{G}}{P_{x}} = 1 \\ \frac{N (1 0 - g_{i})}{N g_{i}} = 1 \Rightarrow G^{e} = N g_{i} = 5 N \end{array}
$$

So we can see that the privately-provided quantity  $(G^{p})$  is below the efficient level  $(G^{e})$  for all  $N > 1$ . The higher  $N$  gets, the bigger the gap between them.

For  $N = 2$ ,  $G^{p} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.7$ , while  $G^{e} = 10$

For  $N = 9$ ,  $G^{p} = 9$ , while  $G^{e} = 45$

etc.

# Lindahl pricing

- Proposed mechanism to obtain efficient provision – Lindahl pricing:
- Set G to the efficient level  
- Assign to each person a share of the cost of G they are responsible for  
- Everyone has to agree (on the amount of G to buy)  
- Otherwise, revise the cost shares (i.e. taxes), and ask again how much each consumer is willing to buy  
- Etc.

Problem?

(Decrease the tax share of consumers who claimed they would demand a lower quantity at the proposed level, increase the tax share of consumers with high quantity demanded)

# Example – Lindahl pricing

Can the two consumers arrive at an efficient level of provision through benefits taxation? What taxes will they agree to?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/b95812f3797495d022b3537e211b12727cf37acf82dec8e1463bf9cb6135a5c6.jpg)

If Person 2 is asked to pay \(70 \% * 25 = \\) 17.5 / hour\( & Person 1 is asked to pay \(30 \% * 25 = \\( 7.5 / hour,\) they would both agree to purchase \(Q^{e} = 2.5\)

$\rightarrow$  Efficient level of provision, AND both consumers contribute  
$\rightarrow$  There is no free-riding because consumer 1 knows that if he or she doesn't contribute, the good will not be available at all.

# Example – Lindahl pricing, v2

$\S/$ hour

- Suppose  $MC = \$ 7.5$  
- Efficient provision level:  $G^{e} = 12.5 \rightarrow \mathrm{cost} = \$ 93.75$  
How much benefit does each get at this G level?

Benefit of G to person  $2 =$ 187.5

Benefit of G to person  $1 =$ 50

$\rightarrow$  we might try to set taxes at:  $t_{1} = 20 \%$  (\$1.5)

$$
t_{2} = 80\% \quad (\$ 6)
$$

Will they each benefit under this arrangement?

benefit to person  $2 > t_{2} \times G \times P_{G}$ ? Yes

benefit to person  $1 > t_{1} \times G \times P_{G}$ ? Yes

Will they both agree to it?

No – in fact consumer 1 would say that he/she doesn't demand any units G if asked to pay even a tiny fraction of it, since they know consumer 2 will purchase an amount where  $MB_{1} = 0$  anyway → free riding

\$20  
\$10

$\mathbb{S}$ /hour

To clarify:

In the Lindahl pricing equilibrium (i.e. when taxes are set at a level so that everyone agrees to purchase  $G^{e}$ ), the tax share would have to be proportional to the marginal benefits experienced by each consumer at  $G^{e}$ .

This means any consumers whose MB curve declines to zero at  $G < G^{e}$  will end up paying zero tax.

But this case is even more extreme: in the iterative process of discovering demand for the public good, consumer 1 would claim that the quantity they demand is zero whenever asked to share any of the cost.

# Example – Lindahl pricing, v3

Hours of gardening/week in the park

Can we achieve optimal provision if: MC=\$15?

$$
\left(\mathrm{Re ca ll :} Q^{e} = 7. 5, Q_{1}^{*} = 5, Q_{2}^{*} = 0\right)
$$

$$
\mathrm{Co st} \quad Q^{e} = 1 5 \times 7. 5 = 1 1 2. 5
$$

In order to demand  $G = G^{e} = 7.5$ ,

- consumer 2 would have to be assigned a tax rate of  $\frac{\$12.5}{\$15} \approx 83.3\%$  
- And Consumer 1 would have to be assigned a rate of  $\frac{\$2.5}{\$15} \approx 16.7\%$

Except that consumer 1 also has the option of not contributing at all, and enjoying the 5 units of the public good that consumer 2 would buy (see graphs on next slide)

# Example – Lindahl pricing, v3, cont'd

Consumer 1 gets more surplus from free-riding at the (inefficient) level of private provision than from contributing  $16.7\%$  to the purchase of the efficient level

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/30ae1c017664536464fa5b1e6533b861b6b5318589b9d1b5ed42577e45505142.jpg)  
$\rightarrow$  Same outcome as without the attempt to coordinate the purchase ( $G = 5$ ) (more generally, it's also possible for consumer 1 to contribute, but a smaller amount, so  $G$  is higher than in private case, but still below  $G^{e}$ )

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/1340219d777055423017b751b32d328c74e710b9f2528a0153e0947ad60ba052.jpg)

Asymmetric information

Applications & review

# Asymmetric information

Either the buyer or seller knows more than the other about the good/service being traded

Comes in 2 flavors:

- Adverse selection (hidden attributes)

IMVH I1.a

- Moral hazard (hidden actions)

IMVH 12.a

<table><tr><td></td><td>“plum”</td><td>“lemon”</td></tr><tr><td>Worth to buyer</td><td>10,000</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Worth to seller</td><td>8,000</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td></tr></table>

The expected value (to the buyer) of the cars on the market:

$$
10,000 \times 50 \% + 4,000 \times 50 \% = \$ 7,000
$$

# Lemons

- 2 types of car out there: plums and lemons

The seller knows the category but the buyer doesn't

- The buyer values both cars more than the seller does  $\rightarrow$  so both types should be sold in the efficient outcome.  
- The buyer will offer a price that reflects his expected benefit from the car of uncertain quality.  
The seller of the high quality good will not accept that price.  
$\rightarrow$  Only lemons will be sold

# Moral Hazard

- Moral hazard is the tendency of people to take more risks when they are insured against losses
- E.g. people drive more recklessly if they have generous car insurance.
- Also applies to workplace & business incentives
- Investors in Limited Liability Corporations (LLC) are proected from losing more than their initial investment  $\rightarrow$  they may encourage excessive risk-taking by firm management  
- Paying CEOs through stock options & offering golden parachutes in case of early exit also incentivizes excessive risk-taking ("excessive" from the perspective of workers, who are exposed to the potentially higher risk of losing their job)

The degree of risk workers are exposed to depends on how thick the local labor market for their skills is. A software engineer in Silicon Valley may not suffer significant costs if they get laid off, but an auto plant worker in a small town would likely have to take a much lower-paid job.

# Bank bailouts

# Scenario 1

Suppose the interests of the bank and the public are aligned. E.g., if  $P(good) = P(bad) = 50\%$ , the expected payoffs are:

- From risky investments: \(100 * 50\% + (-500)^{*}50\% = -\\)200\) mil for both  
- From safe investments: \(50*50\% + 0*50\% = \\)25\(mil for both the bank and the public

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/9ba7677dca4db468076b85383ddd3d217c76b2164ef1195362a5c97a4c4f7176.jpg)

# Bank bailouts, cont'd

# Scenario 2

If it is anticipated that the government will intervene to "bail out" the bank, this removes the risk from the bank's perspective. If P(good) = P(bad) = 50%, the expected payoff from risky investments is:

- For the bank:  $100 * 50\% + 0 * 50\% = 50$  
- For the public:  $100 * 50\% + (-300)^{*}50\% = -100$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/f17891b6afe879bf106d60c4432bb9c7cffeec0f9871948f663b88e50b4ecac8.jpg)  
$\rightarrow$ If the bank is tightly interwoven with the rest of the financial system, the threat not to bail them out is not credible  
→The bank will make risky investments and the public will suffer losses (on average)

# Bank bailouts

# Scenario 1 v2

Suppose the interests of the bank and the public are aligned.

E.g., if P(good) = 99%, P(bad) = 1%, the expected payoffs are:

- From risky investments: \(100 * 99\% + (-500)^{*}1\% = \\)94\) mil for both  
- From safe investments: \(50^{*}99\% + 0^{*}1\% = \\)49.5\( mil for both the bank and the public

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/4602219ddb76601de3a51bc25d7acb43a4981112b5246b3964bc996c205c558f.jpg)

→ The bank may pursue risky investments, but only if the odds are sufficiently favorable and the public stands to gain as well.

# Bank bailouts, cont'd

Intervening to rescue large banks removes the downside risk and creates moral hazard: the bank will take more risks than is optimal for the public

The function of "lender of last resort" (fulfilled by the Federal Reserve Bank in the US) is necessary in order to prevent runs on banks – which can sometimes occur for reasons outside of the bank's control.

The Fed can exercise discretion over when to intervene and when not to, but if a bank is "too big to fail", not bailing them out would come at a high cost to the economy

→ The threat to NOT bail them out is not credible

# Solutions?

- Don't allow banks (or any firms) to grow to the point where their failure can imperil the whole economy  
- Bail out the institution, but hold leadership accountable  
- Separate investment banks from depositor-banks, so that risk is confined to investors who can afford the loss (You can read more about Glass-Steagall and the Dodd-Frank Acts)  
- Recommended: podcast series Meltdown

Finish asymmetric information

Applications & review

—Discussion sections tomorrow, but no class Thursday  

- PS 8 is due next Monday at 11pm

# Asymmetric information

Either the buyer or seller knows more than the other about the good/service being traded

We've already introduced:

- Adverse selection (hidden attributes) IMVH I1  
- Moral hazard (hidden actions) IMVH 12

# Adverse Selection

- Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because insurance tends to be purchased more by those who are most costly for companies to insure
- Insurance is most valuable to those who are likely to file many claims

→ insurance premiums need to be higher than if the whole population was insured

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/44409674d2ea0f0c2745a1c1d2b2b0f4acf1e305a140a8727a7140facce7bf3b.jpg)

$\rightarrow$  Lowest risk customers opt out of the market  
$\rightarrow$  Higher premiums

- More generally, adverse selection occurs whenever informational asymmetry makes it difficult to tie price to the good's value

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/c05668ca-6de7-4558-83e9-15faddbfdbc5/1528346722cd15c461c771db311e6466ea310d04b0cb2cdb99e57fbd89245d50.jpg)

→ Many sellers of high quality goods will opt out of the market  
$\rightarrow$  Lower quality goods become overrepresented  
Buyers offer lower prices

In general, markets suffering from adverse selection tend to be smaller than is socially optimal (many trades won't happen, despite there being buyers and sellers who would benefit from trading)

# Adverse Selection, cont'd

- Solutions? (that private firms can implement)
- screening
- testing  
- induce self-selection  
- statistical discrimination
- signaling (e.g. educational degrees & certifications)
- Solutions that the government can implement:
- In critical insurance markets (e.g. health insurance), the government can require everyone to participate in the market  $\rightarrow$  this avoids flight by the lowest risk individuals (already done for car insurance)  
- This individual mandate is essential to prevent the market from unravelling due to adverse selection, especially if we require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions (moral hazard)  
- Alternatively, we could simply offer universal coverage by a public insurance system

# Moral Hazard

- Moral hazard is the tendency of people to take more risks when they are insured against losses
- E.g. people drive more recklessly if they have generous car insurance.
- Also applies to many other areas:
- E.g. a CEO paid in stock options might make risky investments, since he does not lose money if the stock price drops.  
Corporations that are "too big to fail" (i.e. they will be bailed out by the government) are incentivized to take excessive risks, or to issue bonuses rather than invest to make the business robust.  
- Debt forgiveness is often framed as a moral hazard problem.

Why is student loan debt not discharged in bankruptcy – even though all other forms of debt are?

- Avoid creating incentives to get education frivolously (?)  
- Ensure the private market offers student loans

$\circ$  Except that student loans are government-subsidized  
Loans would not be extended for degrees likely to lead to bankruptcy

→ It is unlikely that loans to attend respected universities would dry up  
$\rightarrow$  Even if they did, this would force a change in the system, towards less reliance on debt financing – which is not a bad thing

This currently introduces moral hazard: (quasi-) fraudulent for-profit universities are kept afloat by these subsidies.

# Moral Hazard in employment

- Moral hazard in employment

- Solutions?
- monitoring  
- incentive-compatible contracts

# Moral hazard in employment

# Office Space wisdom

"If I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime, so where's the motivation?"

- No profit sharing  $\rightarrow$  no incentive to work hard to increase profits

I have 8 different bosses right now. […] My only motivation is not to be hassled.

Monitoring is costly, and only incentivizes effort to look like you are working hard  

- The incentives of monitors are also difficult to align with the firm

That, and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that'll only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired."

- The threat of termination can rarely incentivize top effort

# Moral hazard in employment, cont'd

- Would owning firm stock incentivize an optimal amount of effort?
- Not for most employees in large firms (free riding)

What about being paid proportional to output?

- Only practical if output is easy to measure (quantity and quality)  
- Limits creativity (workers avoid taking chances on new methods)
- Keep threat of termination high?
- If employees have equivalent outside options, termination is not a threat  
$\rightarrow$  Firm needs to pay above market wages = "efficiency wages" theory  
- Aggressive culling (e.g. fire bottom  $10\%$  performers) undermines internal trust and cooperation, leads to burnout

What seems to work?

- Give employees some degree of control, a say in company decisions, leverage social mechanisms (company-wide recognition, teams)  
- People don't hate working – they hate meaningless/unchallenging work & lack of control

(Added slide)

# Moral hazard in employment, cont'd

- About free riding incentives: (simple example we went over in the 5pm lecture) Consider a simple scenario, where a firm's profits depend on the combined hours of work that its employees put in:

$\pi = 100H$ , where  $H = H_{1} + H_{2} + \dots + H_{n}$ , for  $n$  employees Each employee gets an equal share of the profit, and suffers some disutility from working:  $U_{i} = \frac{\pi}{n} - H_{i}^{2}$

$\Rightarrow$  An individual's optimization

problem:  $\frac{\partial U_{i}}{\partial H_{i}} = 0$

$$
\Rightarrow \frac{100}{n} \frac{\partial (H_{i} + H_{- i})}{\partial H_{i}} = 2 H_{i} \Rightarrow \boxed {H_{i}^{*} = \frac{50}{n}}
$$

$\Rightarrow H = 50$ , and each gets utility

$$
\begin{array}{l} U_{i}^{*} = \frac{100 \times 50}{n} - \left(\frac{50}{n}\right)^{2} = \frac{5,000}{n} - \frac{2,500}{n^{2}} = \\ \frac{2,500}{n} \left(2 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

What if we maximize the sum of all utilities?

Choose  $H_{1}, H_{2}, \ldots$  so as to maximize:

$\Rightarrow \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial H_{i}} - 2 H_{i} = 0$ , for all  $i$

$$
\begin{array}{l} U_{t o t a l} = \pi - H_{1}^{2} - H_{2}^{2} - \dots - H_{n}^{2} \\ \Rightarrow 100 - 2 \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{i}} = 0 \Rightarrow \boxed {H_{i}^{e} = 50} \\ \end{array}
$$

$\Rightarrow H = 50 n$ , and each gets utility

$$
U_{i}^{e} = \frac{100 \times 50 n}{n} - 2,500 = 2,500
$$

$\Rightarrow U_{i}^{*} = U_{i}^{e}$  only for  $n = 1$

$U_{i}^{*} < U_{i}^{e}$  for all  $n > 1$ : because of free-riding incentives, too little effort is being put in

# Market failure in health insurance

$\rightarrow$  Health insurance and access to healthcare are exacerbated by informational asymmetries – both adverse selection and moral hazard make health insurance extremely expensive on the private market  
$\rightarrow$  Most US adults under 65 years old have health insurance through their (or their spouse's) employer.  
$\rightarrow$  Employers resolve the adverse selection problem (the death spiral of higher premiums  $\rightarrow$  higher risk pool of insured  $\rightarrow$  even higher premiums etc.) by only asking employees to pay for a fraction of the actual cost to ensure them. Employees are still "paying" for the full cost in the sense that they have to accept lower wages as a result, but most of that penalty is felt by all employees, not just the ones who signed up for health insurance.  
$\rightarrow$  Employer-sponsored health insurance works like a tax on labor  $\rightarrow$  bad for both firms and workers (as compared to the alternative of government-sponsored healthcare coverage, such as Medicare for people over 65)  
$\rightarrow$  But, this system does reduce workers' ability to leave their jobs – either in order to switch to a new firm, or to start a new business, or to stop working altogether  $\rightarrow$  they are forced to accept lower wages and worse working conditions  
$\rightarrow$  This further decreases new firm formation and hurts the ability of small businesses to compete for talented employees  
The result is a less dynamic economy, dominated by large and highly profitable corporations that pay low wages

The US healthcare system is more, not less, expensive than that of other developed countries – all of whom offer free universal healthcare coverage to some extent.

This cost differential is partly due to administrative & medical inefficiencies, and partly because the US subsidizes global pharmaceutical innovation by paying far higher prescription prices.

# Asymmetric information in credit markets

The credit market (i.e. the market for loans) suffers from asymmetries of information, which cause both adverse selection and moral hazard, similar to what happens in the market for insurance.

In this example, we will consider 3 applicants (Abe, Bob and Cody) for a small business loan of \$10,000, to be repaid in 1 year:

- Abe intends to invest the money in a very safe project, which will be worth 11,500 next year  
Bob's project comes with a (small) risk of failure  $(10\%)$ , in which case the value of the project will be only half of the initial investment. In exchange for this risk, his project will have a higher value than Abe's if everything goes well  
Cody's project entails even more risk: although if things go well the value will be higher (15,000), there is now a  $50 \%$ chance of failure. (Detailed payoffs on the next slide)  
- If the bank can always recover its payment, regardless of the project's outcome, they would have no reason to care about the riskiness of the project  
- In practice, the bank can't recover money that doesn't exist (and can't force borrowers to take on more debt)  $\rightarrow$  the borrower has limited liability and if a project goes poorly, the bank will have to settle for getting less than what they are owed.

# What conclusions can we draw?

$\rightarrow$  Increasing the interest rate to compensate for a risky applicant pool will drive away safer borrowers (since safe investments tend to only generate moderate returns)  
$\rightarrow$  This increases the riskiness of the applicant pool further  
$\rightarrow$  To break even, the bank would need to charge an even higher interest rate, etc.  
The result is that credit is often not available to interested borrowers at any price (i.e. at any interest rate)

This was an adverse selection example, but we can imagine the same mechanism working through moral hazard scenarios: imagine there is a single applicant, choosing between projects of different levels of risk. At low interest rates, safer projects would appear more appealing, whereas at high interest rates the applicant would be more likely to choose risky strategies.

# What conclusions can we draw? Cont'd

$\rightarrow$  Note that this adverse selection issue arises mainly because borrowers have limited liability.  
$\rightarrow$  In practice, limited liability is both a corporate legal term,

(a "limited liability corporation (LLC)" is a firm whose owners are not held personally liable for the firm's debts – all publicly traded firms and many privately held ones have this protection)

$\rightarrow$  … and a characteristic of personal debt, driven by practical and legal considerations

(If I owe the bank 2 million dollars but only have \$2,000 in cash+assets, then since indentured servitude or selling one's child into slavery are illegal, I can't be held liable for most of my debt in any meaningful way.

Personal bankruptcy laws are intended to further strengthen these limits, by allowing people to wipe away debt while still keeping some assets.)

$\rightarrow$  Limited liability is therefore less of an issue for credit access if the borrower has valuable assets they can pledge as collateral on the loan  
$\rightarrow$  Banks require collateral both in order to actually extract some of their lost value through sale of those assets in case of default, but also because borrowers behave less riskily when they can be held liable for losses. (i.e. default is less likely to begin with)  
$\rightarrow$  Unfortunately, this means that private credit markets mostly just work to provide liquidity for individuals and firms with assets – as opposed to help get businesses off the ground for would-be entrepreneurs with low net worth

# Credit market failure is a big problem

$\rightarrow$  These findings are significant, because throughout our analysis of the perfectly competitive model (since Econ 100B) we implicitly assumed the universal availability of credit at market interest rates  
$\rightarrow$  If it is difficult for new firms to get off the ground, market competitiveness will be reduced  
$\rightarrow$  There are also large consequences for social mobility

$\rightarrow$  Business ownership is an engine for wealth-building  
$\rightarrow$  But it is available disproportionately to people who are already well-off  
$\rightarrow$  (This is particularly true for incorporated businesses, which are separate legal entities from the business owner, and thus offer more liability protection)

There are reliable gains from business ownership regardless of one's starting point. But the likelihood of owning a business varies strongly with the starting point

A similar phenomenon unfolds with education.
