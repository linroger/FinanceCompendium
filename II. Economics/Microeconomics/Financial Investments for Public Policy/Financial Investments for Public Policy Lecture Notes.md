# Financial Investments for Public Policy Lecture Notes

Prof. Carolin Pflueger

University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy

Autumn 2023

## CLASS OUTLINE/ORGANIZATION

## Course Objective

- Financial markets play an important role in public policy
- This class will cover the standard tools of an introductory investments class
- These are great tools for understanding risk and return, whether you are contemplating a career at a Treasury department or in municipal finance, at a central bank, at a pension fund, or in finance industry
- Understanding investments is also important for personal finance decisions
- Stats is important, not just in this class but also in the professional world whenever you need to think about risk and return

By the end of this class you should have the foundations to:

- Make informed investment decisions either on your own behalf or a pension fund, foundation, etc.
- Understand how to assess risk and return of bonds, stocks, and other securities
- Interpret macroeconomic information incorporated in financial markets

This course has significant overlap with BUS 3500 ("Investments") and PPHA 42510 ("Applied Financial Management"), but focuses more on hands-on Excel applications.

## Applied Focus

- You will be expected to find and access real-world investment materials and use these as your sources
- You will learn to find and download real-time financial data
- Use investment theory to analyze the data and inform relevant public policy questions
- Student market updates on Wednesdays based on JP Morgan Weekly Market Recap

## Public Policy Focus

- How is the Fed reflected in financial markets?
- How should a national sovereign wealth fund, such as the Norges Bank Investment Management, allocate its investments between bonds and stocks?
- How should a public pension fund invest in stocks, bonds, and alternatives?

## Course Format

- You are responsible for slides, and Excel exercises posted on Canvas
- Attendance and in-class participation will be factored into your participation grade
- I plan to post basic course recordings on Canvas with subtitles, but this is not a substitute for coming to class!
- In-class polls will be used to help you engage with the class and count for a small part of your participation grade
- Sign up for online office hours!
- Ask and answer questions via Ed Discussions
- TA sessions will be on Fridays 10:30am roughly every other week. Autumn 2023 Revision: 9/26/2023

## Group Assignments Using Excel

- Classes and group homework structured around Excel exercises
- Access data and financial reports
Manipulate and summarize data
- Analyze data using financial theory
- Homework and class Excel exercises are also your practice exam questions
- Exams may use Excel screen shots
- Exams may ask to perform similar, but simpler, computations by hand
- Exams will also ask you to apply concepts to a new context
- Excel is ubiquitous for analyzing financial data
- I expect you be familiar with Excel/google spreadsheets and to acquire new Excel skills independently
- This will be a big plus for your next internship or research assistant position

## Textbook

- Bodie, Kane, Marcus "Investments" (my page references are for 13th Edition, other editions also fine)
- Harvard Business School cases ("Cook County Pension Fund", about \$9)
- I will not simply teach to the textbook. Not all topics in book will be covered.
- Applied materials (real-time data sets, actual government and corporate reports) are messy and more challenging.
- You are responsible for the material in the class slides, assignments, and spread sheets.

## Recipe for Success

- Come to class and ask questions - often your classmates will have the same question and will be grateful!
- Review slides, Excel exercises, and market updates prior to class
- Start assignments well in advance
- Review any questions after class, ideally with a friend
- The best answers don't just get the numbers right, but also have insightful answers to the qualitative questions.
- Consider the classroom opportunity to prepare for your professional career

## Assessment

Exams (Midterm and Final) 60%

Assignments 20%

Class participation 20%

## REVIEW QUESTIONS

## Stats Review Question

Say we have estimated an OLS regression:

$$
X _ {t} = a + b Y _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t}.
$$

The coefficient  $b$  is estimated to be 1.00 with a standard error of 1.05. We can reject that  $b = 0$  at a significance level of

A  $95\%$  percent

B  $90\%$  percent

C both of the above

D none of the above

## Key Financial Instruments

What is money?

- What are government bond markets?
What are stocks?
What are derivatives?
- Which financial instruments protect against inflation?

Reading: Chapter 2 of BKM, Chapter 14 (pp 431-432)

## Money

- Early currencies were backed by commodities (e.g. gold)
- More recent "fiat" currencies have no intrinsic value
- Fiat currencies only derive value because you know that everyone accepts them as money
- Governments can avoid unwanted shocks to the supply of money and adjust the money supply to manage macroeconomic fluctuations

## Money Market (Chapter 2.1)

- Very short-term debt securities
- Highly liquid and easily bought and sold
US government uses Treasury bills to borrow

Pay out 100 dollars at a specified date in the future

- Sell at auction at a price less than 100
- Issued with 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months to maturity
- If issued by a company, this is called "commercial paper"

## Federal Funds Rate

- Just as you have deposits at a bank, many banks in the US have deposits at the Federal Reserve bank ("Fed")
- Banks need to maintain a minimum balance with the Fed, that increases with their amount of customer deposits
- The rate at which banks lend to each other over night is the "Federal Funds rate"
- The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy by changing the Fed Funds rate
- Until 2008, the Federal Reserve used "Open Market Operations", effectively buying and selling Fed Funds to drive the rate towards the desired target
- Now, the Federal Reserve pays interest on Fed Funds

## Bonds

- Federal government also uses Treasury notes and bonds to borrow.
- Notes and bonds are just like T-bills, but they have longer maturities. They also pay interest.
- Notes have maturities between 2 and 10 years. Bonds have maturities up to 30 years.
US Treasury bonds typically pay a fixed coupon twice a year.
- Corporations also issue bonds, that get traded in secondary markets.
- Banks borrow from each other at the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR) rate.

## Eurodollars

- Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks.
- Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks.
- Very liquid and therefore tracked around FOMC announcements
- While T-bill rates, Fed funds rate, Eurodollar, commercial paper etc. may differ because of liquidity and counterparty risk, different short-term interest rates should all be very similar.
- If they were very different one could borrow at the lower rate and invest at the higher. This is called the "Law of One Price" (LOOP)

Figure 23.7 Eurodollar futures

Source: The Wall Street Journal, October 7, 2021.

The Eurodollar contract is essentially a forward contract on the 3-month LIBOR rate. Contracts now trade on three-month and 1-month SOFR, but so far, the LIBOR-based Eurodollar contract still dominates in terms of trading volume.

Both the SOFIR and Eurodollar contracts provide profits (or losses) proportional to the difference between the relevant short-term interest rate at contract maturity and the rate agreed to in the contract. However, the listing conventions for these contracts are a bit peculiar. Consider, for example, the first contract listed in Figure 23.7, which matures in October 2021. The settlement price is presented as  $F_{0} = 99.87$ . However, this value is not really a price. In effect, participants in the contract negotiate over the contract interest rate, and the so-called futures price is actually set equal to  $100 -$  Contract rate. Because the futures price is 99.87, the contract rate is  $100 - 99.87$ , or  $0.13\%$ . Similarly, the final futures price on the contract maturity date will be marked to  $F_{T} = 100 -$  LIBOR. Thus, profits to the buyer of the contract will be proportional to

$$
F _ {T} - F _ {0} = (1 0 0 - \operatorname {LIBOR} _ {T}) - (1 0 0 - \text{Contract rate}) = \text{Contract rate} - \operatorname {LIBOR} _ {T}
$$

Thus, the contract design allows participants to trade directly on the LIBOR rate. The contract multiplier is \(1 million, but the LIBOR rate on which the contract is written is a 3-month (quarterly) rate; for each basis point that the (annualized) LIBOR increases, the quarterly interest rate increases by only \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a basis point, and the profit to the buyer decreases by

$$
. 0 0 0 1 \times \frac {1}{4} \times \$ 1, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 = \$ 2 5
$$

## Equity Securities

- Stocks (or equities or equity securities) represent ownership shares in a corporation
- In contrast to bonds or money market instruments, they do not promise a fixed payment
- Stock owners receive dividends, that go up and down depending on the firm's profitability
- Common stocks entitle their owners to one vote at the corporate annual meeting (e.g. executive compensation)
- Stocks are fairly liquid, though not as liquid as US Treasury T-bills.
- They are traded daily on stock exchanges, such as the NYSE, Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange etc.

## Market Indexes (Chapter 2 of BKM)

- Dow Jones index covers 30 blue chip corporations and has been reported since 1896.
- Price-weighted average, i.e. it assigns higher weight to stocks with a higher price.

S&P 500 covers approximately the 500 largest U.S. corporations.

- It will drop some of the top 500 companies and add others to maintain even industry representation.
- Value-weighted average, i.e. companies with greater market value receive higher weight
- Both are price indexes, i.e. they reflect changes in stock prices but not dividends, which also contribute to returns

## Data Question

- How much did the US stock market change on "taper tantrum" date June 19, 2013 (in %)?
- How much did emerging market stocks change on June 19, 2013?
- How much did developed market stocks change on June 29, 2013?

Hint: Use data from the MSCI Indexes, use gross returns to include dividends

## Derivatives

- Derivatives are contracts between two parties
- Derivatives are based on the prices of other financial market instruments, such as bond or stock prices
- Example: A call option that pays out if the Apple stock price reaches \$250 on 11/1/2019.

## Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) (Chapter 14)

- The US Federal government also borrows using TIPS
- Payments on TIPS are tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Both principal and coupon payments increase with the CPI
- Therefore, the interest rate on these bonds is a real risk-free rate
- Breakeven inflation is defined as the difference between a nominal Treasury and TIPS rate with the same time to maturity
- It is the inflation rate that would make an investor break even (i.e. earn the same return) on both bonds ex post.
Realreturn  $=$  Nominalreturn Inflation

## TIPS Cash Flows

Table 14.1: Principal and interest payments for a Treasury Inflation Protected Security

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Time & Inflation in Year Just Ended & Par Value & Coupon Payment & Principal Repayment & Total Payment \\ \hline
0 &  & \$1,000.00 &  &  &  \\ \hline
1 & 2\% & 1,020.00 & \$40.80 & \$0 & \$40.80 \\ \hline
2 & 3\% & 1,050.60 & 42.02 & 0 & 42.02 \\ \hline
3 & 1\% & 1,061.11 & 42.44 & 1,061.11 & 1,103.55 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
```

The nominal rate of return on the bond in the first year is

$$
\text{Nominal return} = \frac{\text{Interest} + \text{Price appreciation}}{\text{Initial price}} = \frac{40.80 + 20}{1,000} = 6.08\%
$$

The real rate of return is precisely the  $4\%$  real yield on the bond:

$$
\text{Real return} = \frac {1 + \text {Nominal return}}{1 + \text {Inflation}} - 1 = \frac {1.0608}{1.02} - 1 = .04, \text {or} 4 \%
$$

One can show in a similar

Question: If you are a pension fund with inflation-indexed liabilities, do you prefer to receive or pay TIPS?

## Maturity of Outstanding TIPS 1997-2008

US, time to maturity of outstanding bonds

10-year TIPS most common and data most reliable

## Constant-Maturity Bond Yields

- Often, we want to know what is the rate on a "typical" 10-year Treasury
- But there may not be any Treasury bond with exactly 10 years remaining to maturity
- Two approaches:

The Federal Reserve official statistical release uses the most recently issued 10-year note

Fit a smooth function to yields of notes and bonds with different maturities (also from Fed researchers) Gurkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2006)

- When was the last time it was previously at this level?

Hint: Use data from the St. Louis Fred

## Summary Learning Objectives for "Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy"

- Understand major financial instruments: money market, stocks, bonds
- Interpret how bonds and stocks move around FOMC announcements
Estimate inflation compensation from financial markets

# 07 Option Pricing and Applications

## Prof. Carolin Pflueger

University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy

Revision: 11/21/2023

Autumn 2023

## What are Options?

- Options are a form of "derivative" - their prices derive from other securities prices
- They give the holder the option but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock
- The VIX is a measure of market participants' expected volatility based on options prices
- Even if you never trade options directly, their properties are important for understanding applications
- Index-linked certificate of deposit (CD)
Corporate debt has option-like features
- Government guarantees are effectively options written by government

## Learning Goals

Put and call options (BKM, Chapter 20)

2-State option tree (BKM, Chapter 21)

$\Theta$  Black-Scholes formula for option prices (BKM, Chapter 21)

Corporate debt and government guarantees

## Call Options

- A call option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a security at the exercise price  $X$  at a given date  $T$  in the future (the exercise date)
- The payoff of the call option at expiration equals

$$
\text{Payoff t o c a l l h o l d e r} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c c} S _ {T} - X & \text {i f} & S _ {T} > X \\ 0 & \text {i f} & S _ {T} \leq X \end{array} \right.
$$

- Option property: Payoff cannot go negative

Figure 20.2 Payoff and profit to call option at expiration

BKM Figure 20.2

## Put Options

- A put option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell a security at the exercise price  $X$  at exercise time  $T$
- The payoff of a put option at expiry is

$$
\text{Payoff t o p u t h o l d e r} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c c} 0 & \text {i f} & S _ {T} > X \\ X - S _ {T} & \text {i f} & S _ {T} \leq X \end{array} \right.
$$

- Writing (naked) far out-of-the-money puts is a risky strategy, that generates steady fees income most of the time but can lead to large losses in market downturn (October 1987 crash)

BKM Figure 20.4

## Put-Call Parity

Note that

$$
\text {p a y o f f} = S _ {T} - X
$$

- Obtain identical payoff by purchasing one unit of stock and borrowing  $X / (1 + r_f)^T$  T-bills at time 0
- No-arbitrage: Strategies with the same payoff must have same initial price

$$
\operatorname {C a l l} (X) - \operatorname {P u t} (X) = S _ {0} - X / \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) ^ {T}
$$

## Learning Goals

Put and call options (BKM, Chapter 20)

2-State option tree (BKM, Chapter 21)

Black-Scholes formula for option prices (BKM, Chapter 21)

$\bullet$  Valuing government guarantees

## Two-State Option Pricing

- Assume stock can only take two values at expiration
- Current stock price: \(S_0 = \\)100\). Price will either increase to \(120\) or fall to \(\$90\)
- Call option with exercise price \$110
- Interest rate equals  $10\%$

BKM, Chapter 20

## Replicating Portfolio

- Buy one stock, and borrow \$81.82 at 10% interest rate
 Cost of establishing position is $100 - $81.82 = \$18.18
- If stock goes down to  $90, portfolio worth after one year is 90 - 81.82 \times 1.10 = 0$
- If stock goes up to \$120, portfolio payoff is 120 - 81.82 × 1.10 = 30
- Portfolio payoff equals  $3 \times$  option payoff in every possible state
- By no-arbitrage, call option price must satisfy

Argument does not depend on risk-aversion, only no-arbitrage!

## Generalized Option Trees

- What is the price of a call option with exercise price \$110?
- Solve backwards! We can figure out the option price at each time 1 nodes, just as before
- One we have solved for the possible option prices at time 1, find hedge ratio from time 0 to 1

$\bullet$  Black-Scholes formula for option prices (BKM, Chapter 21)

$\bullet$  Valuing government guarantees

## Beyond Binomial Trees

- In reality, stock prices can of course take more than two or three or four values…
- Dividing intervals more and more finely,  $\log S_{t}$  follows approximately a normal distribution
- In this case, there exists a formula rather than just a computer algorithm to determine the price of (European) call and put options
Key assumptions:

- Volatility of stock prices changes is constant over the life of the option
- Risk-free rate is constant
No dividends

## Black-Scholes Formula for Call Option

$$
C _ {0} = S _ {0} N (d _ {1}) - X e ^ {- r T} N (d _ {2}),
$$

$$
d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / X) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}},
$$

$$
d _ {2} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

$C_0 =$  current call option value

$S_0 =$  current stock price

- $N(d) =$  cumulative normal distribution, probability that normal random variable  $\leq d$
- $X =$  exercise price
- $r =$  risk-free rate
- $T =$  time to expiration in years
- $\sigma =$  annualized standard deviation of stock returns

## Determinants of call option price

Increases with the stock price  $S_0$

Decreases with the exercise price  $X$

Increases with volatility  $\sigma$

Increases with time to expiry  $T$

Increases with risk-free rate  $r$

## Black-Scholes Formula for Put Option

From put-call parity:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P = C + X e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}, \\ = X e ^ {- r T} [ 1 - N (d _ {2}) ] - S _ {0} [ 1 - N (d _ {1}) ] \\ \end{array}
$$

Government guarantees

## Government Guarantees

- Governments worldwide will invest tens of trillions of dollars in new investments over the next decade. Which of the many candidate projects should be undertaken? Is entering a public private partnership (P3) cost effective?

Hypothetical toll road with expected annual revenue

- Suppose government guarantees private partner annual revenue of at least \$15 million for 20 years. How much is this worth?
- The government effectively write a string of (naked) put options (one for every year).
- According to Black-Scholes formula, value of this guarantee can be up to \$40.5 million and flip the cost-benefit analysis of the project

Source: Lucas and Montesinos (2020)

## Summary Learning Objectives of "Options"

- Options give holder the right but not the obligation to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a stock at a given price
- Options can be priced using binomial trees
- In certain simplified conditions, they can be priced using the Black-Scholes formula
- Option-pricing matters even if you never trade an option: Index-linked CD, corporate debt, government (credit) guarantees

# 06 Factor Models and Performance Evaluation

Revision: 11/06/2023

Autumn 2023

## What is a Mutual Fund?

- Increasingly, individual investors choose not to trade individual securities for their own accounts.
- Instead, obtain diversification by investing in "mutual funds".
- Accessible to small and large individual investors.
- Assets under management in the U.S. mutual fund industry were approximately \$29.7 trillion in 2021, with approximately the same amount held in non-U.S. funds. (BKM, Chapter 4)

## Evaluating Mutual Fund Performance

- How would you pick a mutual fund for your investments?
- Use information from past returns.
- Looking at total past returns ignores risk.
- We will adjust for risk.
- Good past returns can also be due to a good market rather than superior skill.
- We will evaluate returns relative to benchmarks.
- The risk-return trade-off of mutual funds can be summarized through performance metrics

## Bloomberg Performance Measures

## Decomposing Fund Returns

$$
r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t - 1} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t - 1}\right) + \varepsilon_ {i, t}
$$

- $r_{i,t}$ : return on an asset/investment/portfolio
- $r_{f,t - 1}$ : return on the risk-free asset
- $r_{i,t} - r_{f,t-1}$ : excess return on the asset/investment/portfolio
- $r_{m,t} - r_{f,t-1}$ : excess return on the market
- $\beta_{i}^{m} \times (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t-1})$ : variation in excess returns explained by the market
- $\varepsilon_{i,t}$ : part of excess return not explained by the market

## Decomposing Fund Risks

$$
\underbrace {Var \left(r _ {i , t} - r _ {f , t}\right)} _ {\text {T o t a l R i s k} ^ {2}} = \underbrace {Var \left(\beta_ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m , t} - r _ {f , t}\right)\right)} _ {\text {S y s t e m a t i c R i s k} ^ {2}} + \underbrace {Var \left(\varepsilon_ {i , t}\right)} _ {\text {I d i o s y n c r a t i c R i s k} ^ {2}}
$$

- Total fund risk is the sum of market risk and idiosyncratic risk (also called residual variance or tracking error)

## Estimating Components of Risk

$$
r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t} = a _ {i} + b _ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t}\right) + e _ {i, t}
$$

- The total risk can be estimated as

$$
\sigma \left(r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t}\right)
$$

- The systematic risk can be estimated as

$$
\sigma \left(b _ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t}\right)\right)
$$

- The idiosyncratic risk can be estimated as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma \left(e _ {i, t}\right) = \sigma \left(r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t} - a _ {i} - b _ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t}\right)\right) \\ = \sqrt {\sigma \left(r _ {i , t} - r _ {f , t}\right) ^ {2} - \sigma \left(b _ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m , t} - r _ {f , t}\right)\right) ^ {2}} \\ \end{array}
$$

## Estimating Performance Measures

- Sharpe ratio: Average excess return per unit of total risk

$$
\frac {\overline {{r _ {i , t} - r _ {f , t}}}}{\sigma \left(r _ {i , t} - r _ {f , t}\right)}
$$

- Treynor ratio: Average excess return per unit of systematic risk

$$
\frac {\overline {{r _ {i , t} - r _ {f , t}}}}{b _ {i} ^ {m}}
$$

- Information ratio: Measures abnormal return per unit of tracking error. Measures informativeness of fund's outperformance.

$$
\frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma (e _ {i , t})}
$$

## Performance Measure Depends on Investor's Sophistication

- Mean-variance investor maximizes the Sharpe ratio of the complete portfolio of risky assets.
- Performance measures correspond to three types of investors.
- Investor considering to place all assets with fund: Sharpe ratio.
- Well-diversified investor with a fixed and given complementary portfolio: Treynor ratio.
- Investor who can go long and short index funds tracking the benchmarks: Information ratio.
- All performance measures closely related to fund's CAPM  $\alpha$ .

## Fund performance declines with expense ratio

"Annual excess return" denotes CAPM  $\alpha$

## Multi-Factor Analysis

- In practice, no single factor accounts for all correlations between stock returns.
- Many sources of common variation.
- Industry effects
- Leveraged firms move with interest rates
- Small firms move together
- Any CAPM assumption that does not hold in practice: labor income, future investment opportunities,…
- It matters for performance analysis if investors may already have access to a large range of indexes
- A fund is only attractive to investors if it can outperform the existing fund universe.
Estimate  $\alpha$  relative to multiple benchmark stock portfolios.

## No-Arbitrage Assumption

- Arbitrage opportunity:

Definition: Riskless profit without making net investment

- Widespread arbitrage opportunities would represent the largest form or market irrationality
- If arbitrage was possible, it would be easy to get rich
- Implies "Law Of One Price": Two assets with same payoffs will have same price

## Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

- Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) of Ross (1976) argues that a small number of factors should explain individual stock co-movement and performance.
- Intuitively, a few assets may be mispriced.
- But if too many assets were mispriced, there would be an arbitrage opportunity by grouping them together into a portfolio.
- The mean-variance optimal frontier can be constructed from  $K$  factor portfolios, where  $K$  is small.
- Fund loadings onto factors determine expected return.
CAPM is a special case with the market return as single factor.

## Multi-Factor APT Predictions

In a multi-factor model, expected returns are determined by

$$
E [ r _ {i} - r _ {f} ] = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \beta_ {i} ^ {k} \times R P _ {k}
$$

- There are  $K$  factors,  $k = 1,\ldots ,K$ . Examples of factors are market portfolio, interest rates, GNP growth, rate of inflation, …
- $RP_{k}$  is the risk premium of factor  $k$ :  $E[r_k - r_f]$
- $\beta_{i}^{k}$  is the factor loading of asset  $i$  on factor  $k$

## The Fama-French Factors

- Fama and French (1992) proposed factors based on stock portfolios.
- To date the most influential factors in industry and academia.

Morningstar Matrix for Ariel Appreciation Fund

- Factors explain a large portion of stock co-movement.
- Factors have historically outperformed the market
- HML (high minus low) factor based on value (high book-to-market) firms.
- SMB (small minus big) factor based on small firms.

## Size and B/M Portfolios

- Use CAPM to evaluate returns on size and book-to-market portfolios.
Download data from Ken French's website
Use monthly returns from 1926/07-2011/06 period
- Firms are sorted into 10 equal-sized bins every year by their market equity capitalization (size) and book-to-market equity ratios (B/M).
- Data shows return on portfolio of firms in each of the 10 bins.
- Rebalance portfolios once a year when firms are re-sorted.

## How do these portfolios perform?

What excess returns do they have?

- What CAPM  $\beta$ s do they have?
- What CAPM  $\alpha$ s do they have?

Size Decile Portfolios: Excess Returns

small  $\leftarrow$

## Size Decile Portfolios: CAPM  $\beta$ s

growth/glamour  $\leftarrow$

→value

## B/M Decile Portfolios: CAPM  $\beta$ s

→value

## B/M Decile Portfolios: CAPM αs

## Takeaways: Size and Value Porfolios

- Excess portfolio returns decrease in size and increase in book-to-market equity ratio.
CAPM  $\beta$ s do not explain this heterogeneity in returns across firms.
CAPM  $\alpha$ s are decreasing in size and increasing in book-to-market equity ratio.

## SMB and HML Portfolios

- Can we combine value and size patterns into a trading strategy that outperforms the market?
- Form long-short portfolios based on size and book-to-market

6 Portfolios Formed on Size and Book-to-Market

- SMB (Small Minus Big) is the average return on the three small portfolios minus average return on three big portfolios.

$$
\begin{array}{l} S M B = 1 / 3 \times (S m a l l V a l u e + S m a l l N e u t r a l + S m a l l G r o w t h) \\ - 1 / 3 \times (\text {B i g V a l u e} + \text {B i g N e u t r a l} + \text {B i g G r o w t h}) \\ \end{array}
$$

- HML (High Minus Low) is the average return on the two value portfolios minus the average return on the two growth portfolios

$$
\begin{array}{l} H M L = 1 / 2 \times (S m a l l V a l u e + B i g V a l u e) \\ - 1 / 2 \times (S m a l l G r o w t h + B i g G r o w t h) \\ \end{array}
$$

## Fama-French 3-Factor Model

$$
E \left[ r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t} \right] = \beta_ {i} ^ {m} \times E \left[ r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t} \right] + \beta_ {i} ^ {s} \times E \left[ S M B _ {t} \right] + \beta_ {i} ^ {h} \times E \left[ H M L _ {t} \right]
$$

- Special case of a multi-factor model.
- Factors are market, size, and value returns.
- Portfolios of small companies tend to have high  $\beta^s$
- Portfolios of value companies tend to have high  $\beta^{h}$

## Application: Multi-Factor Analysis of Ariel Appreciation Fund (CAAPX)

$$
r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t}\right) + \beta_ {i} ^ {s} \times S M B _ {t} + \beta_ {i} ^ {h} \times H M L _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {i, t}
$$

Evaluate CAAPX using Fama-French 3-factor model

- Test whether CAAPX provides outperformance after accounting for 'style'.
- Large and liquid HML and SMB index funds widely available to investors.
- Additional fund only attractive to investors if beats this benchmark.
- Effectively standard risk adjustment in mutual fund performance

Autumn 2023

## Overview: Capital Asset Pricing Model

- So far we have computed averages and standard deviations from historical data and asked how investors should behave in this world
- But how should different stocks behave in comparison with one another?
- Key prediction: Expected return on financial asset depends on how it comoves with the market, or beta
Examples:

- Determine the price of a company that has not traded yet
- Budgetary cost of Federal government mortgage guarantees Congressional Budget Office Testimony by Deborah Lucas (2011)

Reading: BKM Chapter 9

## Learning Goals

$\bullet$  Assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model

$\bullet$  Predictions for expected returns on individual securities

Application: Estimating the CAPM

## CAPM Assumptions

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relies on two groups of assumptions

All investors optimize their portfolios a la Markowitz

Financial markets are well-functioning: All assets are traded and investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate

- Of course, all of these assumptions are not true in the real world.
- Nonetheless, the CAPM provides powerful intuition, it remains widely used, and it can be extended in multiple directions.

## CAPM Assumptions

# $\bullet$  Individual behavior

$①$  Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers.

$\Theta$  Their common planning horizon is a single period.

- Investors all use identical input lists, an assumption often termed homogeneous expectations. Homogeneous expectations are consistent with the assumption that all relevant information is publicly available.

## Market structure

All assets are publicly held and trade on public exchanges.

$②$  Investors can borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate, and they can take short positions on traded securities.

$\Theta$  No taxes.

No transaction costs.

## CAPM Equilibrium Intuition

- All investors agree on efficient frontier of risky assets
- Because all investors face the same risk-free rate (Assumption 2.b) they draw the same tangent CAL and arrive at the same risky tangency portfolio
- By the mutual fund theorem, all investors hence hold the same mix of risky assets
- Equilibrium insight: Portfolios must add up
- Because all investors hold the same risky weights, we can conclude that everyone holds a risky portfolio proportional to the market portfolio.
- CAL= Capital Market Line

Takeaway: You can't do better than investing in the market.

## Learning Goals

$\bullet$  Assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model

$\bullet$  Predictions for expected returns on individual securities

Application: Estimating the CAPM

## Expected Return-Beta Relationship

- In equilibrium, GE must be priced so that investors are indifferent whether to buy or sell a small amount
- GE should therefore offer the same risk-return trade-off as the market itself
- How much does GE contribute to risk premium on market? If the weight on GE in the market portfolio is  $w_{GE}$ , this is

$$
w _ {G E} \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {G E} - r ^ {f}\right)
$$

- How much does GE contribute to the risk of the overall market portfolio? This depends on covariance

$$
w _ {G E} Cov \left(r _ {G E}, r _ {M}\right)
$$

## Expected Return-Beta Relationship

- Reward-to-risk ratio for GE and the market must be equal

$$
\frac {\mathbb {E} (r _ {G E} - r ^ {f})}{Cov (r _ {G E} , r _ {M})} = \frac {\mathbb {E} r _ {M} - r ^ {f}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}
$$

- This leads to the most famous relationship of the CAPM:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left(r _ {i} - r ^ {f}\right) = \underbrace {\frac {Cov (r _ {i} , r _ {M})}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}} _ {\mathbb {E} \left(r _ {M} - r ^ {f}\right)}
$$

This is called the 'beta'  $\beta_{i}$

Here,  $i$  can now be any asset, such as  $GE$ ,  $Apple$ ,…

## Formal Argument

- Know that tangency portfolio maximizes overall Sharpe ratio and tangency portfolio equals market.
- Consider increasing the allocation to GE by a small amount  $\omega$ . We must have  $\frac{dSharpe}{d\omega} = 0$ , or else we could increase our Sharpe ratio.
- This is not possible because market=tangency.

$$
{ S h a r p e } { = } { \frac { \omega \mathbb { E } ( r _ { G E } - r ^ { f } ) + \mathbb { E } ( r _ { M } - r ^ { f } ) } { \sqrt { \omega ^ { 2 } \sigma _ { G E } ^ { 2 } + 2 \omega Cov ( r _ { G E } , r _ { M } ) + \sigma _ { M } ^ { 2 } } } }
$$

$$
\left. \frac {d S h a r p e}{d \omega} \right| _ {\omega = 0} = \frac {\mathbb {E} (r _ {G E} - r ^ {f})}{\sigma_ {M}} - Cov (r _ {G E}, r _ {M}) \frac {\mathbb {E} (r _ {M} - r ^ {f})}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {3}}
$$

Setting  $\left.\frac{d\text{Sharpe}}{d\omega}\right|_{\omega = 0} = 0$  gives

$$
\frac {\mathbb {E} \left(r _ {G E} - r ^ {f}\right)}{Cov (r _ {G E} , r _ {M})} = \frac {\mathbb {E} \left(r _ {M} - r ^ {f}\right)}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}
$$

## Discussion

$$
\mathbb {E} \left(r _ {i} - r ^ {f}\right) = \beta_ {i} \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {M} - r ^ {f}\right)
$$

- Expected return on any asset increases with its comovement with the market.
Note that the total volatility of asset  $i$  does not enter.
- In a well-functioning market, investors receive return only if they are willing to bear risk

## The Security Market Line (SML)

BKM Figure 9.2

The SML plots the risk-return trade-off for individual assets. By contrast the CML plots the risk premium of efficient portfolios.

## Evaluating Mutual Fund Performance

BKM Figure 9.3

In this world, only fund managers with positive alpha add to overall investment performance.

## Learning Goals

$\bullet$  Assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model

$\bullet$  Predictions for expected returns on individual securities

Application: Estimating the CAPM

## How to estimate alpha and beta?

$$
r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t - 1} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t - 1}\right) + \varepsilon_ {i, t}
$$

- $r_{i,t}$ : return on an asset/investment/portfolio
- $r_{f,t - 1}$ : risk-free rate
- $r_{i,t} - r_{f,t-1}$ : excess return on the asset/investment/portfolio
- $r_{m,t} - r_{f,t-1}$ : excess return on the market
- $\beta_{i}^{m} \times (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t})$ : variation in excess returns explained by the market
- $\varepsilon_{i,t}$ : part of excess return not explained by the market
- This is sometimes called the "single factor model"

## Empirical Predictions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

$$
r _ {i, t} - r _ {f, t - 1} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} ^ {m} \times \left(r _ {m, t} - r _ {f, t - 1}\right) + \varepsilon_ {i, t}
$$

- Assume that  $r_{m,t}$  is the return on the market portfolio.
- What does the CAPM predict?

A:  $\alpha_{i} = 0$

B:  $\beta_{i}^{m} = 0$

C:  $\varepsilon_{i,t} = 0$

D: All of the above

## Summary Learning Objectives for "Capital Asset Pricing Model"

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) assumes that all investors trade off risk and return, and every asset must be held by someone
- It predicts that the expected return on a stock/mutual fund/nontraded financial asset is proportional to its beta with the market
- Underpriced assets have positive alpha, while overpriced assets have negative alpha
- We can estimate alpha and beta from a simple regression of historical returns onto the market

## Portfolio Choice

University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy

Revision: 10/23/2023

Autumn 2023

## Overview: Portfolio Choice

- How should you split your investments between different stocks, bonds, real estate etc.?
- Portfolio allocation is one of the most important investment decisions for pension funds and individual investors
- We will derive portfolio rules for the two main steps in top-down asset allocation:

④ Decide on how much to invest in each asset class (e.g. stocks vs. bonds?)

2 Decide on asset allocation within each class (e.g. which portfolio of stocks?)

- Main framework: Mean-variance analysis (Markowitz)

Reading: BKM Chapters 6 and 7

## Example Asset Allocation: Cook County Pension Fund

Cook County Pension Fund, accessed 10/18/2020

Question: Why allocate funds to fixed income?

## Learning Goals

$\bullet$  Risk aversion and mean-variance analysis

Optimal risky asset share with one risky and one safe asset

Optimal asset allocation with two risky assets

Application: Investment opportunity set for stocks and long-term bonds

Mutual fund theorem

## What is risk aversion?

- It captures your personal preference. Different for every person.
Key parameter: Risk-aversion  $\gamma$
The higher is  $\gamma$  the more you dislike risk
- Do you prefer a higher expected return with more risk?
- Backcountry skiing in steep terrain is more fun, but also has greater risk
- Or do you prefer a lower expected return in exchange for less risk?

## Risk-Averse (high  $\gamma$ )

https://www.whistler.com/blog/post/2017/01/17/whistler-green-ski-runs/ accessed 10/23/2019

## Risk Aversion and Investments

- Which investment opportunity do you prefer?
- You invest 100 \$ today and can choose between strategies A or B.
In a year, you receive the following:

$\begin{array}{lll}A & 110 & 0\\ Probability & 100\% & 0\% \end{array}$

$\begin{array}{l l l} B & 300 & 0 \\ \text {Probability} & 50\% & 50\% \end{array}$

- Which one do you prefer?
- Which strategy will a risk-averse (high  $\gamma$ ) investor prefer? Which one is a risk-loving investor (low  $\gamma$ )?

## Risk Aversion and Utility Values

- We will assume that each investor assigns a welfare, or utility, score to each portfolio
- Utility increases with expected return
- Utility decreases with expected risk
- Function used both by researchers and practitioners (such as CFA institute)

$$
U = E (r) - \frac {1}{2} \gamma \sigma^ {2}
$$

- The portfolio in question is the investor's overall or complete portfolio

## Concept Check 6.1 (BKM Chapter 6)

- A portfolio has an expected rate of return of  $15\%$  and a standard deviation of  $30\%$ . T-bills offer a safe rate of return of  $7\%$ .
- Would an investor with risk-aversion parameter  $\gamma = 4$  prefer to invest in T-bills or the risky portfolio?

## Learning Goals

$\bullet$  Risk aversion and mean-variance analysis

Optimal risky asset share with one risky and one safe asset

Optimal asset allocation with two risky assets

Application: Investment opportunity set for stocks and long-term bonds

Mutual fund theorem

## Portfolios of One Risky Asset and Risk-Free Asset

- Risky rate of return  $r_P$ , expected risky rate of return  $\mathbb{E}(r_P)$ , standard deviation  $\sigma_P$
- Risk-free rate of returns  $r_f$ , with standard deviation zero
- Invest proportion  $y$  into risky portfolio and  $1 - y$  into risk-free asset
The return on the complete portfolio is

$$
r _ {C} = y r _ {P} + (1 - y) r _ {f}
$$

## Portfolios of One Risky Asset and Risk-Free Asset

Expected return on portfolio:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {C}\right) = y \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {P}\right) + (1 - y) r _ {f} \\ = r _ {f} + y \left[ \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

- Variance of portfolio return:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {Var} \left(y r _ {P} + (1 - y) r _ {f}\right) = \operatorname {Var} \left(y \times r _ {P}\right) \\ = y ^ {2} \operatorname {Var} \left(r _ {P}\right) = y ^ {2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

- Standard deviation of complete portfolio:

$$
\sigma_ {C} = y \sigma_ {P}
$$

- Which risky asset share,  $y$ , is optimal?

## Finding the optimal risky asset share

- Plug into utility:

$$
\begin{array}{l} U = E (r _ {C}) - \frac {1}{2} \gamma \sigma_ {C} ^ {2} \\ = r _ {f} + y \left[ \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] - \frac {1}{2} \gamma y ^ {2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Take the first-order-condition and set it to zero

$$
0 = \left[ \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] - \gamma y \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}
$$

- This implies the optimal risky asset share

$$
y = \frac {1}{\gamma} \frac {\mathbb {E} (r _ {P}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}
$$

## Capital Allocation Line (CAL)

The CAL plots the available mean-standard deviation return combinations

Source: BKM Figure 6.3

- Slope of CAL=Sharpe ratio of risky asset =  $\frac{E(r_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P}$
- If the risky asset is a broad stock index, this is also called the Capital Markets Line (CML).

## Choose feasible allocation on highest indifference curve

Source: BKM Figure 6.7

Visually, the optimal portfolio represents the point,  $C$ , at which the indifference curve is tangent to the CAL.

## Learning Goals

$\bullet$  Risk aversion and mean-variance analysis

Optimal risky asset share with one risky and one safe asset

Optimal asset allocation with two risky assets

Application: Investment opportunity set for stocks and long-term bonds

Mutual fund theorem

## Benefits of Diversification

Source: BKM Figure 7.2

Takeaway: It is beneficial to hold more than one stock. You can significantly reduce your overall portfolio risk by holding an equally-weighted portfolio of  $\geq 20$  stocks.

## Optimal Weights with Two Risky Assets

- Portfolio share  $w_{D}$  in bond fund and share  $w_{E} = 1 - w_{D}$  in equity fund (both of which are risky)
- Rate of return on portfolio equals

$$
r _ {P} = w _ {D} r _ {D} + w _ {E} r _ {E}
$$

Expected rate of return on portfolio is weighted average:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left(r _ {P}\right) = w _ {D} \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {D}\right) + w _ {E} \mathbb {E} \left(r _ {E}\right)
$$

- Variance equals:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} Cov (r _ {D}, r _ {E}), \\ = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} C o r r (r _ {D}, r _ {E}) \\ \end{array}
$$

- The set of combinations for  $\mathbb{E}(r_P)$  and  $\sigma_P$  available to investors is the investment opportunity set

## Optimal Investment Proportions

- Substitute expressions for expectation and variance into utility

$$
\begin{array}{l} U = w _ {D} \mathbb {E} (r _ {D}) + (1 - w _ {D}) \mathbb {E} (r _ {E}) \\ - \frac {1}{2} \gamma \left(w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + (1 - w _ {D}) ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} (1 - w _ {D}) Cov (r _ {D}, r _ {E})\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

- Take the derivative with respect to  $w_{D}$  and setting it to zero  $\frac{dU}{dw_{D}} = 0$
- This gives optimal portfolio shares:

$$
\begin{array}{l} {w _ {D} ^ {*}} = {\frac {\mathbb {E} (r _ {D}) - \mathbb {E} (r _ {E}) + \gamma (\sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - Cov (r _ {D} , r _ {E}))}{\gamma (\sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - 2 Cov (r _ {D} , r _ {E}))},} \\ {w _ {E} ^ {*}} = {1 - w _ {D} ^ {*}} \\ \end{array}

- Slope of CAL is Sharpe ratio of portfolio

## But we can do better…

Choose tangency portfolio  $P$ , which has highest possible Sharpe Ratio

## Optimal Portfolio

- Optimal portfolio is a combination of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio  $P$
- Tangency portfolio  $P$  has weights  $w_{D}$  and  $w_{E}$  in bonds and stocks that generate the highest possible Sharpe ratio
- An investor with risk aversion  $\gamma$  will optimally invest a share  $y = \frac{\mathbb{E}(r_P) - r_f}{\gamma\sigma_P^2}$  in the tangency portfolio and a share  $1 - y$  in the risk-free asset

## Multiple Risky Assets

## Source: BKM Figure 7.10

- Efficient frontier describes portfolios with highest mean at any given standard deviation
Each individual stock/bond is typically below the efficient frontier
- Any portfolio on the efficient frontier is a linear combination of the global minimum variance portfolio and the tangency portfolio
- It is again optimal to hold a combination of the tangency portfolio and the risk-free asset

## Optimal Capital Allocation Line

Mutual Fund Theorem: All investors hold the same portfolio of risky assets (i.e. mutual fund). Only the allocation between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset is different across investors.

## Summary Learning Objectives for "Portfolio Choice"

## Market Efficiency

Fama (1970): "Prices fully reflect all available information".

Malkiel (1992, New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance): "A capital market is said to be efficient if it fully and correctly reveals all available information in determining security prices. (…)It is impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of (information)."

- In practice, market efficiency is often interpreted that it is impossible to forecast returns. Otherwise, we could make trading profits.

- Strictly speaking, this prediction only follows from market efficiency if investors's required compensation for risk does not vary over time.

## Famous Quotes on Market Efficiency

Michael Jensen (1978): "There is no other proposition in economics which has more solid evidence supporting it than the Efficient Markets Hypothesis".

Robert Shiller (1984): "Returns on speculative assets are nearly unforecastable; this fact is the basis of the most important argument in the oral tradition against a role for mass psychology in speculative markets. One form of this argument claims that because real returns are nearly unforecastable, the real price of stocks is close to the intrinsic value, that is, the present value with constant discount rate of optimally forecasted future real dividends. This argument… is one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought".

## Three Types of Market Efficiency

Which information is incorporated into prices and hence be unable to forecast future returns?

- Weak form efficiency. Past returns.
- Semi-strong form efficiency. Past publicly available information, e.g., stock splits, dividends, earnings.
- Strong form efficiency. Past information, even if only available to insiders.
- Empirically, it may be possible to attain abnormal returns using only private information.
- But this is also illegal.

## Why Should Market Efficiency Hold?

- Idea is based on competition
- If prices did not reflect all available information, someone could trade on this
- Investors would bid up price until it reflects information
- Financial markets are competitive, full of smart investors. Don't underestimate your competition!

## Forecasting Stock Returns with Past Returns

- To see whether past stock returns forecast future stock returns estimate regression (AR(1) Model)

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t + 1} = a + \rho r _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} \\ = \mu (1 - \rho) + \rho r _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

- $\mu$ : long-run mean of market returns where  $a = \mu(1 - \rho)$

$$

- $\rho$ : first-order autocorrelation - this is the main coefficient of interest
- $\mu$ : long-run mean of market returns where  $a = \mu(1 - \rho)$
- When  $\rho = 0$ , we call the returns 'iid' = independent and identically distributed
- Consistent with market efficiency
- Implies no predictability in returns

## Illustration: Positive Autocorrelation

- If  $\rho > 0$ , positive returns tend to be followed by positive returns

## Trading Strategies: Positive Autocorrelation

If returns are positively autocorrelated (2-12 month returns)

- Momentum/Continuation trading rules are profitable (on average)
- Buy when price have been going up
Market returns under react to news

- Contrarian/Reversal trading rules are profitable (on average)
Market returns over react to news

- Expect next period's return to be a weighted average of the long-run mean  $\mu$  and the current realized return  $r_t$

## Forecasting Returns

- Conditional expectation  $\mathrm{E}[r_{t + 1}|r_t]$  is expectation of  $r_{t + 1}$  after having observed  $r_t$
$\mathsf{E}[r_{t + 1}|r_t] = (1 - \rho)\mu +\rho r_t$
- Expect next period's return to be a weighted average of the long-run mean  $\mu$  and the current realized return  $r_t$
- Expected next month stock return depends on whether the market recently went up or down!

## Optimal Asset Allocation for Long-Term Investors

- Investor choosing between risk-free asset and stocks
E.g. pension fund invests into  $20\%$  T-bills and  $80\%$  stocks
- Common formula for the risky asset (stock) share is (Chapter 6.5 of BKM)

$$
{ w _ { T } } { = } { \frac { 1 } { \gamma } \frac { \mu _ { T } } { \sigma _ { T } ^ { 2 } } }
$$

- $\mu_T =$  average stock returns expected over  $T$  year horizon
- $\sigma_{T} =$  standard deviation of stock returns over  $T$  year horizon
- $\gamma =$  risk aversion coefficient of mean-variance investor (more on that in the next chapter of the class,

## Definition: Log Return

- For computing returns over time, it is sometimes useful to work with log returns

$$
r _ {t + 1} = \log (1 + R _ {t + 1})
$$

here  $R_{t+1}$  is the level return (i.e. the return we have worked with so far)

- Log return has the desirable feature that

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {t \rightarrow t + 2} = \log \left(\left(1 + R _ {t + 1}\right)\left(1 + R _ {t + 2}\right)\right) \\ = r _ {t + 1} + r _ {t + 2} \\ \end{array}
$$

- Log return approximately equals level return  $r_{t+1} \approx R_{t+1}$  if  $R_{t+1}$  small

## Risk of Long-Term Stocks and the Autocorrelation

- Let's go back to our return predictability regression ( $r_{t+1} = \log \text{return}$ )

$$
r _ {t + 1} = a + \rho r _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1}
$$

Average two-period return

$$
\mu_ {2} = E \left(r _ {t + 1} + r _ {t + 2}\right) = 2 \mu_ {1}
$$

- Variance of two-period return

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} = \operatorname {Var} \left(r _ {t + 1} + r _ {t + 2}\right), \\ = \operatorname {Var} \left(r _ {t + 1}\right) + 2 \operatorname {Cov} \left(r _ {t + 1}, r _ {t + 2}\right) + \operatorname {Var} \left(r _ {t + 2}\right) \\ = \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \rho \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \\ = 2 (1 + \rho) \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

## Long-Term Asset Allocation and the Autocorrelation

- Optimal risky asset share for one-period investor

$$
{w _ {1}} = {\frac {1}{\gamma} \frac {\mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}}
$$

- Optimal risky asset share for two-period investor

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {2} = \frac {1}{\gamma} \frac {\mu_ {2}}{\sigma_ {2} ^ {2}} \\ = \frac {1}{1 + \rho} \frac {1}{\gamma} \frac {\mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}} \\ \end{array}
$$

- Long-term investors should hold a higher risky asset share if autocorrelation is negative ("ride out the ups and downs of the market")

Dividend discount model and predicting stocks from dividend yield

## Linking Dividend-Price Ratio to Stock Returns

- So far, we have used only lagged returns to predict future stock returns.
- There are good reasons to think that the dividend-price ratio (or dividend yield  $\frac{D_t}{P_t}$ ) predicts stock returns

## Dividend Discount Model of  $\frac{D_t}{P_t}$

- Consider the Dividend Discount Model (Gordon Growth Model) with constant expected dividend growth  $G$  and constant expected return  $R$  (Chapter 18.3, BKM)
- Dividends grow at constant rate  $G$  and investors require constant return  $R$ , used for discounting
- Price =Present Value of Expected Future Cash Flows

$$
\begin{array}{l} {P _ {t}} = {\sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \mathsf {E} _ {t} D _ {t + 1} \frac {(1 + G) ^ {i}}{(1 + R) ^ {i + 1}}} \\ = \frac {\mathrm {E} _ {t} [ D _ {t + 1} ]}{R - G} \\ = \frac {(1 + G) D _ {t}}{R - G} \\ \end{array}
$$

## Example 18.2 (BKM)

- Preferred stock that pays a fixed dividend can be valued using constant growth dividend discount model
The constant growth rate is simply zero
- Value a preferred stock paying a fixed dividend of \$2 per share when the discount rate is 8%

## Dividend Yield

- This can be rewritten in terms of the dividend yield

$$
D Y _ {t} = \frac {D _ {t}}{P _ {t}} = \frac {R - G}{1 + G}
$$

- This implies that dividend yields are high if
- $R$  is high
- $G$  is low

## Historical U.S. Dividend-Price Ratio

US S&P Dividend-Price Ratio

## Why are Dividend Yields Time-Varying?

- Back to the Dividend Discount Model intuition
- The only way for the dividend yield to change is if
- $R$  changes
G changes

- Investors and researchers have had very little success predicting dividend growth, especially at long horizons
It follows that

- $DY_{t}$  must provide information about changes in  $R$
Equity returns are predictable using dividend yields

## Predictability Regression

The ability of dividend yields to predict expected returns can be incorporated into a formal regression model

$$
r _ {t + 1} = \alpha + \beta D Y _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t + 1}
$$

## Application 

Using monthly US stock returns

Calculate

Time-series of dividend yields

Estimate the relationship between dividend yields and returns

- Question: Does dividend yield predict stock returns better over longer or shorter horizons?

## Computing Returns

## Holding-Period Returns

- When computing a return, it is important to define the holding period
- When did you buy the stock/bond?
- When did you sell it?
- Without this information the return number is meaningless
Denote the return from time  $t$  to time  $t + 1$  by  $R_{t\rightarrow t + 1}$
- Alternative notation:  $R_{t+1}$  if the length of the holding period is specified clearly elsewhere
Example:  $t =$  September 2019,  $t + 1 =$  September 2020

## Holding-Period Return

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {t + 1} = \frac {P _ {t + 1} + D _ {t + 1} - P _ {t}}{P _ {t}} \\ = \underbrace {\frac {P _ {t + 1} - P _ {t}}{P _ {t}}} _ {\text {C a p i t a l G a i n}} + \underbrace {\frac {D _ {t + 1}}{P _ {t}}} _ {\text {D i v i d e n d Y i e l d}} \\ \end{array}
$$

- $P_{t} =$  beginning price
- $P_{t+1} = \text{end price}$
$D_{t + 1} =$  cash dividend
- This assumes that the dividend is paid at the end of the holding period

- $P_{t} =$  beginning price
- $P_{t + 1} =$  end price
$D_{t + 1} =$  cash dividend
- This assumes that the dividend is paid at the end of the holding period

Example:  $P_{t+1} = 110$ ,  $P_t = 100$ ,  $D_{t+1} = 4$

- What is the holding period return?

## Excess Returns

- If you knew that the stock market offers the same return on average as the bond market, but with a greater standard deviation, would you invest in it?

## Excess Returns

- If you knew that the stock market offers the same return on average as the bond market, but with a greater standard deviation, would you invest in it?
- Excess return is the return on a risky asset above and beyond what could have been earned on the "safe" asset

$$
{X R _ {t + 1}} = {R _ {t + 1} - R _ {t + 1} ^ {r f}}
$$

- It measures how much investors have earned on average for bearing risk
- The average excess return is also called the "risk premium"
- A perfectly safe asset does not exist, however in practice we usually use the rate of return on a T-bill to measure the safe rate of return from time  $t$  to time  $t + 1$ ,  $R_{t+1}^{rf}$ .

## Returns over Different Time Horizons

- You invest one dollar at time  $t$  and earn returns  $R_{t+1}$ , …,  $R_{t+12}$  in months 1, 2, …, 12
- At the end of the year you have  $(1 + R_{t+1}) \times (1 + R_{t+2}) \times \dots \times (1 + R_{t+12})$

## Returns over Different Time Horizons

- You invest one dollar at time  $t$  and earn returns  $R_{t+1}$ , …,  $R_{t+12}$  in months 1, 2, …, 12
- At the end of the year you have  $(1 + R_{t+1}) \times (1 + R_{t+2}) \times \dots \times (1 + R_{t+12})$
- What is the return that you have earned over the full year?

## Returns over Different Time Horizons

- You invest one dollar at time  $t$  and earn returns  $R_{t+1}$ , …,  $R_{t+12}$  in months 1, 2, …, 12
- At the end of the year you have  $(1 + R_{t+1}) \times (1 + R_{t+2}) \times \dots \times (1 + R_{t+12})$
- What is the return that you have earned over the full year?
- Answer:  $R_{t \to t + 12} = (1 + R_{t + 1}) \times (1 + R_{t + 2}) \times \dots \times (1 + R_{t + 12}) - 1$

## Arithmetic Average

- Suppose you want to know what is the typical return earned on the S&P 500 over one year
- In that case, you may want to regard each year as an equally likely "scenario"
- If we have  $T$  annual returns  $R_{t}$ , the expected return is then estimated by the average of the sample rates of return

$$
E \left(R _ {t}\right) = \frac {1}{T} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} R _ {t}
$$

- The standard deviation of returns is a measure of risk and is estimated as

$$
\sigma (R) = \sqrt {\frac {1}{T} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \left(R _ {t} - E \left(R _ {t}\right)\right) ^ {2}}
$$

## Geometric (Time-Weighted) Average

- Suppose, on the other hand, you want to know the constant rate of return that you would have had to earn to have the same  $T$ -year performance
- That is, we want the rate  $g$  such that

$$
\left(1 + g\right) ^ {T} = \left(1 + R _ {1}\right) \times \dots \times \left(1 + R _ {T}\right)
$$

- This is the geometric or (time-weighted) average return

$$
g = \left(\left(1 + R _ {1}\right) \times \dots \times \left(1 + R _ {T}\right)\right) ^ {1 / T} - 1
$$

- Geometric and arithmetic average will be close if returns are small, but can be very different for large returns
Example:  $R_{t} = 100\%$ ,  $R_{t + 1} = -100\%$

## Effective Annual Returns (BKM, p.121)

- The investment in a 25-year bond grows by its maturity by a factor of 4.2918
- The effective annual rate (EAR) is the annual rate of return that would compound to the same value as the actual investment
What is the EAR?

## Comparing Returns with Different Holding Periods

- Not surprisingly, returns over longer holding periods will be larger than returns over shorter holding periods
- It is common to express returns in annualized units, i.e. the annual rate at which the investment would have to grow to generate the actually experience holding-period return
- Example 1: If  $R_{t}$  is a monthly return, the annualized effective return (EAR) is

$$
E A R = \left(1 + R _ {t}\right) ^ {1 2} - 1
$$

- Example 2: If  $R_{t}$  is a 25-year return, the annualized effective return (EAR)

## Bond Yields and Prices

## Present Value

- Let's say you know own an asset that promises to pay  $D_{t+1}$ ,  $D_{t+2}, \ldots$ .
- How much should you be willing to pay for it?
- Price should increase in all future payments, but be less sensitive to payments further in the future
- Let's say the return you require to hold this asset each period is  $r$
The price is then given by the present value

$$
P _ {t} = E \left[ \frac {D _ {t + 1}}{1 + r} + \frac {D _ {t + 2}}{(1 + r) ^ {2}} + \frac {D _ {t + 3}}{(1 + r) ^ {3}} + \dots \right]

## Bond Prices and Yields

- But what is a bond yield?
- In its simplest form, bond yields move inversely with prices

## Bond Prices and Yields

- But what is a bond yield?
- In its simplest form, bond yields move inversely with prices
- For simplicity, consider a zero-coupon bond (i.e. a bond that pays no coupon) trading at time  $t$  and with time to maturity  $n$
- The bond pays  \$1\$ at time t + n$
- The yield to maturity  $Y_{nt}$  is defined by

$$
P _ {n t} = \frac {1}{(1 + Y _ {n t}) ^ {n}}
$$

- The yield is the annualized return if the bond is held to maturity.
- The yield is also the discount rate that equates the price to the present value of the final payoff.

## The Yield Curve

- The yield curve compares the yields of bonds paying out at different points in the future
- The term spread is the difference between a long-term yield and a short-term yield

$$
S _ {n t} = Y _ {n t} - Y _ {1 t}
$$

- A negative term spread (or "inverted yield curve") is often thought to be a predictor of recessions

## Bond Duration

## Coupon Bonds

- Many bonds pay a stream of coupons at rate  $C$  up to and including the maturity date.
- The yield to maturity on a coupon bond is defined implicitly by

$$
P _ {c n t} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {C}{(1 + Y _ {c n t}) ^ {i}} + \frac {1}{(1 + Y _ {c n t}) ^ {n}}.
$$

## Macaulay's Duration

- A measure of the average length of time for which money is invested.
- Use present values of each payment to construct average.

$$
D _ {c n t} = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {i C}{\left(1 + Y _ {c n t}\right) ^ {i}} + \frac {n}{\left(1 + Y _ {c n t}\right) ^ {n}}}{P _ {c n t}}.
$$

Properties of Macaulay's duration:

- Always less than maturity.
- Means maturity for zero coupon bond.
- For positive  $C$ , declining in yield.
- Many bonds sell close to par (i.e.  $P_{cnt} \approx 1$ ). For such bonds, a useful approximation is

$$
D _ {c n t} \approx (1 - (1 + Y _ {c n t}) ^ {- n}) / (1 - (1 + Y _ {c n t}) ^ {- 1}).
$$

## Use Duration to Approximate Bond Returns

- Duration tells you how much the bond price changes when yields change
- Compute approximate return on coupon bond

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} \approx - D \times \Delta y.
$$

- To be more precise you can use "modified duration" (see BKM, equation (16.3)), but for rule-of-thumb calculations simple duration often gets you quite far

Example: The Fed raises rates from  $0\%$  to  $0.25\%$ . You hold a bond that has 8 years to maturity, pays a coupon of  $2\%$  once per year, and sells at par (i.e. the coupon is equal to the yield). What is the approximate percentage change in your position value as a result of this policy?
