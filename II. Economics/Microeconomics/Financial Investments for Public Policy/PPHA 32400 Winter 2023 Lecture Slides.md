# Limit Pricing

- Limit Pricing - a firm sets its price (or its output) so that another firm cannot enter the market profitably  
Example: the incumbent could set a price below the potential rival's marginal cost so entry would be unprofitable.  
Limit pricing is one of many strategies of entry deterrence.

# Limit Pricing through Quantity

First stage: incumbent builds a production plant

□ Inflexible technology: plant produces either 0 or a large quantity  
□ Flexible technology: plant produces 0, or a small, or a large quantity

Second stage: a potential rival decides whether to enter or not  
□ If the incumbent has chosen inflexible technology, the market will be flooded with incumbent's output  
What if the incumbent has chosen the flexible technology instead?  
What strategy (technology) maximizes the incumbent's profit?

# Lecture 8: Nash Equilibrium v. SPNE

# Definitions

- Nash Equilibrium (NE) is a strategy profile in which each player's strategy is a best response to the other players' strategies. In this case, no player has a unilateral incentive to change behavior.  
- Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) is a Nash Equilibrium solved by backward induction. SPNE is also a Nash Equilibrium in every subgame. In light of that, SPNE has a stricter definition than NE. That is, all SPNE must be NE, but not all NE are SPNE.

# Example from Lecture 8, slide 18

Let's see an example which illustrates the difference between SPNE and NE (Lecture 8, slide 18):

# Other Nash Equilibria: SPNE?

${NE} : \left( {L,{MHM}}\right)$

but it's not subgame Profits perfect!

PPHA 32400 Winter 2023 | Lecture 8: Entry Deterrence | 18

- According to the analysis from slide 17, we know that the only SPNE in this game is (H, MML)<sup>1</sup>.
- Slide 18 shows one of the NE in this game: (L, MHM) $^2$ . Let's check if it is truly a NE. That is, what American plays is a best response to what United plays, and vice versa:
- Is  $L$  a best response to MHM? If American knows that United will play MHM, then it will get 3.8 by choosing L, 2.0 by choosing M, and 3.1 by choosing H. Since 3.8 is the highest payoff, American should choose L. That is, L is a best response to MHM.  
- Is MHM a best response to  $L$ ? If United knows that American will play L, then it will get 4.6 by choosing L, 5.1 by choosing M, and 4.6 by choosing H. Since 5.1 is the highest payoff, United should choose M. Note that in this case, it doesn't really matter what United would have chosen had American chosen M or H, as our focus here is the situation that American chooses L. Therefore, we can say MHM is a best response to L.  
- Since what American plays is a best response to what United plays (and vice versa), we have confirmed that (L, MHM) is indeed a Nash equilibrium<sup>3</sup>.
- Next question: Is (L, MHM) a SPNE? To check if it is truly a SPNE, we need to use backward induction:
- In the first subgame (i.e. If American chooses L), United should play M.  
- In the second subgame (i.e. If American chooses M), United should play M, not H.  
- In the third subgame (i.e. If American chooses H), United should play L, not M.  
- Therefore, (L, MHM) is not a SPNE.

Make sure you realize the distinction between a Nash equilibrium and a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium! Try to verify the following:

- (L, MLH) is a NE, but not a SPNE.  
- (M, MMM) is a NE, but not a SPNE.  
- (H, HHL) is a NE, but not a SPNE.

Lecture 9: Market Collusion – Cartels

Navin Kumar

Sheng-Hao Lo

Konstantin Sonin

January 30, 2023

# Cartels

Oligopolistic firms have an incentive to form cartels in which they collude in setting prices or quantities so as to increase their profits.

A cartel forms if members believe that they can raise their profits by coordinating their actions.

# Incentives to Collude

# Airlines Strategic Game

Same airline game as before  
American vs. United  
Market demand:  $Q = 339 - p$  
Production:  $M C = \$ 147$  per passenger

# The Airlines Market Example (A Reminder)

American Airlines and United Airlines compete for customers on flights between Chicago and Los Angeles

□ market:  $Q = 339 - p$  
□ production:  $M C = \$ 147$  per passenger

If there were a monopoly:

$Q = 96,$  
□  $p = \$  243$  
$\square \pi = \$ 9,216$

Oligopoly:

$\square Q = q_{A} + q_{U} = 128$  
$\square p = \$ 211$  
$\square \pi_{A} + \pi_{U} = \$ 8,192$  (\$4,096 each)

# Cournot vs. Monopoly  ${MR} = P + \frac{dP}{dQ}g$

The marginal revenue function for American and United is:

[ MR_{A} = \text{price} + \text{negative impact on price} \times \text{American's output} = MC ]  
[ MR_{U} = \text{price} + \text{negative impact on price} \times \text{United's output} = MC ]

The marginal revenue function for the monopoly:

[ MR = \text{price} + \text{negative impact on price} \times \text{total output} = MC ]

In the American/United example

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \square M R _ {A} = 3 3 9 - q _ {U} - q _ {A} - q _ {A} = M C = 1 4 7 \\ \square M R _ {U} = 3 3 9 - q _ {A} - q _ {U} - q _ {U} = M C = 1 4 7 \\ \square M R = 3 3 9 - q - q = M C = 1 4 7 \end{array} \right.
$$

Cournot: Each player cares about the price impact on its quantity only, not total output.

Monopoly/Cartel: it cares about the price impact on the total output.

# Economic Intuition

The marginal revenue function for American and United is:

[ MR_{A} = \text{price} + \text{negative impact on price} \times \text{American's output} = MC ]  
[ MR_{U} = \text{price} + \text{negative impact on price} \times \text{United's output} = MC ]

The same effect can be observed in the 2x2 game:  
in the "prisoners' dilemma" players do not internalize each other's loss.

# Cartels and Collusion

# Laws Against Cartels

In the late nineteenth century, cartels were legal and common in the United States.

examples: oil, railroad, sugar, and tobacco.

■ Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914,

Prohibit firms from explicitly agreeing to take actions that reduce competition.  
Section 1, Sherman Act

Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal…

# Example: Airlines, 1982

What happened [after 1978 deregulation reform]

□ Robert Crandall, a senior executive soon to become president, and then CEO of American, talked by phone to Howard Putnam, CEO of Braniff Airways  

- Putnam asked Crandall if he had any suggestions on how to deal with the fares, which he considered to be too low  
□ Crandall replied: "Yes. I have a suggestion for you. Raise your goddamn fares 20 percent. I'll raise mine the next morning." And "You'll make more money and I will too."

How it was discovered

Putnam recorded the talk and filed it with regulators.

What happened next

DOJ sued  
□ case was settled for an agreement by Crandall to keep a written record of all his contacts with other airline executives for two years.

# The Dialogue [NYT, 02/23/1983]

Mr. Crandall: I think it's dumb as hell for Christ's sake, all right, to sit here and pound the (expletive) out of each other and neither one of us making a (expletive) dime.  
Mr. Putnam: Well …  
Mr. Crandall: I mean, you know, goddamn, what the (expletive) is the point of it?  
Mr. Putnam: Nobody asked American to serve Harlingen, nobody asked American to serve Kansas City, and there were low fares in there, you know, before. So…  
Mr. Crandall: You better believe it, Howard. But, you … you … you know, the complex is here -ain't gonna change a goddamn thing, all right. We can … we can both live here and there ain't no room for Delta. But there's, ah, no reason that I can see, all right, to put both companies out of business.  
Mr. Putnam: But if you're going to overlay every route of American's on top of, over, on top of every route that Braniff has - I can't just sit here and allow you to bury us without giving our best effort.  
Mr. Crandall: Oh sure, but Eastern and Delta do the same thing in Atlanta and have for years.  
Mr. Putnam: Do you have a suggestion for me?  
Mr. Crandall: Yes, I have a suggestion for you. Raise your goddamn fares 20 percent. I'll raise mine the next morning.  
Mr. Putnam: Robert, we …  
Mr. Crandall: You'll make more money and I will, too.  
Mr. Putnam: We can't talk about pricing.  
Mr. Crandall: Oh (expletive), Howard. We can talk about any goddamn thing we want to talk about.

A federal judge rejected a bid by the four largest U.S. airlines to dismiss nationwide antitrust litigation by passengers who accused them of conspiring to raise fares by keeping seating capacity artificially low.

In a decision late Friday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said she could "reasonably infer the existence of a conspiracy" among American Airlines Group (AAL +2.51%), Delta Air Lines (OAL +1.42%), Southwest Airlines (UV, +0.51%) and United Continental Holdings (UAL +1.56%) to fix prices.

Kollar-Kotelly, who sits in Washington, D.C., did not rule on the merits of the proposed class-action case, which combines 105 lawsuits filed around the country and seeks triple damages.

# U.S. Airlines Unlikely to Face Antitrust Case on Capacity

by David McLaughlin and Michael Sasso

January 11, 2017, 11:48 AM CST

Justice Department was probing supply of available seats  
Federal inquiry included the four largest U.S. airlines

The U.S. Justice Department is unlikely to bring an antitrust action against U.S. airlines after finding little evidence the carriers coordinated to raise fares by curbing the supply of seats, a person familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. has been investigating major U.S. carriers at least since the summer of 2015, when some airlines confirmed getting letters from the Justice Department requesting documents about their actions on seating capacity. The availability of seats is closely tied to air fares, because airlines find it difficult to raise prices when capacity exceeds demand.

Investigators didn't uncover sufficient evidence of collusion among airlines to restrain seats, and it is unlikely the department will pursue any formal action, said the person, who asked not to be named because the probe is confidential. The Justice Department, which rarely confirms a decision to close an investigation, declined to comment.

# Why Cartels Persist

# Cartels Persist

Cartels persist despite these laws for three reasons:

international cartels and cartels within certain countries operate legally.  
some illegal cartels operate believing that they can avoid detection or that the punishment will be insignificant.  
some firms are able to coordinate their activity without explicitly colluding and thereby running afoul of competition laws.

# An International Cartel

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - an international cartel that was formed in 1960 by five major oil-exporting countries:

In 1971, OPEC members agreed to take an active role in setting oil prices.

# Questions

Do you think OPEC is a cartel that affects world oil prices?

Think about different actors that can affect oil price. (non-DPEC nations)  
Think how cartels work: they need to be profitable and sustainable.  
Think about the reasons OPEC exists: is it all about oil profits?

Quotas: limit output in order to raise prices and thus profits Members must trust each other not to break the rule…(difficult)

# The Effect of OPEC?

# Maintaining Cartels

To keep firms from violating the cartel agreement, the cartel must be able to

□ detect cheating and punish violators;  

- keep their illegal behavior hidden from customers and government agencies.

# Mergers

If antitrust or competition laws prevent firms from colluding, firms could try to achieve the same end by merging to form a monopoly.  
U.S. laws restrict the ability of firms to merge if the net effect is to harm society.

# Why Cartels Fail

- Cartels fail if non-cartel members can supply consumers with large quantities of goods. (e.g. competitive fringes)  
Each member of a cartel has an incentive to cheat on the cartel agreement.

# Why Cartel Fails: A Simple Example

Consider two firms, A and B, producing an identical product.

Inverse demand is  $P = 20 - Q$ ;  
Marginal cost is \(MC = \\)4\(

If the firms collude, they will produce the monopoly output.

Equate marginal revenue and marginal cost:  $MR = 20 - 2Q = MC = 4$ .

$$
\Rightarrow Q = 8, P = 2 0 - 8 = 1 2
$$

The price will be  $12, and total profit will be$ 64.

□ Assuming firms split production, each will produce 4 units, and each firm will earn $32 in profit.

$$
\pi = (p - M C) Q = (1 2 - 4) 8 = 6 4
$$

# A Simple Example, ctd.

The problem is that each firm has an incentive to defect.

What happens if Firm A decides to produce 5 units instead of 4?

Total production is 9 units instead of 8, and total industry profit will fall.  
Given inverse demand  $P = 20 - Q$ , the new price will be $11, and total profits will be $63.  $\pi = (11 - 4)q = 63$  
Firm A's profit increases:  $\pi_{A} = (11 - 4) \times 5 = 35 > 32$  
Firm B's profit decreases:  $\pi_{B} = (11 - 4) \times 4 = 28 < 32$

This incentive to defect makes it difficult to maintain collusive agreements.

# Long-term Collusion

# What Makes Collusion Easier?

When it easy to detect and punish cheaters.

Little variation in marginal costs across producers makes collusion easier.

It is difficult to share profits if production costs vary greatly across cartel members.

Long time horizon makes defection more costly.

Future monopoly profits are given more weight, which makes it easier to punish violators of the cartel agreement.

# Strategy and Equilibrium

A player's strategy in a repeated game describes what to do in any circumstances.  
In Nash equilibrium, each player's strategy is a best-response to the other player's strategy.  
In a Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium, each player's strategy is not only a best-response to the other player's strategy, but this property is satisfied in every subgame.  
NB: Unlike finite games, this game cannot be solved by backward induction as there is no last period.

# Cooperation Strategies

"Grim Trigger"  

- "cooperate" (play 48) until either of players stop cooperating (playing 48)
If you cooperate, I will cooperate;
If you deviate today, I will deviate starting next period.  
There are other cooperation strategies.

The answer depends on the discount factor  $\delta$ :

□ $1 tomorrow is equivalent to $δ today.  
□ since tomorrow money worth less,  $\delta < 1$ . (Time Value of Money)

$\delta$  large: patient; value future profits more

δ small : impatient ; value future profits less

# Calculating the Present Value

■ With discount factor  $\delta$ , we can calculate the present value of a stream of income:  
□ for example, if we receive $1 from now, on the present value is

$$
1 + \delta + \delta^ {2} + \delta^ {3} + \dots = \frac {1}{1 - \delta}
$$

Now, what is larger

$\square 5.1 + \delta \times 4.1 + \delta^2 \times 4.1 + \delta^3 \times 4.1 + \dots = 5.1 + \delta \times \frac{1}{1 - \delta} \times 4.1$  or  
$4.6 + \delta  \times  {4.6} + {\delta }^{2} \times  {4.6} + {\delta }^{3} \times  {4.6} + \cdots  = \frac{1}{1 - \delta } \times  {4.6}$  ?

□ If  $\delta < 0.5$ , then 5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1, … is better.  
If  $\delta > 0.5$ , then 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, … is better.

# Long-term equilibrium

Grim trigger strategies

□  $q_{Ut + 1} = 48$  as long as  $q_{At} = q_{Ut} = 48$  
□  $q_{A t + 1} = 48$  as long as  $q_{A t} = q_{U t} = 48$

Is this an equilibrium?

□ If  $\delta > 0.5$ , then

$$
4. 6 + \delta \times 4. 6 + \delta^ {2} \times 4. 6 + \delta^ {3} \times 4. 6 + \dots = \frac {1}{1 - \delta} \times 4. 6
$$

is more than

$$
5. 1 + \delta \times 4. 1 + \delta^ {2} \times 4. 1 + \delta^ {3} \times 4. 1 + \dots = 5. 1 + \delta \times \frac {1}{1 - \delta} \times 4. 1
$$

so, if  $\delta > 0.5$  then grim trigger strategies support collusive equilibrium  
□ otherwise, the only long-term equilibrium is (64, 64) as each company prefers to fly 64 against the other's 48.

Lecture 10: Intertemporal Choice

Navin Kumar

Sheng-Hao Lo

Konstantin Sonin

February 6, 2023

# The Problem of Intertemporal Choice

Most of the analysis we've done of consumers has ignored time.  
Consumers come into existence, get  $M$  in income, spend it, and then vanish.  

- But people live for a long time, over which their incomes vary substantially.

# Smoothing Consumption over Time

Consumers typically want to smooth their consumption.

□ Day-to-day – people do not eat more on their payroll day.  
Over the lifetime – people earn more in some periods of their life.

They may take a loan to increase their present consumption.  

- Or save money to increase their future consumption – usually by purchasing an "asset".  
Today we will take a look at these assets and how they are valued.

# The Plan

We will start with the simplest asset – a savings account.  
Next, a bond which pays out some amount in the future – what is it worth now?  
We will consider the value of a stream of payments – for example, profits from a business.

# A Savings Account

Think of a savings account that pays  $r\%$  annual rate of interest.

□ Interest: a periodic payment tied to an amount of assets borrowed or lent.  
□ Interest rate: interest expressed as a fraction or percentage of the principal.

At the time of lending, the value of the asset is  $V_{0} = A$ .  
After a year, the asset is worth  $A$  plus the interest payment  $Ar$ :

$$
V _ {1} = A + A r = A (1 + r).
$$

The year after that, the asset is worth  $A(1 + r)$  plus  $rA(1 + r)$ :

$$
V _ {2} = A (1 + r) + r A (1 + r) = A (1 + r) (1 + r) = A (1 + r) ^ {2}.
$$

Each year, the value of the asset becomes  $(1 + r)$  times the amount it was worth in the previous year:

$$
V _ {t} = A (1 + r) ^ {t}.
$$

# Compounding

# Compound Interest

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/ea163e3424ee67443452b343e801aead08866aad4f1b6ea2d8a08e4ef05c9b10.jpg)

As time goes on, compounding interest leads to an accelerating growth of savings.  
With a higher interest rate, savings rise even faster.  
Doubling the interest rate more than doubles the returns.

# The Rule of 72

A simple rule of thumb allows to compute the time it will take for a principal amount to double when it is earning a positive interest rate.

Simply divide the number 72 by the annual interest rate.  
□ For instance, with a  $4 \%$ rate of interest, the principal should double every 18 years:  $72 / 4 = 18$ .

# Frequency of Compounding

Sometimes you need to check both the interest rate and the frequency of compounding.  
□ many banks pay interest more frequently than once a year  
If a bank's annual interest rate is  $r = 4\%$ , but it pays interest two times a year, then  
the bank pays you half a year's interest,  $r / 2 =$ $2 \%$ , after six months.  
□ that is, for every dollar in your account, you have  $\left(1 + \frac{r}{2}\right) \times \$ 1 = \$ 1.02$  dollars after six months.  
At the end of the year, the bank owes you

$$
(1 + r / 2) \times (1 + r / 2) = (1 + r / 2) ^ {2} = (1. 0 2) ^ {2} = \$ 1. 0 4 0 4,
$$

which is your original  $\$ 1 plus$ \phi 4.04$ in interest

In the U.S., lenders have to disclose noncompounded APR.

# Continuous Compounding

■ Invest principal of  $P$  at rate  $r$  - what is value V after t years?  
■ Compounded annually

$$
V _ {t} = P (1 + r) ^ {t}
$$

Compounded twice a year

$$
V _ {t} = P \left(1 + \frac {r}{2}\right) ^ {2 t}
$$

1  
Compounded  $N$  times a year

$$
V _ {t} = P \left(1 + \frac {r}{N}\right) ^ {N t}
$$

Continuous compounding

$$
V _ {t} = P e ^ {r t}
$$

# Market Interest Rate

We will be referring to  $r$  as the market interest rate.  
It is the rate that savings accounts pay.  
It is the rate that borrowers can borrow at, and that lenders can lend at.  
In microeconomics course, we are not discussing where the specific value of  $r$  comes from. It is macro, not micro.

# Present Discounted Value

■ When the benefits and/or costs of actions occur at different points in time or accrue over time, it is necessary to compare outcomes.  
The common way to do this is through the use of present discounted value (PDV), the value of a future payment made in terms of equivalent present-period payments.

# The Present Value

To evaluate how future payments compare with payments today, reverse the calculation. " discounting  
A delayed payment is less valuable than a payment today because a payment today can be put to work immediately, earning income.  
The opportunity cost of waiting for a payment is this loss of income.

# A Bond

If we know the interest rate and the value of an asset today, we know its value tomorrow.  
Suppose the market interest rate is  $5 \%$ Then  $\$ 100$ today is worth  $\$ 105$ one year from now.  
Suppose I were to write the following on a sheet of paper: I will pay the bearer of this note $105 on or after Feb 15, 2024. How much can I sell it for?

# Present Discounted Value

If I write on a sheet of paper: I will pay the bearer of this note $105 on or after Feb 15, 2024. How much can I sell it for?

□ Answer: $100.  
One year from now, this bond will be worth $105  
One year from now, a  $100 deposit in a savings account will be worth$ 105. Can't sell for more than $100, since investors would be better off lending their money to others at the market rate!  
The present discounted value of this future payment is given by  $PDV(1 + r) = \$ 105\$, so

$$
P D V = \frac {\mathrm {\\( 1 0 5}}{1 + r} = \frac {\mathrm {\\) 1 0 5}}{1 + 0 . 0 5} = \mathrm {\\) 1 0 0.}$
$$

# Another Exercise

■ Consider a payment of $100 one year from now. The interest rate is  $i = 5\%$ . How much is this worth in today's dollars?

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 100 = P D V \times (1 + i) = P D V \times (1 + 0. 0 5) \\ P D V = \frac {\mathrm {s 1 0 0}}{1 + i} = \frac {\mathrm {s 1 0 0}}{1 . 0 5} = \mathrm {s 9 5 . 2 4} \\ \end{array}
$$

We look for an original principal amount that makes us indifferent between payment today and payment in one year.

This is the present discounted value of the \(100 payment next period.

# Many Periods

Suppose I promise to pay some sum of money  $V_{t}$  on some date that is  $t$  years from now  
We know that  $V_{t} = A(1 + r)^{t}$ , where  $A$  is the initial principal.  
Thus,  $A = \frac{V_t}{(1 + r)^t}$ .  
Here,  $A$  is the PDV of  $V_{t}$ . The lender/saver is indifferent between paying  $A$  for the asset today and putting  $A$  in a savings account for  $t$  years

$$
S a y, t = 2, V _ {2} = 1 1 0, r = 5
$$

$$
A = P D V = \frac {\$ 110}{(1 + 5 \%) ^ {2}} = \$ 100

The PDV of the asset is also the current price of the asset.

Suppose the asset will pay (could be sold for)  $V_{t}$  after  $t$  periods.  
Then the price is inversely related to interest rate  $r$ :

$$
P D V = \frac {V _ {t}}{(1 + r) ^ {t}}.
$$

Intuition: a higher interest rate means that you can invest less money today in order to have the value of a loan grow to  $V_{t}$  in the future

The third payment of  $1,000 two years from now is worth \frac{$ 1,000}{(1+r)2} today.

The PDV of this stream of payment is the sum of the PDV of each payment:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P D V = \\(1,000 + \frac{\)\\(1,000}{1+r} + \frac{\)\\)1,000}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{\$ 1,000}{(1+r)^3}$ \\ = \$ 1,000 + \frac {\$ 1 , 0 0 0}{1 . 0 5} + \frac {\$ 1 , 0 0 0}{(1 . 0 5) ^ {2}} + \frac {\$ 1 , 0 0 0}{(1 . 0 5) ^ {3}} \\ = \$ 1,000 + \$ 952 + \$ 907 + \$ 864 \\ = \$ 3,723. \\ \end{array}
$$

# Present Discounted Value

If payments occur as a stream (for instance, a stream of dividends over  $T$  periods), the present discounted value can be computed as  $PDV = \frac{V_1}{(1 + i)} + \frac{V_2}{(1 + i)^2} + \frac{V_3}{(1 + i)^3} + \dots + \frac{V_T}{(1 + i)^T}$ .

# Present Discounted Value: A Special Case

A special case involves identical payments that occur every period over an indefinite period.  
Let the fixed payment be  $M$ . The present discounted value of a never-ending stream of payments is given by (e.g. perpetuity, ongoing business)

$$
P D V = \frac {M}{(1 + r)} + \frac {M}{(1 + r) ^ {2}} + \frac {M}{(1 + r) ^ {3}} + \dots = \frac {M}{r}
$$

What is the present discounted value of an infinite stream of payments of $20 if the interest rate is 2%? If the rate is 5%?

□ At  $2 \%$ , PDV = $20 / 0.02 = $1,000  
□ At  $5 \%$ , PDV = $20 / 0.05 = $400

# Discount Factor and Interest Rate

# Reminder: Discounting

Discount factor reflects the relative value an individual places on future consumption compared to current consumption

□ $1 tomorrow is equivalent to $δ today;  
since tomorrow money worth less,  $\delta < 1$ .

■ With  $\delta$ , we can calculate the present value of any stream of income:

□ if we receive $X after one period, the present value is δX;  
□ if we receive $X each period from now on, the present value of this stream is X + δX + δ²X + δ³X + … = 1/1-δX.

# Discount Factor and Interest Rate

□ $1 tomorrow is equivalent to $δ today

# Intertemporal Choice

# Choices over Time

Often decisions made by consumers and firms involve comparisons over time.  
One way to make a choice involving time is to pick the option with the highest present value.

# Investing

A firm makes an investment if the expected return from the investment is greater than the opportunity cost.  
The opportunity cost is the best alternative use of its money.

# Net Present Value Approach

If

$R =$  the present value of the expected returns to an investment and  
$C =$  the present value of the costs of the investment,

then  
the firm should make the investment if  $R > C$ .  
In other words, the firm should make an investment only if the net present value is positive:

$$
N P V = R - C > 0.
$$

# Net Present Value Approach, ctd.

The initial year is  $t = 0$ , the firm's revenue in year  $t$  is  $R_{t}$ , and its cost in year  $t$  is  $C_{t}$

□ If the last year in which either revenue or cost is nonzero is  $T$ , the net present value rule holds that the firm should invest if

$$
\begin{array}{l} N P V = R - C \\ = \left[ R _ {0} + \frac {R _ {1}}{\left(1 + \dot {\boldsymbol {r}}\right) ^ {1}} + \frac {R _ {2}}{\left(1 + \dot {\boldsymbol {r}}\right) ^ {2}} + \dots + \frac {R _ {T}}{\left(1 + \dot {\boldsymbol {r}}\right) ^ {T}} \right] \\ - \left[ C _ {0} + \frac {C _ {1}}{(1 + \boldsymbol {r}) ^ {1}} + \frac {C _ {2}}{(1 + \boldsymbol {r}) ^ {2}} + \dots + \frac {C _ {T}}{(1 + \boldsymbol {r}) ^ {T}} \right] > 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

□ alternatively

$$
\begin{array}{l} N P V = \left(R _ {0} - C _ {0}\right) + \frac {R _ {1} - C _ {1}}{\left(1 + r\right) ^ {1}} + \frac {R _ {2} - C _ {2}}{\left(1 + r\right) ^ {2}} + \dots + \frac {R _ {T} - C _ {T}}{\left(1 + r\right) ^ {T}} \\ = \pi_ {0} + \frac {\pi_ {1}}{(1 + \boldsymbol {r}) ^ {1}} + \frac {\pi_ {2}}{(1 + \boldsymbol {r}) ^ {2}} + \dots + \frac {\pi_ {T}}{(1 + \boldsymbol {r}) ^ {T}} > 0. \\ \end{array}

# Exercise

Peter Guber and Joe Lacob bought the Golden State Warriors basketball team for  $450 million in 2010. Forbes magazine estimated the team’s net income for 2009 was$ 11.9 million.  
 If the new owners believed that they would continue to earn this annual profit (after adjusting for inflation), f = $11.9 million, forever, was this investment more lucrative than putting the $450 million in a savings account that pays a real interest rate of r = 2%? At r = 3%?

# Answer

The net present value of buying the Warriors is the difference between the present value of the stream of income,  $11.9 million / 0.02 =$ 595 million, and the present value of the cost, which is the purchase price of $450 million  
\(\square NPV = \\)595\( million - \\)450\( million = \\(145\) million > 0.  
However, if the interest rate were  $3 \%$ , then the present value of the income stream is only $11.9 million/0.03 = $397 million, so the investment would not pay off:  
$\square NPV = \$ 397 - \ $450 = -53 \text{ million} < 0.$

# Supplementary: Internal Rate of Return

# Alternative Approach: Internal Rate of Return

■ Internal rate of return (IRR) - the discount rate that results in a net present value of an investment of zero.

$$
N P V = \pi_ {0} + \frac {\pi_ {1}}{1 + i r r} + \frac {\pi_ {2}}{\left(1 + i r r\right) ^ {2}} + \ldots + \frac {\pi_ {T}}{\left(1 + i r r\right) ^ {T}} = 0
$$

# Internal Rate of Return Approach

■ Again, to get a payment of  $f$  each year forever, you would have to put in the bank  $P = \frac{f}{i}$  
The investment's rate of return is found by rearranging the previous equation and replacing  $i$  with  $irr$ :

$$
i r r = \frac {f}{P}
$$

# Internal Rate of Return Approach

If the firm is borrowing money to make the investment, it pays for the firm to borrow to make the investment if the internal rate of return on that investment exceeds that of the next best alternative:

$$
i r r > i.
$$

# Question

■ Peter Guber and Joe Lacob can buy the Golden State Warriors basketball team for \(450 million, and they expect an annual real flow of payments (profits) of \(f = \)11.9 million forever

□ Using the internal rate of return approach, should they buy the team if the real interest rate is  $2 \%$ ?

# Answer

The internal rate of return from buying the Warriors is

$$
i r r = \frac {f}{P V} = \frac {\mathrm {\\( 11.9 million}}{\mathrm {\\) 450 million}} \approx 2.6 \%
$$

Because this internal rate of return,  $2.6 \%$ , is greater than the real interest rate,  $2 \%$ , buying the team was a good idea.

# Principles of Microeconomics and Public Policy II

Lecture 11: Uncertainty and Risk

Navin Kumar

# Uncertainty and Risk

There are situations in which no single possible outcome is certain to occur, yet the likelihood of each possible outcome is known.

we say, "there is uncertainty" or "there is risk".

# Probability Basics (A Reminder)

# Probability

A probability is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates the likelihood that a particular outcome will occur.

□ if an outcome cannot occur, it has a probability of 0.  
□ if the outcome is sure to happen, it has a probability of 1.  
□ for outcome  $A$ , the probability of outcome is represented by  $Pr(A)$  or, occasionally,  $p_A$ .

# Frequency

How do we know the probabilities? Here is one way.  
Let  $n$  be the number of times one particular outcome occurred during the  $N$  total number of times an event occurred.  
We set our estimate of the probability,  $\theta$ , equal to the frequency:

$$
\theta = n / N.
$$

# Frequency: Example

A house either burns or does not burn.  
If  $n = 13$  houses burned in your neighborhood of  $N = 1,000$  homes last year, you might estimate the probability that your house will burn this year as

$$
\theta = \frac{13}{1,000} = 1.3\%.
$$

■ Frequencies are used to estimate probabilities.

# Probability Distribution

A probability distribution relates the probability of occurrence to each possible outcome.  
□ If possible, outcomes are  $A, B$  and  $C$ , the probability distribution gives  $\operatorname{Pr}(A), \operatorname{Pr}(B)$ , and  $\operatorname{Pr}(C)$ .  
Where outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, exactly one of these outcomes will occur with certainty, and the probabilities must add up to 1 (i.e.,  $100\%$ ).  
For instance, if  $A, B$ , and  $C$  are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, then

$$
P r (A) + P r (B) + P r (C) = 1
$$

# Expected Value: An Example

A promoter schedules an outdoor concert for tomorrow. How much money she will make depends on the weather.

If it does not rain, her profit from the concert is  $V_{\text {no rain}} = \mathbb{S}15.$  
□ If it rains, she will have to cancel the concert and lose money,  $V _ {r a i n} = - \mathbb {S} 5$

The promoter knows that the weather department forecasts a  $50 \%$ chance of rain.

Probability of rain:  $Pr(\text{rain}) = 0.5$  
□ Probability of not rain:  $\Pr(\text{no rain}) = 1 - \Pr(\text{rain}) = 0.5$

# Expected Value

The expected value,  $EV$ , is the sum of the value of each possible outcome times the probability of that outcome.

$$
\begin{array}{l} E V = P r (n o r a i n) \times V _ {n o r a i n} + P r (r a i n) \times V _ {r a i n} \\ = [ 0. 5 \times \$ 1 5 ] + [ 0. 5 \times (- \$ 5) ] = \$ 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

# The Value of Information

Suppose that the promoter could obtain perfect information - she can accurately predict whether it will rain so that she can cancel at no cost.  
How much does the promoter gain by having this perfect information?

# The Value of Information

Suppose that the promoter knows the weather in time to cancel the concert at no cost.

$$
\begin{array}{l} E V = P r (n o r a i n) \times V _ {n o r a i n} + P r (r a i n) \times V _ {r a i n, c a n c e l} \\ = [ 0. 5 \times \$ 1 5 ] + [ 0. 5 \times \$ 0 ] = \$ 7. 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

The expected value without perfect information was  $5, so the value of information is$ 2.5.

# General Formula for the Expected Value

Suppose there are  $N$  mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes.  
□ Given by  $1,2,\dots ,i,\dots ,N$  
The value of outcome  $i$  is  $V_{i}$ .  
Probability of outcome  $i$  is  $p_i$ .  
Since outcomes are exhaustive,  $p_{1} + p_{2} + \dots + p_{i} + \dots + p_{N} = 1$  
Then the expected value is:

$$
E V = p _ {1} \times V _ {1} + p _ {2} \times V _ {2} + \dots + p _ {N} \times V _ {N}
$$

# Variance Variance is the average squared deviation of  $V$  from its mean,  $E[V]$ .

$$
\operatorname {V a r} (V) = \sigma^ {2} = E \left[ (V - E (V)) ^ {2} \right]
$$

Variance  $(\sigma^2)$  measures the spread of the probability distribution.

$\square$ $\sigma$  is the standard deviation, the square root of the variance.

$$
= \sqrt {\sigma^ {2}}
$$

Recall the Expected Value:

$$
E V = p _ {1} \times V _ {1} + p _ {2} \times V _ {2} + \dots + p _ {N} \times V _ {N}
$$

Variance:

$$
\sigma^ {2} = p _ {1} \times (V _ {1} - E V) ^ {2} + \dots + p _ {N} \times (V _ {N} - E V) ^ {2}.
$$

# Variance in the Promoter Example

$\sigma^{2} = \operatorname{Pr}(rain) \times (V_{rain} - EV)^{2} + \operatorname{Pr}(no rain) \times (V_{no rain} - EV)^{2}$

<table><tr><td>Outcome</td><td>Probability</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>No Rain</td><td>0.5</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Rain</td><td>0.5</td><td>-5</td></tr></table>

Expected value: \(5.  
Variance  $\sigma^2 = 0.5 \times (15 - 5)^2 + 0.5 \times (-5 - 5)^2 = 100.$  
Standard deviation  $= 10$ .

# Risk

# A Risky Asset

Consider a bond issued by a firm.  
■ With  $10 \%$ probability, the firm will not exist next year. The bond will be worth $0.  
■ With  $90 \%$ probability, the firm will exist. The bond will be worth $100.

<table><tr><td>Outcome</td><td>Probability</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>Bankruptcy</td><td>0.1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Firm’s alive</td><td>0.9</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

The expected value of this asset is $90.  
If you are offered \(90 or this asset, what would you choose?

# Measures of Risk

One measure of risk is the standard deviation. Holding the expected value constant, the smaller the standard deviation (or variance), the smaller the risk.

<table><tr><td>Outcome</td><td>Probability</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>Bankruptcy</td><td>0.1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Firm’s alive</td><td>0.9</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

Expected value of this asset is \(90 and the variance is

$$
0. 1 \times (0 - 9 0) ^ {2} + 0. 9 \times (1 0 0 - 9 0) ^ {2} = 9 0 0.
$$

Standard deviation is 30.  
Expected value of  $90 (the certainty equivalent) is$ 90 and the variance is 0. This is less risky.  
There is no single measure of risk; the variance is among the most common ones.

# A Fair Bet

A fair bet is a wager with an expected value of zero.  
Example: you flip a coin.

□ If it comes up heads, you pay a dollar.  
□ If it comes up tails, you receive a dollar.  
Because you expect to win half the time and lose half the time, the  $EV$  is:

$$
0. 5 \times (- 1) + 0. 5 \times (1) = 0
$$

# Attitudes Towards Risk

■ Risk averse - unwilling to make a fair bet.  
■ Risk neutral - indifferent about making a fair bet.  
■ Risk preferring - willing to make a fair bet.

# Risk Aversion

# Diminishing Marginal Utility

Consider a person with a diminishing marginal utility of income.  
□ Mathematically, we say that the utility function is concave.  
■ For such a person, the first  $\$ 1$ brings more utility than the second  $\$ 1$ , the second – more than the third, and so on.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/c02495c25341b82898fb613345bbd8f63693818c565529864c6c08a25fb2bfd8.jpg)

# Risk Aversion

Any person with a diminishing marginal utility of income is risk-averse.  
For such a person, the utility of a certain value is higher than the expected utility of a bet with the same expected value.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/a527f098a7a0b76b0bf8bbb27aa534c5c2dded875923ecd661702e57f334dd4b.jpg)

# Risk Aversion

Any person with a diminishing marginal utility of income is risk-averse.  
For such a person, the utility of a certain value is higher than the expected utility of a bet with the same expected value.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/e33295f77985fd278dd47d3e0cc895e72c3eedb38c38f56b9447043380798127.jpg)

# Unwillingness to Take a Fair Bet

Utility function with diminishing marginal utility = utility function is concave. (riskaverse)  
A person whose utility function is concave picks the less risky choice if both choices have the same expected value.

# Risk-Aversion: An Example

■ Adam's utility is a function of his income, which he can use to purchase goods:  $U = \sqrt{I}$ , where income is measured in thousands.  
Suppose Adam's income is \(100,000 a year, but he faces a 50/50 chance of a tornado.

□ If a tornado hits, his income is reduced to \(36,000, as he has to pay for the damages it causes.  
□ If it does not hit, his income remains at $100,000.

[ EI = \frac{1}{2} \times \ $36,000 + \frac{1}{2} \times \$ 100,000 = \$68,000. ]  
$E U = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{36} + \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{100} = 8.$

# Uncertainty, Risk, and Insurance

If Adam had the same amount of income ($68,000) without the risk, his utility would have been higher ( $\sqrt{68} > 8$ ).  
■ Again, the same expected payoff can give different amounts of utility depending on the riskiness of the underlying income levels.

# Adam is Risk-Averse

Adam faces a \(50 \%\)probability of an income of \(100,000 (point B) and a \(50 \%\)probability of an income of \(\$ 36,000\) (point A).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/27d064e197091f16adfaec4384fa0b07649178d7ffdd69377b611da769cb4e40.jpg)

His expected income is \(68,000 and his expected utility is 8 (point C).

$$
\begin{array}{l} E I = \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 3 6, 0 0 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 1 0 0, 0 0 0 = \$ 6 8, 0 0 0. \\ E U = \frac {1}{2} \times \sqrt {3 6} + \frac {1}{2} \times \sqrt {1 0 0} = 8. \\ \end{array}
$$

# Risk Premium

What is the (guaranteed) income level such that Adam is indifferent between getting it for sure and having a risky income?

Because Adam is riskaverse, he is willing to give up as much as  $4,000 in expected income (the distance from point C to point E) to have a certain income of$ 64,000.

A certain income of \\(64,000 also gives Adam a utility of 8 (point E).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/352735c3cb9475a8a54b121e30217a875f0516f9a7eb9785446c9e8fae1ecde2.jpg)

Certainty Equivalent (CE) is the guaranteed income which gives a person the same utility as the expected utility of the risky income.

# The Risk Premium

■ Risk premium - the amount that a risk-averse person would pay to avoid taking a risk.

Adam is willing to give up  $4,000 in expected income in exchange for eliminating his income uncertainty. This$ 4,000 is called the risk premium.

Put differently, Adam must be compensated an extra \(4,000 in expected income to make him as well off when his income is risky as when it is guaranteed.

# Degree of Risk Aversion

(a) Less risk-averse  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/1c12b6e6d48ca5f3e6edd07500c3fd0c4ea9885a256638d31ac60185b55a350b.jpg)

# Diminishing Marginal Utility and Risk Aversion

The same risky bet results in higher utility losses to a person with a lower income.

# Summing up: Uncertainty, Risk, and Insurance

An economic agent who is willing to pay to reduce risk is risk-averse.  
□ Expecting a utility loss from uncertainty or equivalently, being willing to pay for a risk reduction.  
The certainty equivalent is the guaranteed income level at which a potential investor would receive the same expected utility as from an uncertain income  
□ For Adam, this would have been \(64,000.  
A risk premium is the amount an investor must be compensated for bearing risk without a loss in expected utility.  
□ For Adam this would have been \(4,000 \left(\)68,000 —\)64,000\().\)

# Not Risk Averse

# Risk Neutrality

Someone who is risk neutral has a constant marginal utility of wealth - each extra dollar of wealth raises utility by the same amount as the previous dollar.

the utility curve is a straight line in a utility and wealth graph.  
A risk-neutral person chooses the option with the highest expected value, because maximizing expected value maximizes utility.

# Risk Neutrality

■ Risk neutrality is equivalent to having a linear utility of income.  
For such a person, the utility of a certain value is equal to the expected utility of a bet with the same expected value.

# Who Is Risk Neutral?

Economists thinks of firms and banks as risk-neutral.  
It is natural to think of entities that have a lot of independent risky projects as risk-neutral because of the Law of Large Numbers.

Even without the law of large numbers, some of the risks can be diversified away (next lecture).

# The Law of Large Numbers

A series of mathematical theorems in probability theory that can be summarized, for the purposes of insurance business, as follows.  
When the sample of experiment observations increases, variation around the mean observation declines.  
In other words, the higher is the number of [identical] experiments, the higher is the probability that the actual loss will be equal to the expected loss.  $\overline{x} \rightarrow E(x)$  
■ Insurance companies and other financial intermediaries are, effectively, risk-neutral because of the law of large numbers. A large insurance company sells hundreds of thousands of policies, which enables the company to precisely estimate the expected loss per customer, as it can estimate the proportion of customers who will file a claim. This means the company faces very little risk overall.

# Loving Risks

Any person with a convex utility function is a risk lover.  
For such a person, the utility of a certain value is lower than the expected utility of a bet with the same expected value.

# The Willingness to Avoid Risk

Most people are risk-averse.  
Such person is willing to pay to avoid facing a risk.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/7f1877d215e4c028071298120ea1c54ab8d476d45a694ab02f4f8c3952cf8255.jpg)

# Uncertainty, Risk, and Insurance

The fact that economic agents are risk-averse gives rise to insurance.

Insurance is a payment to reduce a risk facing the payer.  
Insurance offers compensation if an undesired outcome occurs.

Complete or full insurance is a policy that leaves the insured individual equally well off regardless of the actual outcome.

This is different from partial insurance, which does not eliminate all risk.  
For instance, insurance policies often carry deductibles that must be paid by the insured.

fully eliminate risks

the risk you need to face

# Insurance: An Example

■ Claire, who is risk averse, wants to insure his store, which is worth $500.

There is a  $20 \%$ probability that his store will burn next year.  
If a fire occurs, the store will be worth nothing.

# Insurance

■ With no insurance, the expected value of Claire's store is \(EV = 0.2 \times \\)0 + 0.8 \times \$500 = \$400.\(  
The variance of the value of her store is

$$
\sigma^ {2} = 0. 2 \times (0 - 4 0 0) ^ {2} + 0. 8 \times (5 0 0 - 4 0 0) ^ {2} = 1 0 0.
$$

# Insurance

(Actuarially) fair insurance - a contract between an insurer and a policyholder in which the expected value of the contract to the policyholder is zero. Insurer's expected profit  $= 0$  
In the example, the insurance company offers to let Claire trade  $1 for$ 5 in the bad state of nature (fire).

$$
\square - \S 1 + 0. 2 \times \S 5 = 0.
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \frac {b a d}{- 1} & \frac {g o o d}{- 1} \\ + 5 \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {E x p e c t e d p r o f i t} \\ = 1 - 5 \cdot (20 \%) = 0 \\ \uparrow \\ \mathrm {i n s u r e r g e t s} & \mathrm {i n s u r e r n e u d s t o} \\ \mathrm {i t f o r s u r e} & \mathrm {p a y c l a r e i n t h e} \\ & \mathrm {b a d s t a t e} \end{array}
$$

# Optimal Insurance

Because Claire is risk averse and the insurance is fair, she wants to fully insure by buying enough insurance to eliminate her risk altogether.  
What the buyer of insurance pays is the insurance premium.

not necessarily equal to the risk premium (which is the willingness to pay).

$$
5 0 0 - x = 4 x,
$$

which solves for \(x = \\)100\(

$$
\frac {\begin{array}{l l} \mathrm {b a d} & \mathrm {g o o d} \\ 0 & 5 0 0 \\ - x & - x \\ + 5 x & \\ 4 x & 5 0 0 - x \end{array} }
$$

■ With insurance, Claire gets $400 with certainty.

Without insurance, he would have  $500 with probability 0.8, and$ 0 with probability 0.2 – the same expected value.

# Another Example: Car Insurance

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/081e45e417590dd63056e7e58d9408568dad5b21766149234245f3476a0bedcd.jpg)

# Example

a risk-averse customer,  $U = \sqrt{I}$ .  
□ a car worth $10,000.

the probability of accident [that destroys the car completely] is 0.01.

# The customer wants full insurance.

The utility of the customer will be the same regardless of what happens.  
A risk-averse customer would always want full insurance.  
□ If the customer pays  $x$  and is fully insured, then their income is  $\$ 10,000 - x$ .

# The Car Insurance Example: Insurer

# Example

a risk-averse customer,  $U = \sqrt{I}$ .  
□ a car worth $10,000.  
the probability of accident [that destroys the car completely] is 0.01.

The customer wants to pay  $x$  and get, in both cases,  $\$ 10,000 - x$ .  
A risk-neutral insurer will accept any  $x$  such that

$E V = x - 0.01 \times \$ 10,000 = x - \$ 100 \geq 0.$ $\Rightarrow x \geq \$ 100$  (fair price) If the insurance market is competitive, then the premium (what the customer pays) will be close to  $100$ .

$$
x = 1 5 0
$$

# Insurance Business

Why insurance company sells insurance?  
They get insurance premiums.

Why insurance companies are risk-neutral?

"law of large numbers";  
diversification.

# Portfolio Management

# Correlation and Diversification

The extent to which diversification reduces risk depends on the degree to which the payoffs of various investments are correlated or move in the same direction.

# Correlation

If there are two (or more) possible investments, one needs to look to their correlation:

□ if two investments are positively correlated, one performs well when the other performs well;  
□ if two investments are negatively correlated, when one performs well, the other performs badly;  
□ if the performances of two investments move independently—do not move together in a predictable way—their payoffs are uncorrelated.

# Correlation and Diversification

Diversification can eliminate risk if two events are perfectly negatively correlated.  
Suppose that two firms are competing for a government contract and have an equal chance of winning.

Because only one firm can win, the other must lose, so the two events are perfectly negatively correlated.  
Today, you can buy a share of stock in either firm for $20.

Next year, the stock of the firm that wins the contract will be worth $40.  
The stock of the loser will be worth $10.

# Correlation and Diversification

If you buy two shares of the same company, your shares are going to be worth either $80 or $20 after the contract is awarded.

The expected value of your two-share portfolio is

$$
E V = 0. 5 \times \$ 8 0 + 0. 5 \times \$ 2 0 = \$ 5 0;
$$

and the variance is

$$
V a r = 0. 5 \times (\$ 8 0 - \$ 5 0) ^ {2} + 0. 5 \times (\$ 2 0 - \$ 5 0) ^ {2} = 9 0 0.
$$

If you buy one share of each, your two shares will be worth $50 no matter which firm wins.

The variance is zero (no risk at all).

# Correlation and Diversification

Diversification does not reduce risk if two events are perfectly positively correlated.  
Another example: suppose you consider buying shares of two oil companies at \(20 each

□ Next year, they will value at $40 if oil prices are high;  
they will value at $10 if oil prices are low.  
The probability that oil prices will be high is  $50\%$ .

$$
\frac {G o o d \quad B a d}{\$ 40 \quad \$ 10}
$$

What is the expected value and variance of an undiversified portfolio? Of a diversified one?

It is the same.

The two companies are effectively the same!

# Imperfect Correlation

Diversification can eliminate some risk if two events are negatively correlated.

In general, the more negatively correlated two events are, the more diversification reduces risk.

■ Consider investment in two firms, oil company A and airline B, whose share price depends on the world oil price. Today, you can buy a share of stock in either firm for $20.

□ Next year, if oil prices are high, the stock of firm A is worth  $40, and the stock of firm B is worth$ 15.  
□ if oil prices are low, the stock of firm A is worth  $10, and the stock of firm B is worth$ 25.  
The probability that oil prices will be high is  $50\%$ .

# Which Investment is Better?

If you buy two shares of company A, your shares are going to be worth either  $80 or$ 20 with equal probability.  
the expected value of your two-share portfolio is

$$
E V = 0. 5 \times \$ 8 0 + 0. 5 \times \$ 2 0 = \$ 5 0;
$$

$\square$  and the variance is  $Var = 0.5 \times (\$80 - \$50)^{2} + 0.5 \times (\$20 - \$50)^{2} = 900.$  
If you buy two shares of company B, your shares are going to be worth either  $50 or$ 30 with equal probability.  
the expected value of your two-share portfolio is

$$
E V = 0. 5 \times \$ 5 0 + 0. 5 \times \$ 3 0 = \$ 4 0
$$

$\square$  and the variance is  $Var = 0.5 \times (\$ 50 - \$ 40)^{2} + 0.5 \times (\$ 30 - \$ 40)^{2} = 100.$

# Diversified Portfolio

If you buy one share of company A and one share of company B, your portfolio will be worth either \(55(= \\)40 + \$15)\( or \)35(= \$10 + \$25)\( with equal probability.

The expected value of your two-share portfolio is

$$
E V = 0. 5 \times \$ 5 5 + 0. 5 \times \$ 3 5 = \$ 4 5;
$$

and the variance is

$$
V a r = 0. 5 \times (\$ 5 5 - \$ 4 5) ^ {2} + 0. 5 \times (\$ 3 5 - \$ 4 5) ^ {2} = 1 0 0.
$$

# Comparing Three Portfolios

Portfolio A + A: high risk, high returns.

$\square EV = \$ 50$  
Var = 900

■ Portfolio B + B: lower returns with a lower risk.

[ \square EV = \$ 40 ]  
$\square$  Var = 100

Diversified portfolio: A + B: returns could be increased without raising risk.

[ \square EV = \$ 45 ]  
$\square$  Var = 100

# Takeaways

Diversification can eliminate some risk if assets' returns are not perfectly correlated.

Diversification reduces risk at the expense of the expected value.

Overall, the higher the risk, the higher the returns.

Diversification mainly aims at reducing risk, not necessarily maximizing returns!

# Efficient and Inefficient Markets

# Market for Risky Assets

An individual investor determines their demand of a risky asset looking for an optimal combination of risk and return.

Risk-averse investors prefer safe assets and low expected returns.  
Less risk-averse investors prefer less safe assets and higher expected returns.

Aggregate demand for risky assets and their supply determine assets' prices.

□ When more people expect that the asset will be more valuable tomorrow, the current price raises and vice-versa.

# Efficient Market Hypothesis

■ Efficient Market Hypothesis: share prices reflect all publicly available information.  
Stock prices follow a "random walk" - past changes tell you nothing about future changes. Stocks always trade at their "fair value" on stock exchanges. Prices change only in response to new information on future profits.  
■ Implication: Traders can't consistently outperform the market with publicly available information. (throwing darts?)  
EMH is a theoretical hypothesis that has a lot of empirical support.  
■ Recommended reading: Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street.

# Inefficient Markets

■ Academic research shows that though financial markets are pretty efficient, some inefficiencies arise.

Large hedge-funds may exploit small market inefficiencies. (e.g. private information)

The idea is that a small inefficiency might bring big revenues if the investment is large enough. (buy low, sell high)

Leveraging investment – borrowing money to invest alongside with your own – allows to further increase the expected returns.

The downside of debt is increased risk.

# Leverage Increases Both Expected Returns and Risk

Suppose that there is an opportunity to invest in a project that

□ with probability 0.5 increases the invested amount by  $20 \%$ ;  
□ with probability 0.5 decreases the invested amount by  $10\%$ .

If you have $100 to invest, then

$$
E V = 0. 5 \times \$ 1 2 0 + 0. 5 \times \$ 9 0 = \$ 1 0 5;
$$

and return on your investment is  $\frac{EV - 100}{100} = 5\%$ .

Suppose that you borrow \(1,000 at a zero interest rate. Then

$$
E V = 0. 5 \times (\$ 1, 3 2 0 - \$ 1, 0 0 0) + 0. 5 \times 0 = \$ 1 6 0;
$$

\(0.9 \times \$ 1,100 = \\) 990 < \$ 1,000.\(

Limited liability!

and return on your investment is  $\frac{160 - 100}{100} = 60 \%$ !

you're only liable to lose the amount you've invested.

# Inefficient Markets: LTCM 1998

Deviation of relative share prices between Royal Dutch and Shell

(supplemental)

The LTCM's spectacular 4-year run and abrupt collapse.

Dual-listed company: Royal Dutch and Shell are two firms which function as a single operating business. They share a single board of directors and have an integrated management structure.

In light of that, LTCM believed that the share prices of both firms would converge in the long run. So it bought lots of Shell's stocks and sold lots of RD's.

In an efficient market, Royal Dutch and Shell shares would never deviate from their 60/40 parity.  
In reality, they deviated significantly, creating an opportunity to invest.  
Unfortunately for LTCM, the inefficiency persisted in 1998, leading to the hedge-fund collapse in August 1998.

# Banks

# Maturity Transformation

Banks use short-term funds (liabilities) to finance long-term projects/loans (assets)

Banks exist to do maturity transformation.

□ Banks' liabilities are deposits, which are short-term or on demand.  
Banks' assets are credits to enterprises and people.

Amount of money people or business can borrow from the bank

Banks provide interest on deposits and charge interest on credits.

□ For banks to make profits, the interest on deposits should be smaller than the interest on credits.  
The spread between the two is determined by the competition in both markets – the market for deposits and the market for credits.

# Banks Provides Insurance: The Need

■ Consider a customer who has  $1 to invest in a project that will bring$ R > 1 if successfully completed. say,  $R = 2, p = 25 \%$  
■ With probability  $p$ , the customer might experience a liquidity shock before the project is completed.

An example of the liquidity shock would be any sudden expense on health, house, kids, etc.

$$
E U = p \times \\ (1) + (1 - p) \times \\ (R).
$$

If the customer is risk-averse, then she would be better off if she could get insurance against the risk of the liquidity shock.

$$
(i. e. l e s s i n c o m e u n c e r t a i n t y)
$$

$$
l e t v = \sqrt {I}, t h e n
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} E U = 25 \% (\sqrt {1}) + 75 \% (\sqrt {2}) \\ \div 1. 3 1 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Banks Provide Insurance: The Opportunity

Suppose that there are many identical customers with uncorrelated liquidity shocks.  
For the bank, there is little uncertainty – thanks to the law of large numbers – about the share of customers that will have liquidity shock.

This share will be  $p$ .

So, the bank collects  $M from the mass of M customers, keep$ p × M in cash and invest $(1 - p) × M into the project.  
After the successful completion of the project, bank will have  $(1 - p)\times M\times R$ . bank serves as if it were au insurance company, since it reduces income uncertainty  
That is, bank is able to pay  $r_1$  to those who withdraw early and  $r_2$  to those who withdraw late so that  $1 < r_1 < r_2 < R$ . bad good If  $r_1 = 1.4$ ,  $r_2 = 1.85$ :

# The Bank Run

Bank pays  $r_{1}$  to those who withdraw early and  $r_{2}$  to those who withdraw late so that  $1 < r_{1} < r_{2} < R$ .  
Because  $r_1 < r_2$ , only customers that do have liquidity shock withdraw money early.  
But what happens if all customers try to withdraw money at the same time?

Other customers  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Withdraw first</td><td>Don’t withdraw</td></tr><tr><td>Withdraw first</td><td>r1,r1</td><td>r1,0</td></tr><tr><td>Don’t withdraw</td><td>0,r1</td><td>r2,r2</td></tr></table>

# The Bank Run is Another Equilibrium

# Other customers

# One customer

(who doesn't

have a liquidity shock)

<table><tr><td></td><td>Withdraw first</td><td>Don’t withdraw</td></tr><tr><td>Withdraw first</td><td>r1,r1</td><td>r1,0</td></tr><tr><td>Don’t withdraw</td><td>0,r1</td><td>r2,r2</td></tr></table>

Everyone but those who have shock stay until the end of the deposit term, (Don't Withdraw, Don't Withdraw), is a Nash equilibrium.  
Recall that  $r_1 < r_2$ .  
Unfortunately, everyone – including those who do not have a liquidity shock – rushes to withdraw, (Withdraw, Withdraw) is a Nash equilibrium as well.

Bank run occurs when people withdraw their money from a bank at the same time, since they believe that bank might be insolvent. As more people withdraw cash, it

is more likely that bank runs out of cash and thus faces bankruptcy.

# Deposit Insurance

Scenario 1: Uninsured

$$
\frac {B a d (1 \%)}{0} \frac {G o o d (9 9 \%)}{1 0 0 0 0} \Rightarrow
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} {E I = 1 \% (0) + 99 \% (10000) = 9900} \\ {E U = 1 \% (\sqrt{0}) + 99 \% (\sqrt{10000}) = 99} \end{array}
$$

Scenario 2: Fully insured

$$
\frac {B a d (1 \%)}{0} \quad \frac {G o o d (9 9 \%)}{1 0 0 0 0}
$$

$$
- x \quad - x \quad \dots
$$

Suppose the premium = \\( x regardless of the state

$$
+ 1 0 0 0 0
$$

the amount firm needs to pay you (in the bad state) so that you'll be equally well off regardless of state (i.e. "fully insured")

$$
\frac {1 0 0 0 0 - x}{x} \cdot \frac {1 0 0 0 0 - x}{x}
$$

Then, how do we determine  $x$ ?

(a) If the insurance plan is "fair", it means zero expected profit for the firm, which implies :

$$
x - 10000 (1 \%) = 0 \longrightarrow x = 100
$$

In this case, you'll have a guaranteed income of

$$
1 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 = 9 9 0 0. S o y o u r u t i l i t y = \sqrt {9 9 0 0} \div 9 9. 5
$$

Since  ${99.5} > {99}$  ,you prefer being fully insured.

(b) Could the firm do better by charging you  $x = {150}$  ?

$\Rightarrow  {Yes}!$  since its expected profit becomes  ${150} - {10000}\left( {1\% }\right)  = {50} > 0.$

Would you still be willing to buy the full insurance plan?

If  $x = {150}$  ,you'll have a guaranteed income of

$$
1 0 0 0 0 - 1 5 0 = 9 8 5 0. S o y o u r u t i l i t y = \sqrt {9 8 5 0} \div 9 9. 2 5
$$

Note that even if your expected income has decreased from 9900 to 9850, you still prefer buying this

full insurance, since your utility is still higher after being fully insured ( 99.25 > 99 ).

→ Risk-averse: You're willing to give up part of your income in exchange for eliminating income uncertainty!

(c) Show that you'll be willing to buy this full insurance at premium  $= x = 199$ , and prefer not to buy it at  $x = 200$  or higher.

- Symmetric information - everyone is equally knowledgeable or equally ignorant about prices, product quality, and other factors relevant to a transaction.  
Asymmetric information - one party to a transaction has relevant information that another party lacks.  
To model informational asymmetry, economists assume that one of the parties knows realization of some random variable, while the other knows only its probability distribution.

# Types of Asymmetric Information

Two types of asymmetric information:  
■ Hidden characteristics - an attribute of a person or thing that is known to one party but unknown to others.  
■ Hidden actions - an act by one party to a transaction that is not observed by the other party.

# Problems Due to Asymmetric Information

Adverse selection occurs when one party to a transaction possesses information about a hidden characteristic that is unknown to other parties.  
Moral hazard is the problem that the informed party might take actions that the other party cannot observe and that harms the less-informed party.

# Adverse Selection in Insurance Markets

■ Were a health insurance company to provide fair insurance by charging everyone a rate equal to the average cost of health care, the company would lose money due to adverse selection:

□ sicker people are more interested in buying insurance;  
□ the average health of those who buy is lower than the average of the whole population;  
□ sellers have to raise prices to not lose money.

The loss of potential surplus occurs because some potentially beneficial sales of insurance to relatively healthy individuals do not occur.  
Adverse selection results in an inefficient market outcome because the sum of producer and consumer surplus is not maximized.

# The Lemons Markets Model

# The Lemons Market

Cars that appear to be identical on the outside often differ substantially in the number of repairs they will need.

Some cars — lemons— have a variety of insidious problems that become apparent to the owner only after the car has been driven for a while.  
The seller of a used car knows from experience whether the car is a lemon.  
We assume that the seller cannot alter the quality of the used car.  
A high-quality car will be called a plum.

# The Loss of Plums: In Brief

Suppose that buyers value plums at  $8,000 and sellers value them at$ 8,000.  
Suppose that buyers value lemons at  $4,000 and sellers value them at$ 3,000.  
Half of all cars are lemons, and buyer can't tell which is which.  
Buyers would be willing to pay \(0.5 \times \\(8,000 + 0.5 \times \\)4,000 = \\(6,000.\)  
Lemon owners happy to sell at this price!  
Plum owners are not; they exit the market.  
Only lemons are traded for some price between  $3,000 and$ 4,000.

# The Lemons Market Example: In Depth

Suppose that there are many potential buyers for used cars.  
1,000 owners of lemons and 1,000 owners of plums are willing to sell.  
Values of the cars to buyers and sellers are

<table><tr><td></td><td>Lemon</td><td>Plum</td></tr><tr><td>Buyers</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sellers</td><td>$3,000</td><td>v</td></tr></table>

# Market Equilibrium with Symmetric Information

If both sellers and buyers know the quality of all the used cars before any sales take place, all the cars are sold, and plums sell for more than lemons.

This market is efficient because the goods go to the people who value them the most.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Lemon</td><td>Plum</td></tr><tr><td>Buyers</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sellers</td><td>$3,000</td><td>v</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$3,000 &lt; p &lt; $4,000</td><td>v &lt; p &lt; $8,000</td></tr></table>

# Asymmetric Information

The amount of information that customers have affects the price at which the cars sell.

√ If no one can tell a lemon from a plum at the time of purchase, both types of cars sell for the same price. (since buyers cannot tell which is  
Sellers of plums are implicitly subsidizing sellers of lemons.  
Depending on the value of  $v$ , plums may be gone from the market completely.

# Market Equilibrium with Asymmetric Information

■ Consider  $v = \$  5,000 $which is less than the buyers' expected value of a randomly chosen car (which is$ 6,000).

<table><tr><td></td><td>Lemon</td><td>Plum</td></tr><tr><td>Buyers</td><td colspan="2">0.5 * $4,000 + 0.5 * $8,000 = $6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sellers</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td colspan="2">To make all cars being sold:
$5,000 &lt; p &lt; $6,000</td></tr></table>

Why are the weights on prices 0.5 and 0.5? Because we assumed there are 1,000 of each type of sellers.

Buyer has an equal chance of buying a lemon or a plum. Hence, the expected value of a used car is  $6,000, which means the buyer is willing to pay$ 6,000 for a car of unknown quality.

# Asymmetric Information: Market Equilibrium

Asymmetric information does not cause an efficiency problem, but does have material implications: (true in the previous case, but not true in

$\checkmark \square$  sellers of lemons benefit (get more than the car is worth for them); general)  

- sellers of plums suffer (get less than they would have gotten absent asymmetric information);  
- consumers who buy the plums get a bargain (paid less than the car is worth);  
□ buyers of lemons are left with a sour taste in their mouths (paid more than the car is worth).

# Market Equilibrium with Asymmetric Information

What if we had  $v = \$  7,000\? Does not work!

<table><tr><td></td><td>Lemon</td><td>Plum</td></tr><tr><td>Buyers</td><td colspan="2">0.5 * $4,000 + 0.5 * $8,000 = $6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sellers</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td colspan="2">To make all cars being sold:
p &lt;= $6,000 but also p &gt;= $7,000</td></tr></table>

Can the market sell only plums instead? What about only lemons?  
Adverse Selection: a situation in which more low-quality and fewer high-quality goods are traded on the market.

# Asymmetric Information: Market Unravels

■ Assume that the sellers of good cars place a value of \( v = \\)7,000 \) on their cars

that is, unwilling to sell them for $6,000.

→ plum sellers exit the market → only lemons stay

What happens in the market?

□ buyers realize that, at any price less than $7,000, they can buy only lemons;  
□ when buyers realize that there are only lemons in the market, they are not willing to pay more than $4,000 for any car in the market;  
□ in equilibrium, the 1,000 lemons sell for the expected (and actual) price between  $3,000 and$ 4,000, and no good cars change hands.  
We call this process market unraveling.

Efficiency implications  
□ this equilibrium is inefficient because high-quality cars remain in the hands of people who value them less ( $7,000) than potential buyers do ($ 8,000).

# Market Equilibrium with Asymmetric Information

There are two possible scenarios:

All cars sell at (up to) the average price.  
Only lemons sell for a price that satisfies both the buyers and the sellers.

The case where all cars are traded is the case of a pooling equilibrium.  
The case where the market distinguishes between different types of products a separating equilibrium.

market unravels (only lemons stag

# The Economics of Adverse Selection: Summary

Adverse selection often arises because sellers of a product have better information about the product's quality—a hidden characteristic—than do buyers.  
If buyers have the same information as sellers, no adverse selection problem arises.  
However, when sellers have more information than buyers, adverse selection may drive high-quality products out of the market. (unraveling)  
Consumers may not make purchases to avoid being exploited by better-informed sellers.  
As a result, not all desirable transactions occur, and potential  
consumer and producer surplus is lost. Those who want to buy plums are not able to buy due to market unraveling!

# An Exercise

Similar setup

Buyers value lemons at  $1,000 and good used cars at$ 2,000.  
The reservation price of lemon owners is  $750 and the reservation price of owners of high-quality used cars is$ 1,250.  
Sellers and buyers are risk neutral.  
The share of owners who have lemons is  $\theta$  (not necessarily  $1 / 2$ )

When information is asymmetric, how do equilibria look like for different values of  $\theta$ ?

# Equilibria

In any pooling equilibrium, the maximum price [that buyers would be willing to pay] is

$$
\begin{array}{l} p = \\(1,000 \times \theta + \\)2,000 \times (1 - \theta). \\ = 2 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 0 \theta \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \theta = 0: p = 2 0 0 0 \\ \theta = 1: p = 1 0 0 0 \end{array} \right. \\ \end{array}
$$

Market with both types of cars exist as long as

$$
p \geq \$ 1,250, \text {w h i c h i s e q u i v a l e n t t o} \theta \leq \frac {3}{4}.
$$

Otherwise, markets unravel.

In this case,  $p \leq \$ 1,000$  and only lemons are sold.

Lemon</td><td>1-θ
Plum</td></tr><tr><td>Buyers</td><td>$1,000</td><td>$2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sellers</td><td>$ 750</td><td>$1.250</td></tr></table>

# Health Insurance

# Health Insurance

The market for health insurance has heterogeneity – some people are at a greater risk for hospitalization than others.  
If risks were observable, the high-risk people would simply pay a higher premium than the low-risk people.  
In practice, the risk is not fully observable, and buyers have more information than sellers.

# The Death Spiral

Suppose that the insurance company prices the premium so that it's actuarily fair. (zero expected profit)  
The price is between what a high-risk consumer and low-risk consumer would pay under full information.  
At this price, the lowest-risk consumers may decide not to purchase, exit the market, raising the risk of hospitalization.  
The price then rises, the second lowest-risk consumers decide not to purchase, and so on, until the market collapses.  
This is known as a "death spiral" in insurance market.

# US Health Insurance

Most people in the US get health insurance through their employer or university via a group policy.  
Such policies remove the link between deciding to buy insurance and riskiness.

A wide variety of customers' types is pooled together.  
Problem: many people are self-employed or unemployed

# Without a Group Policy

People without access to group policies purchase individual policies.  
Before the Affordable Care Act aka Obama healthcare, many insurance companies would base premium on observable risk factors such as age, medical history, etc.  
They would deny coverage for health conditions that existed at the time a policy was purchased, "pre-existing conditions".

The pre-existing condition is any health condition (e.g. asthma, diabetes, cancer, etc) that a person has prior to enrolling in health coverage.

Argument: if people can wait to buy insurance until after they are sick, they would not buy it beforehand!

# The Washington State Experiment

In 1993, Washington state passed a law requiring that insurance companies provide insurance to all those who applied. ("guaranteed issue")  
■ Insurers were not allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.  
The law also required companies to charge all individuals the same price.

□ "Community ratings": the premium could only vary based on zip code and family size.  
They could not charge sick people more, or old people more.

(health status) (age)

# Some Results

■ Initially, the law included a requirement that all residents buy insurance, but this was repealed in 1994 because it was unpopular.  
People began canceling their insurance when they were healthy.  
Premiums skyrocketed, since only high-risk people stayed.  
■ Insurance companies began exiting the market. (death spiral)

The number of insurance companies in the individual market fell from 19 in 1993 to 0 in 1999.  
The law was changed in 2000.  
Those with pre-existing conditions had to wait 9 months for the policy to kick in for that condition.

# Universal Health Coverage

■ Health insurance markets have adverse selection because low-risk consumers do not buy insurance at prices that reflect the average risk.  
Such adverse selection can be eliminated

by providing insurance to everyone;  
□ by mandating that everyone buy insurance.

# Obamacare

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 included both guaranteed issue and a form of community rating.

Premiums were allowed to vary based on age and location.  
The oldest applicants could be charged no more than thrice the youngest applicants.

There is a limited enrollment window, typically Nov 1 to Jan 15.  
There are subsidies for low-income households.

Subsidies are financed via a tax on high-income individuals.

There is an individual mandate— people were required to buy insurance.

□ There was a penalty imposed during the filing of federal taxes. (\$695 or  
The mandate was unpopular and scrapped in 2017.

2.5% of income)

# Supplementary: Reducing Adverse Selection

# Reducing Adverse Selection

Because adverse selection results from one party exploiting asymmetric information about a hidden characteristic, the two main methods for solving adverse selection problems are

□ restricting the ability of the informed party to take advantage of hidden information;  
equalizing information among the parties.

# Alleviating Adverse Selection

Reducing Asymmetric Information Directly

Third-party examinations of quality (e.g., mechanics)  
□ Offering standardized, unbiased information products (e.g., Carfax)

Incentives for Truthful Quality Reporting

□ Reputation (e.g., online feedback).  
□ Warranties and return policies (offered by seller): e.g., laws mandate warranties and return policies for new and used vehicles in many states.

# The Yelp Effect

The Internet has opened up information sources that affect consumers' beliefs about restaurant quality.  
One of the most popular review sites is Yelp.

□ Consumers review local establishments and rate them on a scale of one to five stars.  

- Restaurants are displayed on the Yelp website with ratings rounded to the nearest half star.  
■ Anderson and Magruder (2012) test the importance of Yelp reviews on restaurant popularity by estimating the effect of ratings on table availability 36 hours prior to an evening reservation.

# The Yelp Effect

■ Restaurant quality can drive both higher reviews and lower table availability; it is therefore hard to identify causality.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/79d7c36a57c868cad47cdce66184c92138421ee59c861383b77d9d2589a94e3a.jpg)

□ By looking at the actual rating history, the authors show that a 0.02 difference in average review scores has a large impact only at the threshold at which Yelp ratings change.  
They conclude that a 0.5-star increase in a restaurant rating leads to a  $19\%$  increase in the likelihood that tables will be sold out.

# Supplementary: More Examples

# Natural Disaster Insurance

Recall the problem of adverse selection in insurance:

Consumers know better if they are going to be "expensive" or "cheap"  
□ If insurers have to charge the same price, "expensive" types get indirectly subsidized

Natural disasters: fires (CA), cold snaps (TX), floods (TX, LA, FL, etc.)

Used to be rare, but are projected to keep increasing in frequency.  
Some locations/houses are more susceptible than others.

# Flood Insurance

Empirical fact (Katherine Wagner, 2020)

□ People do not seem to buy flood insurance  
Some numbers: less than  $60 \%$ of households buy insurance in highrisk areas even though expected benefits are more than 1.5x the cost.

Why could this be the case?

Think both about the consumer-side and the producer-side issues

Should the regulator intervene?

In practice, the regulator does: e.g., some states require the purchase of flood protection.

# Healthcare Disaster: Opioid Crisis

Opioid prescription illustrates adverse selection:

□ Patients know whether they are in pain or not  
□ Doctors cannot know for sure

Some numbers:

Since 1999, about 760,000 people died due to drug overdose in the US; in 2018, 2 out of 3 drug overdoses were due to opioids  
1.27mln Americans are receiving medication-assisted treatment  
□ CDC estimates that the total economic burden of opioid addiction is $78.5bn per year.

# Healthcare Disaster: Opioid Crisis

What could be done to deal with the crisis?  
□ Recall the two key ideas about adverse selection: equalizing information levels and preventing opportunistic behavior.  
Consider the doctors' incentives  
Years 2009-2011: up to 1,000 pill mills in Florida prescribing opioids without medical histories for cash  
Consider the role of the secondary market  
Some people get prescriptions to resell the drugs to someone else (sometimes to family members)  
Consider the reasons for engaging in opioid consumption  
Drug use spikes during economic crises (major plant closes, a city goes in lockdown during pandemic, etc.)

# Cheap Talk

# Cheap Talk

Sometimes an informed person voluntarily provides information to an uninformed person.

- costly signal if misinformation imposes a cost on the informed person.  
cheap talk if false claims or statements do not impose a direct cost.

Costly signal is communication between players in which sending certain signals may be costly for the sender (informed person).

- Cheap talk is communication between players that does not directly impact the final payoffs of players, as providing and receiving information is low-cost or free.

# Cheap Talk: An Example

Suppose that a firm plans to hire Cyndi to do one of two jobs.

The demanding job requires someone with high ability.  
The undemanding job can be done better by someone of low ability because the job bores more able people, who then perform poorly.

The payoff to the firm is higher if Cyndi is properly matched to the job.

Cyndi knows her ability level, but the firm is unsure. It thinks either level is equally likely.

Can cheap talk help?

WARNING: These

are payoffs, not a

2x2 game

# Cyndi's characteristics

It depends on Cyndi's characteristics.  
Suppose the demanding job pays 4.  
Undemanding job pays 2.  
A high-ability worker takes  $-1$  in psychological damage from the boring undemanding job.

# When Cheap Talk Works

Suppose that low quality workers get  $-3$  psychological damage from the demanding job  

- Cheap talk generates separating equilibrium!

Knowing the firm would assign her to the appropriate job, Cyndi has no incentive to lie.

# When Cheap Talk Fails

Suppose that low-ability workers get  $-1$  from the demanding job.

# Education as Costly Signal

# Education as a Signal

If high-ability people are more likely to go to college than low-ability people, schooling might signal ability to employers.  
Evidence suggests that better schools do provide better training, yet consider the world, in which schooling provides no useful training at all.  
Does this mean that this school's diploma has no value?

Assume that diploma serves as the signal only -- schooling provides no training that is useful to the firm.

# Education as a Signal: A Model

In a separating equilibrium,

□ high-ability people pay  $c$  to get a degree and are employed at a wage of  $w_{h}$  
□ low-ability individuals do not get a degree and work for a wage of  $w_{l}$

A high-ability person chooses to get a degree if  $w_{h} - w_{l} > c$

A degree is a costly signal of ability!

Without a degree, high-ability workers are viewed as low ability once hired, and they receive  $w_{k}$ . If they go to school, their net earnings is  $W_{h} - c$ .

In a separating equilibrium, the extra pay outweighs the cost of schooling.

# Pooling Equilibrium

It does not pay for the high-ability person to graduate if the benefit from graduating, the extra pay is less than the cost of schooling.  
In a pooling equilibrium, all workers are paid the average wage.  
So, if  $w_{h} - w < c$ , there is still a pooling equilibrium.  
Recall that  $w = \theta \times w_{h} + (1 - \theta) \times w_{l}$ .

Without a degree, high-ability workers receive w. If they go to school, their net earnings is Wh-W. In a pooling equilibrium, the extra pay is less than the cost of schooling.

# Unique or Multiple Equilibria

Depending on differences in abilities, the cost of schooling, and the share of high-ability workers, only one type of equilibrium may be possible, or both may be possible.

# Parameters

$w_{h} = \$ 40,000$  
$w_{l} = \$  20,000$

For which  $c$  and  $\theta$  a separating equilibrium is possible?

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \binom {1 1} {5, 0 0 0} & \frac {1}{2} \\ 2 5, 0 0 0 \\ 1 5, 0 0 0 \end{array}
$$

# Efficiency

In our extreme example, high-ability people get an otherwise useless education solely to show that they differ from low-ability people. "Wasteful signaling"

□ Signaling changes the distribution of wages: instead of everyone getting the average wage, high-ability workers receive more pay than low-ability workers.

Everyone may be worse off in a separating equilibrium!

This inefficient cost on education is due to asymmetric information and the incentive of high-ability workers to signal their ability.

# Is Education Just Signaling?

The true answer is that the returns are likely a mix of a productivity boost and a signal value.  
□ Establishing casual relationship and estimating returns to education is a challenge to researchers.  
Many studies do show that there are returns to education.  
In one interesting study, Campaniello et al (2016) analyzed the earnings and assets of members of the Italian-American mafia from 1930-1960.  

- Mobsters enjoy high returns on education: educated mobsters were more likely to be involved in "complex crimes" such as embezzlement or bookmaking.

# PPHA 32400 (Winter 2023)

# Lecture 14: Signaling

Asymmetric information is frequently a problem in labor markets. Prospective employees may have less information about working conditions than firms do. Conversely, firms may have less information about potential employees' abilities than the workers do. We will focus on the latter.

Workers may signal to reduce the asymmetry in information about workers' abilities. Here, we consider situations in which workers have more information about their ability than firms do. We look first at inexpensive signals (i.e. cheap talk) sent by workers, and then at expensive signals (i.e. costly signal) sent by workers.

# Cheap Talk

Suppose that a firm plans to hire Cyndi to do one of two jobs - The demanding job requires someone with high ability; the undemanding job can be done better by someone of low ability since the job bores more able people, who then perform poorly.

Cyndi knows whether her ability level is high or low, but the firm is unsure. It initially thinks that either level is equally likely. Figure 1 shows the payoffs to Cyndi and the firm under various possibilities<sup>1</sup>.

# When Cheap Talk Works

Suppose that low quality workers get  $-3$  psychological damage from the demanding job  

- Cheap talk generates separating equilibrium!

WARNING: These are payoffs, not a 2x2 game

Cyndi's Ability

Job That Firm Gives to Cyndi  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Demanding</td><td>Undemanding</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>4,3</td><td>1,1</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>1,-1</td><td>2,2</td></tr></table>

Figure 1

- The payoff to the firm is greater if Cyndi is properly matched to the job: She is given the demanding job if she has high ability and the undemanding job if she has low ability. If Cyndi is mismatched, then the firm will receive lower payoff.  
- If Cyndi has high ability, she enjoys the demanding job: Her payoff is 4. She can handle the undemanding job but it bores her very much, so her payoff is only 1.  
- If Cyndi has low ability, she finds the demanding job too stressful - her payoff is only 1 - but she can handle the undemanding job and get a payoff of 2.

To send signal, Cyndi could make possible statements about her ability by saying either "My ability is high" or "My ability is low." The outcome is that Cyndi tells the truth and the firm, believing her, assigns her to the appropriate job. If she claims to have high ability, the firm gives her the demanding job and in the undemanding job otherwise. If the firm reacts to her cheap talk in this manner, Cyndi has no incentive to lie. If she did lie, the firm would make a mistake, which would be bad for both parties. The outcome is a separating equilibrium, as different ability levels lead to different types of jobs.

However, in many other situations, cheap talk does not work. Given the payoffs in Figure 2, Cyndi and the firm do not want the same outcomes. The firm still wants Cyndi in the demanding job if she has high ability and in the undemanding job otherwise. But Cyndi wants the demanding job regardless of her ability. So she claims to have high ability regardless of the truth. Knowing her incentives, the firm views her statement as meaningless babbling - her statement does not change the firm's view that her ability is equally likely to be high or low.

# When Cheap Talk Fails

Suppose that low-ability workers get  $-1$  from the demanding job.  

- Cheap talk generates pooling equilibrium!

WARNING: These are payoffs, not a 2x2 game

Cyndi's Ability

Job That Firm Gives to Cyndi  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Demanding</td><td>Undemanding</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>4,3</td><td>1,1</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>3,-1</td><td>2,2</td></tr></table>

Figure 2

Given that belief, the firm gives her the undemanding job, for which its expected payoff is higher. The firm's expected payoff is  $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1.5$  if it gives her the undemanding job and  $\frac{1}{2} \times 3 + \frac{1}{2} \times (-1) = 1$  if it assigns her to the demanding job. Thus, the outcome is a pooling equilibrium, as the firm will assign Cyndi the same (undemanding) job regardless of her true ability.

# Costly Signal: Education

When the interests of the firm and the individual diverge, cheap talk does not provide a credible signal. Here an individual has to send a more expensive signal to be believed. We now examine such a signal.

Going to college may get you a better job because you obtain valuable training. Another possibility is that a college degree may land you a good job because it serves as a signal to employers about your ability. If high-ability people are more likely to go to college than low-ability people, schooling signals ability to employers (Spence, 1974).

To illustrate how such signaling works, we'll make the extreme assumptions that graduating from an appropriate school serves as the signal only and that schooling provides no training that is useful to firms (Stiglitz, 1975). High-ability workers are  $\theta$  share of the workforce, and low-ability workers are  $1 - \theta$  share. The value of output that a high-ability worker produces for a firm is worth  $w_{h}$ , and that of a low-ability worker is  $w_{l}$ .

Two types of equilibria are possible, depending on whether or not employers can distinguish high-ability workers from others. If employers have no way of telling workers apart, the outcome is a pooling equilibrium: Dissimilar people are treated (paid) alike. Employers pay all workers the average wage:

$$
w = \theta \times w _ {h} + (1 - \theta) \times w _ {l}
$$

We assume that high-ability individuals can get a degree by spending  $c$  to get a degree and that low-ability people cannot graduate from the school. If high-ability people graduate and low-ability people do not, a degree is a signal of ability to employers. Given such a clear signal, the outcome is a separating equilibrium. Here a successful signal causes high-ability workers to receive  $w_{h}$  and the others to receive  $w_{l}$ , so wages vary with ability.

# Condition for a Separating Equilibrium

In a separating equilibrium, high-ability people pay  $c$  to get a degree and are employed at a wage of  $w_{h}$ , while low-ability individuals do not get a degree and work for a wage of  $w_{l}$ . The low-ability people have no choice, as they cannot get a degree. High-ability individuals have the option of not going to school. Without a degree, however, they are viewed as low ability once hired, and they receive  $w_{l}$ . If they go to school, their net earnings are  $w_{h} - c$ . Thus, it pays for a high-ability person to go to school if

$$
w _ {h} - c > w _ {l} \Leftrightarrow w _ {h} - w _ {l} > c.
$$

The inequality above says that the benefit from graduating, the extra pay  $w_{h} - w_{l}$ , exceeds the cost of schooling. Thus, if the inequality holds, no worker wants to change behavior, so a separating equilibrium is feasible.

# Condition for a Pooling Equilibrium

In a pooling equilibrium, all workers are paid the average wage,  $w$ . Again, because low-ability people cannot graduate, they have no choice. A high-ability person must choose whether or not to go to school. Without a degree, that individual is paid the average wage. With a degree, the worker is paid  $w_{h}$ . It does not pay for the high-ability person to graduate if the benefit from graduating, the extra pay  $w_{h} - w$ ,

is less than the cost of schooling:

$$
w _ {h} - w <   c.
$$

Thus, if the inequality holds, no worker wants to change behavior, so a pooling equilibrium persists.

# Unique or Multiple Equilibria

Depending on differences in abilities, the cost of schooling, and the share of high-ability workers, only one type of equilibrium may be possible or both may be possible. For example, suppose that  $\theta = \frac{1}{2}$ ,  $w_{h} = 40,000$  and  $w_{l} = 20,000$  and hence  $w = \frac{1}{2} \times 40,000 + \frac{1}{2} \times 20,000 = 30,000$ . Let's consider the following three scenarios:

- $c = 5,000$ : Since  $w_{h} - w_{l} > c$ , a separating equilibrium exists – If cost of schooling is low enough such that the extra pay from getting a degree can justify this cost, high-ability workers will have incentives to go to school.  
- $c = 25,000$ : Since  $w_h - w < c$ , a pooling equilibrium exists – If cost of schooling is so high such that the extra pay from getting a degree cannot justify this cost, high-ability workers will have no incentive to go to school and would rather receive the average pay.  
- $c = 15,000$ : Since both  $w_{h} - w_{l} > c$  and  $w_{h} - w < c$  hold, both a separating equilibrium and a pooling equilibrium are possible – In the pooling equilibrium, no one wants to change behavior, so this equilibrium is possible. Similarly, no one wants to change behavior in a separating equilibrium. Then, which one would be the final outcome? Theoretically, either equilibrium would exist, but we don't know which one is more likely to occur without further information and context provided. However, say the government subsidizes schooling for some high-ability workers. Once some individuals start to signal, so that firms know who is who and hence pay either a low or high wage (instead of a pooling wage), it pays for other high-ability people to signal. In this case, a pooling equilibrium is unlikely to be stable, and it is more likely that a separating equilibrium persists.

# Efficiency

In the case of a separating equilibrium, high ability people get an otherwise useless education solely to show that they differ from low-ability people. An education is privately useful to the high-ability workers if it serves as a signal that gets them higher net pay. In our extreme example, however, education is socially inefficient because it is costly and provides no useful training.

Signaling changes the distribution of wages: Instead of everyone getting the average wage, high-ability workers receive more pay than low-ability workers. Nonetheless, everyone may be worse off in a separating equilibrium. In the case when  $c = 15,000$ , either a pooling equilibrium or a separating equilibrium is possible. In the pooling equilibrium, each worker is paid  $w = 30,000$  and no wasteful signaling occurs. In the separating equilibrium, high-ability workers make  $w_{h} - c = 25,000$  and low-ability workers make  $w_{l} = 20,000 \Rightarrow$  High-ability people earn less in the separating equilibrium than they would in a pooling equilibrium! Nonetheless, if anyone signals, eventually all high-ability workers will want to send a signal to prevent their wage from falling to that of a low-ability worker.

In reality, some signaling like education is still socially efficient because it increases total output, as this signal results in a better matching of workers and jobs and/or because it provides useful training as well as serving as a signal. So it's still highly suggested to finish your study at UChicago Harris!

# Plan

The problem of moral hazard  
Moral hazard in financial markets  
Contract theory

# Moral Hazard

# Problems Due to Asymmetric Information

Adverse selection occurs when one party to a transaction possesses information about a hidden characteristic that is unknown to other parties.  
Moral hazard is the problem that the informed party might take actions that the other party cannot observe and that harms the less-informed party.

# Moral Hazard

Moral hazard arises when one party to a transaction cannot observe the other party's behavior.  
□ For example, money managers handling clients' funds have moral hazard. In general, when quality is difficult to observe, a party to a transaction may have a financial incentive to engage in fraud.  
In insurance markets, adverse selection refers to the problem of deciding who to insure and at what price. In contrast, moral hazard refers to the effect of being insured on the behavior of an individual.  
□ Knowing you are insured may make you more willing to take risks, since part of your risk is being borne by a third party.

# Moral Hazard: An Example

Suppose that you own a $500 bicycle.  
Probability that it will be stolen if you don't lock it is  $10\%$ .  
Probability that it will be stolen if you lock it is  $1 \%$ .  
Cost of locking it is $8.

Would you lock your bike?  
□ Yes! The expected loss if locked is  $0.01 \times \$ 500 + \ $8 = \$13$ ; the expected loss if not locked is  $50. (= 10\% \times \$500)$  
What if the bike was fully insured?  
□ No! The expected loss if locked is $8; the expected loss if not locked is 0.

# Bicycle Insurance

No insurance – you bear the entire risk and will lock the bike.  
Full insurance – you bear no risk and won't lock the bike.

The insurance company would like you to always lock.  
□ You can promise them you will, but it's impossible to check.  
Moral hazard refers to the lack of incentive to guard against a risk when one is protected from its consequences.

# Moral Hazard

Moral hazard rises in insurance markets with the following features:

An agent is protected against risky outcomes.  
□ Agents can take actions to reduce the risk.  
The insurer cannot verify these actions.

Result: protection against certain types of risk don't exist.  
An example: risky business ventures.  
The missing insurance is a deadweight loss.

# A Solution: Partial Insurance

The insurance company imposes a $100 deductible.  
□ If your  $500 bike gets stolen, company will pay$ 400.  
Will you lock your bike now?  
□ Yes, since the expected loss when locked is \(0.01 \times \\)100 + \\(8 = \$9,\( whereas the expected loss if not locked is \(0.1 \times \\)100 = \$10.\)

# Lessening Moral Hazard: Monitoring

Market mechanisms have developed to diminish the effects of moral hazard.  
■ Insurance policies often mandate actions to be taken by the insured.

□ Commercial property insurance often requires working smoke detectors and regularly inspected fire extinguishers.  
Home insurance companies might require installing fire alarms, smoke detectors, security cameras, etc.  
They inspectors to verify that these actions have been taken properly.

# Lessening Moral Hazard: Incentives

■ Policies can be structured to encourage good behavior.

Some auto insurance deductibles fall after each accident-free year.  
Life insurance premiums usually fall when efforts are made to improve health (e.g., quit smoking).  
□ Health insurance might include rebates for gym membership.  
Homeowners get a rebate for installing locks.  
Premiums may be tied to frequency of claims.

# Moral Hazard in Financial Markets

# Remember Bank Runs?

Bank runs are an inherent feature of the main function of the banking system, maturity transformation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/e9468982af93587d8bd5d0e95cb11efe5b4fcce371f885b06c38f30137472a69.jpg)

During the Great Depression (1929-1939) nearly a third of all banks failed, which contributed to the duration and depth of the crisis.  
In 1933, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was established, initially insuring deposits of up to $2,500.  
Deposit insurance protects depositors from losses caused by a bank's inability to pay its debts.

The number of bank failures fell to nearly zero.  
□ Currently, it collects "premiums" of around  $0.015 \%$ to  $0.4 \%$ and insures deposits of up to $250,000.  
Deposit insurance is now an international norm.

# Deposit Insurance: Moral Hazard

There is a downside to the deposit insurance: depositors no longer pay attention to what their banks do.

If the bank does well, the depositors earn interest.  
□ If the bank does poorly, the depositors get their money back from FDIC.

Banks are regulated in what they could do by FDIC and other financial regulators.

For example, the Glass-Steagall Act required separating investment and commercial banking activities to reduce the riskiness of banks' investments.

# S&L History

Savings and Loan Associations (S&L) were organizations that collected savings deposits and issued mortgages, car loans, and other personal loans.

Essentially, banks doing maturity transformation.  
In the 1970s, inflation rose, and S&Ls were hurt – they issued a lot of fixed-rate loans.  
The federal government deregulated them to help recovery.

For example, the government let them issue floating-interest-rate loans.  
□ Also, deregulation allowed them to invest in risky commercial loans such as real estate projects.

# S&LCrisis

S&Ls were assessed by the FDIC as if they were making safe loans.  
As a result, deposit insurance was underpriced.  
Many such firms failed in the 1980s. By one estimate, these failures costed FDIC $200 billion.

# Another Moral Hazard Issue in S&L Crisis

Another common instance of moral hazard occurs between borrowers and lenders in financial markets.

- Borrowers' liability may be limited (e.g., in bankruptcy proceedings), meaning they may be willing to take unjustified risks with borrowed funds.  
□ Implicit guarantees to large financial institutions may increase risk taking.  
If you owe the bank $100, that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem." - J. Principal Getty (attributed).  
Some organizations are "too big to fail" – letting them collapse risks substantial harm to other organizations.  
If the organizations (and their shareholders) know this, they'll take excessive risks, knowing that they'll be bailed out if things go sour.

# The 2008-09 Financial Crisis

The 2008-09 financial crisis brought the issue of "too big to fail" to the forefront of the public discussion.  
In March 2008, the regulators helped negotiating the last-minute sale of the investment bank Bear Sterns.  
In September 2008, the regulators did not intervene – not willing to encourage moral hazard – and the investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

In March – September, the Lehman Brothers managers continued with their risky strategy, apparently counting on a possible last-minute bailout.  

- Immediately following the Lehman Brothers collapse, the government once again intervened to bailout AIG, the world-largest insurance company…

# The Cost of Moral Hazard

A Center for Economic and Policy Research estimates show an indirect "too big to fail" subsidy of  $34 billion per year to the 18 U.S. banks with more than$ 100 billion in assets.

The research looked at the difference between the cost of funds for banks with more than $100 billion in assets (that had an implicit guarantee because they were “too big to fail”) and the cost of funds for smaller banks.  
By a Bloomberg View's estimate, the "too big to fail banks" had a funding advantage of 0.8 percentage points, which amounted to \(83 billion annual subsidy to the 10 largest US banks.  
Another reliable study estimated the implicit subsidy at $120 billion from 2007 to 2010.

# Alleviating Moral Hazard

In July 2010, the Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a major overhaul of the US financial regulation, with the goal to prevent the excessive risk-taking that led to the 2008-09 financial crisis.

The Dodd-Frank Act provided financial regulators with additional authority to oversee the health of the financial system, monitor and regulate banks and protect their consumers.

□ In particular, the regulators have authority to break up financial institutions that they would consider "too big to fail" in the instance of a crisis.  
The 2016 reform pursued by the Trump administration reduced the regulatory power of different agencies, while leaving in place the core.  
While most economists agree that the Dodd-Frank reform made the financial system more stable, some are concerned by the burden that it imposes on the economy.

# The Principal-Agent Problem

# Principals and Agents

Moral hazard is ubiquitous in firm-employee relationships.  
In economics, the field that focuses on moral hazard in firm-employee relationships is called "Theory of a firm" or "Contract theory" or simply "Principal-agent problem".

Principal needs to design a contract that provides the agent with incentives to work hard so as to achieve production efficiency and reduce (or eliminate) moral hazard issues.

# The Principal-Agent Problem: An Example

In our story Principal owns many ice cream parlors across North America.  
Principal contracts with Agent to manage his Miami shop. Her duties include supervising workers, purchasing supplies, and performing other necessary actions.  
The shop's daily earnings depend on two things:

on the local demand conditions;  
on how hard Agent works.  
Demand for ice cream varies with the weather, and is high half the time, and low otherwise.

# The Setup

Owner's payoffs depend on efforts and weather.  
■ Agent's extra efforts cost 100 to her.

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Weather</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Agent&#x27;s efforts</td><td>Bad</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>High (costs Agent 100)</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>50% chance</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>50% chance</td></tr></table>

# Efficiency Concerns

(Pareto) efficient contract – a contract, in which neither party can be made better off without harming the other party.  
■ Efficiency (in production) – outcome in which the principal's and agent's combined value (profits, payoffs) is maximized.  
■ Efficiency in risk bearing – a situation in which risk sharing is optimal in that the person who least minds facing risk – the risk-neutral or less risk-averse person – bears more of the risk.  
In our example, Principal is risk-neutral, while Agent is risk-averse.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/0d181f35fc4b0fbfd9c36a36edfa25655ef8f17078cadd514911ae0987f51cbb.jpg)

# Symmetric Information

Agent's efforts

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bad</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>High (costs Agent 100)</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr></table>

50% chance 50% chance

Moral hazard is not a problem if Principal lives in Miami and can directly supervise Agent.

□ Contract specifies Agent receives \(200 per day if she works extra hard, but loses her job if she does not.  
□ Agent bears no risk: $200 regardless of demand conditions;  
Principal is the residual claimant: he receives the revenue minus Agent's wage.

Agent chooses to work hard.  
Expected payoffs:

□ Agent  $200 -$ 100 = $100.  
Principal: \(0.5 \times \\)1,000 + 0.5 \times \\(1,500 - \\)200 = \$1,050.\)

The contract is efficient because Principal, the risk-neutral party, bears all the risk, and their combined earnings are as high as possible because Agent works, in equilibrium, extra hard.

# Fixed-Fee Contracts

Agent's efforts

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bad</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>High (costs Agent 100)</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr></table>

50% chance 50% chance

A fixed-fee contract – one party pays the other a constant fee.  
Principal pays agent:

- Agent receives the same wage no matter how hard she works.
- Say, \(300 per day of work.

Agent chooses not to work hard, which is a moral hazard problem.  
Expected payoffs:

Agent $300.  
Principal: \(0.5 \times \\)500 + 0.5 \times \\(1,000 - \\)300 = \$450.\)  
The expected combined earnings ( $750) are less than with symmetric information$ (1,050) – that is, the outcome is inefficient.  
Principal bears all the risk, so risk bearing is again efficient.

# Fixed-Fee Contracts

Agent's efforts

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bad</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>High (costs Agent 100)</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr></table>

50% chance 50% chance

Again, a fixed-fee contract - one party pays the other a constant fee.  
Yet now the agent pays the principal:

□ Agent pays the Principal a licensing fee.  
 Say, $600 per day.

Now, Agent chooses to work hard, so moral hazard is not a problem.  
Expected payoffs:

□ Agent  $0.5 \times ($ 1,000 - $600) + 0.5 × ($1,500 - $600) - $100 = $550.  
Principal: $600.

The expected combined earnings are the same as with symmetric information – that is, the outcome is efficient.  
Agent who is risk-averse bears all the risk, so risk bearing is not efficient.

# State-Contingent Contracts

Agent's efforts

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bad</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>High (costs Agent 100)</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr></table>

50% chance 50% chance

State-contingent contracts - one party's payoff is contingent on the state of nature.  
Nature:  $\rightarrow$  e.g. profits Such contract should be contingent on something that is observable and verifiable.  
Suppose Agent pays Principal a licensing fee of  $300 if demand is low and a license fee of$ 500 if demand is high and keeps any additional earnings.  
Agent chooses to work hard.  
Expected payoffs:

□ Agent:  $0.5 \times ($ 1,000 - $300) + 0.5 × ($1,500 - $500) - $100 = $750.  
Principal: \(0.5 \times \\)300 + 0.5 \times \$500 = \$400.\)

This state-contingent contract is efficient even if Principal cannot monitor Agent's effort.  
However, Agent bears some risk which is not efficient.

# Profit-Sharing Contracts

Agent's efforts

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bad</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>High (costs Agent 100)</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr></table>

50% chance 50% chance

Profit-sharing contracts are contracts, in which the payoff to each party is a fraction of the observable total profit.  
Profit sharing may reduce the moral hazard, especially if the agent's share of the profit is large, but may not do so if the agent's share is small.  
Consider  $50\%$  profit sharing.  
Expected payoffs:

□ Agent: \(0.5 \times (0.5 \times \\)1,000 + 0.5 \times \$1,500) - \$100 = \$525\) if Agent works hard.  
□ Agent: \(0.5 \times (0.5 \times \\)500 + 0.5 \times \$1000) = \$375\) if Agent does not work hard.

□ Agent works hard and Principal gets \(0.5 \times (0.5 \times \\)1,000 + 0.5 \times \$1,500) = \$625.\)

Production is efficient, but risk-sharing is not.  
Exercise: what happens if Agent has  $20 \%$ share? She'll be indifferent.

# Lecture 15: Principal-Agent Problem (Contract Theory)

Moral hazard in a principal-agent relationship is referred to as a principal-agent problem. If information is symmetric so that actions cannot be hidden, principal-agent relationships do not give rise to a moral hazard problem. However, if information is asymmetric so that actions cannot be observed, then an agent may take advantage of the principal.

To illustrate the principal-agent problem, we consider an example where the payoffs to the owner of a firm (the principal) and the manager (the agent) depend on the agent's actions and the state of nature, such as weather (which affects demand). The principal and the agent care about how payoffs are allocated and how the risk is shared.

Principal owns many ice cream parlors across North America. He contracts with Agent to manage his Miami shop. Her duties include supervising workers, purchasing supplies, and performing other necessary actions. The shop's daily earnings depend on the local demand conditions and on how hard Agent works. Demand for ice cream varies with the weather, and is high half the time, and low otherwise. Agent puts forth either low or high effort. However, extra work is tiring and prevents Agent from spending time at the beach with friends, watching YouTube or Netflix videos, and engaging in other activities that she enjoys. She values her personal cost of this extra effort at $100 per day.

For any given level of demand, the shop sells more ice cream if Agent puts forth extra effort. The shop also sells more for a given level of Agent's effort if demand is high. The profit of the ice cream shop before Agent is paid – the combined payoff to Principal and Agent – for the four possible combinations of effort and demand are shown in Figure 1. We will consider the following six different contracts and examine which of them are efficient in production and/or efficient in risk bearing.

# The Setup

Owner's payoffs depend on efforts and weather.  
■ Agent's extra efforts cost 100 to her.

Figure 1

# I. Symmetric Information

Consider the situation of Symmetric Information - Moral hazard is not a problem if Principal lives in Miami and can directly supervise Agent. Say they could agree to a contract that specifies Agent receives a wage of $200 per day if she exerts high effort regardless of the weather conditions, but loses her job if she doesn't. What is Agent's net payoff? Principal's expected payoff? Is the contract efficient in risk bearing?

Agent will choose to work extra hard and get $200 per day regardless of the weather, which is better than being fired and getting nothing. So her net payoff is $200 - $100 = $200.

Principal, as a residual claimant, receives the residual payoff, which is the amount left over from the store's payoff after Agent's wage is paid. His residual payoff varies with demand:

- If demand is low, the shop earns $1,000, he pays Agent $200, and retains $800.  
- If demand is high, the shop earns  $1,500, so he keeps$ 1,300 after paying Agent $200.

Hence, Principal's expected payoff is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \$ 8 0 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 1, 3 0 0 = \$ 1, 0 5 0.
$$

The contract is efficient in risk bearing because Principal, the risk-neutral party, bears all the risk from the shop's uncertain earnings, whereas Agent received a guaranteed (i.e. risk-free) earnings. Note that the contract is also efficient in production because their combined earnings, $1,150, are as high as possible since Agent works extra hard.

# II. Asymmetric Information: Fixed-Fee Contracts

Principal grows tired of warm weather and moves from Miami to Chicago, where he can no longer observe Agent's effort. Because Agent's effort is now a hidden action to Principal, he faces a moral hazard problem. When Principal could monitor Agent's effort, he could make her wage contingent on hard work. Now, he pays her a wage that does not vary with her (hidden) effort.

Suppose Principal and Agent's contract specifies that Principal pays Agent a fixed wage of $300 regardless of how much profit the shop earns. Such a contract is a special case of a fixed-fee contract, in which one party pays the other a constant payment.

Because Agent receives the same amount no matter how hard she works, Agent chooses to put low effort and get a net payoff of $300, which is a moral hazard problem. Reason: if she works with low effort, she incurs no additional personal cost from extra effort and receives $300. On the other hand, if she provides extra effort, she still receives a wage of $300 but incurs a personal cost of $100, so her net payoff is only $200.

Principal, as a residual claimant, receives the residual payoff, which is the amount left over from the store's payoff after Agent's wage is paid. His residual payoff varies with demand:

- If demand is low, the shop earns $500, he pays Agent $300, and retains $200.  
 - If demand is high, the shop earns $1,000, so he keeps $700 after paying Agent $300.

Hence, Principal's expected payoff is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \$ 2 0 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 7 0 0 = \$ 4 5 0.
$$

The contract is efficient in risk bearing because Principal, the risk-neutral party, bears all the risk from the shop's uncertain earnings, whereas Agent received a guaranteed (i.e. risk-free) earnings. Note that the contract is not efficient in production because their combined earnings,  $\\(750$ , are less than those with symmetric information, \)1,150. Because the moral hazard substantially reduces the shop's expected earnings, having Principal pay Agent a fixed wage is not the best way to compensate her.

# III. Asymmetric Information: License-Fee Contracts

A well-designed contract that provides the agent with strong incentives to act so as to achieve production efficiency may reduce or eliminate moral hazard problems.

We initially considered a fixed-fee contract in which Principal pays Agent a fixed wage, with the result that Principal bears all of the risk and Agent bears none. Alternatively, Agent could pay Principal a fixed amount so that she receives the residual profit: the profit left over after Principal has been paid his fixed payoff. Agent is, in effect, paying a license fee to operate Principal's ice cream shop. With such a contract, as we will see, Principal bears no risk as he receives a fixed fee, while Agent bears all the risk.

Principal will receive  $600 regardless of the weather. As Agent receives the residual profit under such a licensing contract, she receives all the increase in expected profit from her extra effort. She is therefore motivated to work hard. To illustrate why, we suppose that Agent pays Principal a fixed licensing fee of$ 600 per day and keeps any residual profit:

- If she works with low effort, she incurs no additional personal cost from extra effort and receives -$100 or $400, depending on the weather, so her expected payoff is 0.5×(-$100)+0.5×$400 = $150.  
 - If she provides extra effort, she receives a wage of $400 or $900 but incurs a personal cost of $100, so her net expected payoff is 0.5 × $(400 - 100) + 0.5 × $(900 - 100) = $550.

As you can verify, Agent's variance in earnings is  $0.5 \times (-100 - 150)^2 + 0.5 \times (400 - 150)^2 = 31,250$  with low effort, which is the same as the variance with high effort,  $0.5 \times (300 - 550)^2 + 0.5 \times (900 - 550)^2$ . Thus, because her risk is the same with both levels of effort but her net expected payoffs are higher if she puts forth high effort, it is in her best interest to work hard.

In summary, although Agent paying Principal rather than the other way around increases their total payoffs, it makes the risk-averse person, Agent, bear all the risk, while Principal, the risk-neutral person, bears no risk. Therefore, although this contract achieves efficiency in production, it does not provide for efficient risk bearing.

# IV. Asymmetric Information: State-Contingent Contracts

Many contracts specify that the parties receive payoffs that are contingent on some other variable, such as the action taken by the agent, the state of nature, or the firm's output or profit. Contingent contracts may be used even when monitoring is not feasible.

Now consider a state-contingent contract – one party's payoff is contingent on only the state of nature. Suppose Agent pays Principal a license fee of  $300 if demand is low and a license fee of$ 500 if demand is high and keeps any additional earnings.

As the residual claimant, Agent has an incentive to provide high effort<sup>1</sup>. Her residual payoff varies with demand:

- If demand is low, the shop earns  $1,000, she pays Principal$ 300, and retains $700.  
- If demand is high, the shop earns  $1,500, so she keeps$ 1,000 after paying Principal $500.

Hence, Agent's net expected payoff is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \\( (7 0 0 - 1 0 0) + \frac {1}{2} \times \\) (1, 0 0 0 - 1 0 0) = \\) 7 5 0.
$$

Principal's expected payoff is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \$ 3 0 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 6 0 0 = \$ 4 5 0.
$$

Although Agent paying Principal rather than the other way around increases their total payoffs, it makes both Agent and Principal bear some of the risk. Therefore, although this contract achieves efficiency in production, it does not provide for efficient risk bearing.

# V. Asymmetric Information: Profit-Sharing Contracts

One common contingent contract is a profit-sharing contract, in which the payoff to each party is a fraction of the observable total profit. Suppose that Principal and Agent agree to split the earnings of the ice cream shop equally. Does making Agent's pay contingent on the firm's earnings induce Agent to work hard?

If Agent exerts low effort, the shop earns $500 if the demand is low and Agent receives 50%, or $250. If demand is high, the shop earns $1,000, so Agent's share is $500 (= 50% × $1,000). Thus, Agent's expected payoff from low effort is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \$ 2 5 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 5 0 0 = \$ 3 7 5.
$$

If Agent provides extra effort, the shop earns $1,000 if the demand is low, and Agent receives $500, but she incurs a personal cost of $100 for providing high effort, so her net return is $400. If the demand is high, the shop's profit is $1,500, so that Agent nets $650 (= 50% × $1,500 - $100). Thus, Agent's net expected payoff from high effort is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \$ 4 0 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 6 5 0 = \$ 5 2 5.
$$

As you can verify, Agent's variance in earnings is  $0.5 \times (250 - 375)^2 + 0.5 \times (500 - 375)^2 = 15,625$  with low effort, which is the same as the variance with high effort,  $0.5 \times (400 - 525)^2 + 0.5 \times (650 - 525)^2$ . Thus, because her risk is the same with both levels of effort but her net expected payoffs are higher if

she puts forth high effort, it is in her best interest to work hard.

Hence, Principal's expected payoff is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times (50 \% \times \$ 1,000) + \frac {1}{2} \times (50 \% \times \$ 1,500) = \$ 625.
$$

In summary, although this profit-sharing contract increases their total payoffs, it makes both Agent and Principal bear some of the risk. Therefore, although this contract achieves efficiency in production, it does not provide for efficient risk bearing.

Note: Agent chooses to work harder only if she gets a large enough share of the profit to offset her personal cost from doing the extra work. Thus, profit sharing may reduce or eliminate the moral hazard problem, especially if the agent's share of the profit is large, but may not do so if the agent's share is small. Exercise: what happens if Agent only has  $20\%$  share instead of  $50\%$ ? Less than  $20\%$ ?

# VI. Asymmetric Information: Bonuses

To induce an agent to work hard, a principal may offer the agent a bonus: an extra payment if a performance target is hit. For example, Principal could offer Agent a base wage of $200 and a bonus of $300 if the shop's earnings (before paying Agent) exceed $1,200. Does the bonus induce Agent to work hard?

If Agent provides low effort, the shop does not earn enough to trigger the bonus, so Agent receives $200 in both states of nature. If Agent provides extra effort but the demand is low, the shop earns $1,000 (not enough to trigger the bonus), so Agent receives her wage of $200 and incurs a cost of $100, so her net payoff is $100. However, if she works hard and the demand is high, the shop earns $1,500, the bonus is triggered, and Agent gets her wage of $200 plus the bonus of $300. After subtracting her cost of extra effort, she nets $200 + $300 - $100 = $400. Thus, Agent's net expected payoff with extra effort is

$$
\frac {1}{2} \times \$ 1 0 0 + \frac {1}{2} \times \$ 4 0 0 = \$ 2 5 0,
$$

which exceeds the $200 she earns with low effort. However, the variance in her net expected payoff with extra effort is  $0.5 \times (100 - 250)^2 + 0.5 \times (400 - 250)^2 = 22,500 > 0$ . Thus, whether Agent chooses to work extra hard depends on how risk averse she is. If she is not very risk averse, she may work extra hard. However, if she is very risk averse, she puts in only low effort, receives a modest but predictable wage, and avoids the risk of sometimes earning little.

- If Agent puts low effort, Principal's expected payoff is $550. The outcome is efficient in risk bearing, but not efficient in production.  
- If Agent puts high effort, Principal's expected payoff is $900. The outcome is efficient in production, but not efficient in risk bearing.

The outcome of each contract is summarized in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Contract</td><td colspan="3">Expected Payoffs</td><td colspan="2">Efficiency</td></tr><tr><td>Principal</td><td>Agent</td><td>Total</td><td>Risk Bearing</td><td>Production</td></tr><tr><td>①</td><td>1050</td><td>100</td><td>1150</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>②</td><td>450</td><td>300</td><td>750</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>③</td><td>600</td><td>550</td><td>1150</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>④</td><td>400</td><td>750</td><td>1150</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>⑤</td><td>625</td><td>525</td><td>1150</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">⑥</td><td>900</td><td>250</td><td>1150</td><td>no</td><td>yes (if Agent is not very risk-averse)</td></tr><tr><td>550</td><td>200</td><td>750</td><td>yes</td><td>no (if Agent is very risk-averse)</td></tr></table>

# Auctions

■ Auction – a sale in which the object, a property or a service, is sold to the highest bidder.  
study of auctions is the core of the modern economic theory.

Two key components:

a degree of uniqueness to the sale;  
strategic interaction within defined rules.

Two main goals:

Revenue;  
□ Efficiency.

# Auctioning Seats

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/20c2544a-d094-4d88-b7b4-3fd50098ec8a/0c84a623e90db98697f3382b782cbb2996b2ea48b3f6c558a70be6c2f79cb942.jpg)

Airlines oversell some flights.  
Then, organize an auction, in which those who have seats can sell them to those who do not.  
Everyone is better off:

airlines;  
those who bought tickets with seats;  
those who want to get a seat at the last minute.

# An Auction

Important elements

the number of units being sold  
the format of the bidding

Participants

□ auctioneer (representing the seller)  
buyers (bidders)  
□ potential buyers

The key element

□ imperfect information

# Auction as a Game

Any strategic game has

□ players  
strategies  
payoffs

To model auctions, one needs to introduce imperfect information

bidders do not know how valuable is the object to other bidders  
□ auctioneer does not know how valuable is the object to bidders

# Information

In our auction model, a type of a bidder is the value that this bidder attaches to the object, the reservation price.  
Bidders have private values if each bidder knows the value of the object for herself and does not know the value of the object for other bidders.  
as in previous lectures, "does not know" = "has a probability distribution"

supplement

Bidders have common values if the object brings the same value to each bidder, but they do not know this value.

# Different Auction Formats

# English Auction

The auctioneer starts the bidding at some low price and then repeatedly encourages potential buyers to bid more than the previous highest bidder.

the starting price should be acceptable to the seller  
the auction step (difference between possible bids) should be appropriate

In Japan, English auction is organized as follows

price is rising continuously (on a big screen)  
each bidder might drop at any moment  
when the second-to-last bidder drops, the price clock stops  
the last remaining bidder pays the price

# Optimal Strategy in English Auction

The optimal strategy in English auction is to bid until the price reaches your value.  
this is a dominant strategy – no need to pay attention to what other bidders do.  
■ Very simple (no "strategy" needed)! Just bid your value! often used to sell art, wine, antiques, and other luxurious goods

# Winner's Curse

[the only time we focus on common values]  
■ English auction allows people to update information  
Suppose that

the ultimate value of the object to the bidders is the same  
initially, they do not know this value, but have a signal/estimation about it

E.g., oil field  $\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \$ 10 \\ \$ 30 \\ \$ 50 \end{array} \right.$  ; a jar of pennies  
■ Is it really a good news that you won the auction?

The winner is the one who tends to overestimate the value of the good the most, especially when there are many bidders!

# Collusion

Open-bid auctions are vulnerable to collusions  
Collusion is easier when

number of bidders is small  
bidders repeatedly participate in auctions  
□ information exchange between bidders is easy

# Noncooperative Collusion

Cellular companies participating in 1996 US spectrum auctions

Table 1: Example of Code Bidding

Collusion: to include license area codes in the last three digits of bids.

USWest was meant to tell its competitor to stay out of the Rochester market, known as license area 378.

# First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

Bidders submit their bids in sealed envelopes, then  
□ auctioneer opens the envelope and chooses the highest bid;  
the bidder that submitted the highest bid gets the object;  
the bidder that submitted the highest bid pays his bid.  
Since information isn't revealed, collusion becomes harder!

often used to sell real estates and some government contracts (e.g., buying raw materials)

# First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

Downside: bidders have to be strategic  
□ Bidding your true valuation means that you earn zero surplus  
They "shade down" their bids

If valuations are drawn from a uniform distribution, and there are 2 players, you should bid half your valuation

□ With  $n$  players, bid  $(n - 1)v/n$  where  $v$  is your valuation  

- Gets more complex with more players, risk aversion, inexperienced players etc

Prevents collusion but can result in inefficient allocation and

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {s c a r e o f f l e s s s a v y p l a y e r s} \\ \mathrm {e x p e c t e d p a y o f f = p r (w i n) \times (v - b)} \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \mathrm {I f} b \uparrow : & \uparrow \\ \mathrm {I f} b \downarrow : & \downarrow \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c} \downarrow \\ \uparrow \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \text {T r a d e - o f f !} \\ \text {P P H A 3 2 4 0 0 W i n t e r 2 0 2 3 | L e c t u r e 1 6} \end{array}
$$

# Dutch Auction

The seller starts by asking if anyone wants to buy at a relatively high price and then reduces the price until someone accepts.

winner pays the price at which the auction stopped  
strategy ends up being the same as in first-price sealed-bid auction  
even though it's open-bid!

It takes relatively little time, since a sale never requires more than one bid.

Often used in places such as flower markets and fish markets in Holland (hence the name "Dutch").

The U.S. Treasury uses it to sell most of the treasury bills and bonds.

# Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

Bidders submit their bids in sealed envelopes  
□ auctioneer opens the envelope and chooses the highest bid  
the bidder that submitted the highest bid gets the object  
the bidder that submitted the highest bid pays the second-highest bid

Claim: no need to be strategic!  
■ Bid your true value

Sometimes used to sell art, furniture and antiques as well (e.g., Sotheby's, Christie's)

# Proof (not in course)

Let  $i$ 's valuation be  $v_{i}$  and their bid be  $b_{i}$ .  
Let  $B$  be the maximum bid from all other players  
Payoff is  $v_{i} - B$  if  $b_{i} > B$  and 0 otherwise  
■ Overbidding  $b_{i} > v_{i}$  is not optimal

□ If  $b_{i} > v_{i} > B$ ,  $i$  would win anyway and payoff would be the same whether they bid  $b_{i}$  or  $v_{i}$  
□ If  $b_{i} > B > v_{i}, i$  would lose anyway  
If  $B > b_{i} > v_{i}, i$  would win and end up paying more than their valuation

# Proof (not in course)

Underbidding  $v_{i} > b_{i}$  is not optimal.  
□ If  $v_{i} > b_{i} > B$ ,  $i$  would win anyway and payoff would be the same whether they bid  $b_{i}$  or  $v_{i}$  
□ If  $v_{i} > B > b_{i}, i$  would lose an item they could have won!  
If  $B > v_{i} > b_{i}, i$  would lose anyway  
Conclusion: the optimal strategy is to bid  $v_{i} = b_{i}$

# Equilibrium in Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

In a sealed-bid second-price auction, bidding your value weakly dominates all other bidding strategies:

The strategy of bidding your maximum value leaves you as well off as, or better off than, bidding any other value.

When a bidder submits a bid in the eBay auction, the current "going" price is not the highest bid, but the second-highest bid plus a bid increment.

# 130 Years Ago

# William P. Brown, New York City, 1878

That out-of-town collectors may have equal facilities for purchasing with city collectors, bids may be sent to the auctioneers, Messrs. Bangs & Co., or to William Erving, P.O. Box 3222, N.Y. City, who will either of them represent their bids the same as though they were personally present, and without charge.

Thus, supposing either of these parties receives two bids on one lot of 20 and 25 cents apiece, they would start the lot at 21 cents, at which price it would be given to the person sending the 25-cent order, unless someone present advanced, when they would continue to bid, stopping at the limit of 25 cents.

Collectors can safely entrust these parties with their bids as strictly confidential, and we trust they will find it more satisfactory than paying the usual dealers' commission of ten per cent for purchasing. Persons sending bids should give the number of the lots and the highest price they are willing to give, when the lot will be bought for them as low as possible consistent with the representation of other bids.

David Lucking-Reiley, "Vickrey Auctions in Practice: From Nineteenth-Century Philately to Twenty-First-Century E-Commerce." Journal of Economic Perspectives, Summer 2000, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 183-192.

# Issues in Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

Collusion! "Bidding Rings"

□ A "designated winner" enters a very large number  $(\$ 100)\rightarrow$  then  
□ Other participants submit 0.0 |  
Designated winner gets the good, pays 0.01

Not an issue in First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

Designated winner would enter 0.02  
Everyone else would enter 0.01  
But now people have an incentive to deviate

(others can bid 0.03 and win the auction!)

# Issues in Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

You need to be able to trust the auctioneer!  
The lack of transparency makes it harder to collude

In cases where the information is not revealed after the auction

But now the auctioneer has information that sellers and buyers don't  
■ Auctioneer can manipulate information to their advantage

Suppose the top bids were $10 and $8. The auctioneer can tell the buyer that the winning bid was $9 – how will the buyer know?  
 Suppose the top bids were $10, $8, and $6. The auctioneer can shred the $10 bid and tell the seller that the auction raised only $6, taking a $1 bribe from the second-highest bidder – how will the seller know?

# More Discussions

# Collusion

Collusion is a major problem in auction organization

□ "bidding rings" (lowering seller's revenue)  
strategic "non-cooperative" collusion

Different bidding formats provide different incentives

second-price and English auction formats make it relatively easy to collude  
□ first-price and Dutch auction formats make it hard to collude

# Questions

When is it optimal to use …

□ Open-bid auctions? If there's no fear of collusion

# Revenue Equivalence

# (Supplemental, not in course)

# All-Pay Auction

Bidders submit their bids in sealed envelopes

□ auctioneer opens the envelope and choses the highest bid  
the bidder that submitted the highest bid gets the object  
every bidder pays her bid to the auctioneer  
( this auction can be organized in an open format as well)

Does the all-pay auction bring in more or less revenue than other formats?

# The Revenue Equivalence Theorem

If bidders' value are independently drawn from the same nondegenerate probability distribution, then

□ English auction,  
Dutch auction,  
First-price sealed-bid auction,  
Second-price sealed-bid auction,  
All-pay auction,  
and any other auction that awards the object to the highest bidder bring the same expected revenue to the seller.  
This theorem does not work if values are not independent (e.g., if they are common), yet the theorem is a very important reference point in study of auctions.

# The Chicago Connection

■ Milton Friedman (Econ, Nobel Prize'76) was the first advocate of uniform-price auction for government debt.  
Ronald Coase (Law, Nobel Prize'91) suggested to create the market for radio spectrum.  
Robert Fogel (Booth, Nobel Prize'93) used auction data to estimate the expectations of conflict before the Civil War.  
■ Roger Myerson (Harris, Nobel Prize'07) developed the theory of optimal auctions and proved the revenue equivalence theorem.

# Proof for First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction

# (Supplemental, not in course)

# Solving First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction*

Two bidders, Alice and Bob participate in the first-price sealed-bid auction

□ Alice's value is  $v_{A}$  
Bob's value is  $v_{B}$

Each bidder knows own value and does not know the other's value  
□ thinks that the other's value is equally likely to be any number between 0 and 1

Bidders make their bids

□ Alice's bid  $b_{A} = b_{A}(v_{A})$  
Bob's bid is  $b_{B} = b_{B}(v_{B})$

# The Main Trade-off*

When the envelopes are open, Alice gets

$\square v_{A} - b_{A}, \text{ if } b_{A} > b_{B}$  
□ 0, otherwise

Alice's expected payoff

$$
\pi_ {A} = \pi_ {A} (b _ {A}; v _ {A}) = (v _ {A} - b _ {A}) \times P (b _ {A} > b _ {B})
$$

Alice's tradeoff

□ making bid higher increases the probability of winning  $P\left(b_{A} > b_{B}\right)$  
□ making bid lower increases the payoff if win  $(v_{A} - b_{A})$

# Equilibrium*

Suppose that equilibrium strategies are  $b_{i} = k_{i} \times v_{i}, i = A, B$

$\square$  then  $P\left(b_{A} > b_{B}\right) = P\left(b_{A} > k_{B} \times v_{B}\right) = \frac{1}{k_{B}} b_{A}$

Alice maximizes  $\pi_A = (v_A - b_A) \times \frac{1}{k_B} b_A$

The optimal bid is  $b_{A} = b_{A}(v_{A}) = \frac{1}{2} v_{A}$

□ similarly,  $b_{B} = b_{B}(v_{B}) = \frac{1}{2} v_{B}$

# Rivalry and Exclusion

# Rivalry and Exclusion

Rival good – a good that is used up as it is consumed.  
Excludable – others can be prevented from consuming the good.

# Non-Private Goods

Common resource – a resource that is non-excludable and rival.  
Club good – a good that is non-rival but is subject to exclusion.  
Public good – non-rival and non-excludable.

A public good is a special type of positive externality.  
If a firm reduces the amount of pollution it produces, thereby cleaning the air, it provides a non-priced benefit to its neighbors: a positive externality.

# Public Goods

Non-excludable: If I have access to the good, so do you

Non-rival: My use of the good does not diminish your

access to it

# A Typical Public Good: Trash Collection

Why don't people pay to have their neighbor's trash collected?  
No one wants to pay, but everyone wants someone else to pay.  
■ Private trash collection, financed by a voluntary fee paid by neighborhood residents, faces the classic free rider problem.  
Public goods suffer from this free rider problem.

# Market Failure in Public Goods Provision

# Private Sector Underprovides Public Goods

The market does not produce the efficient amount of public goods because of the free rider problem.  
□ When an investment has a personal cost, but a common benefit, individuals will underinvest.  
Since one person's consumption of a public good also benefits another, the other person may not want to pay (or vice versa).  
This results in the private market producing an inefficiently low quantity of the good.  
This is a standard example of under-provision of a good when there is a positive externality.

# Private Good Provision

Two agents, A and B.  
The optimality condition for the consumption of private good by A and B:

$$
M B ^ {A} = M B ^ {B} = P
$$

Equilibrium on the supply side requires  $MC = P$ . Therefore, in equilibrium,  $MB(= MRS) = MC$ , the marginal cost of production equals the marginal benefit.

# Optimal Public Good Provision

Market efficiency requires that a good be produced until the marginal benefits of production are equal to the marginal costs.  
Since public goods are non-rival, the marginal benefit of a given level of provision is the vertical sum of all individuals' marginal benefit curves.

Total marginal benefit is defined as  $MB_{T} = \sum_{i} MB_{i}$ , where  $i$  indicates each individual.  
The cost side is the same as with any other good.

With public goods, the marginal benefit from the good is not just the benefit for one consumer because many people can consume the good simultaneously!
