# Quantitative Approaches to Inflation-Indexed Bonds

Abstract: Inflation-indexed bonds, as a way of financing government debt, were proposed in the 1920s by economists such as Alfred Marshall and John Maynard Keynes. In Israel, they have been issued since the 1950s and have often dominated that country's bond market. Inflation-indexed sovereign bonds now exist in a broad range of developed countries, as well as in a number of emerging markets. A wide variety of bond structures and tax regimes exist. Issuance volumes and the breadth of the investor base vary widely from country to country; liquidity varies from reasonably good to very poor. When inflation-indexed bonds were introduced in the United States in 1997, there was some disagreement about the degree to which inflation-indexed bonds—called Treasury inflation-protected securities or TIPS—are "risk-free" and the role they should play in a portfolio. In particular, it had not been universally appreciated that these bonds can have volatile mark-to-market returns.

Since their introduction in 1997, Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) have become an established part of the U.S. bond market. This entry reviews the structure of TIPS and the factors that drive TIPS returns; examines the role that TIPS play in a broader bond portfolio, and the nature of TIPS interest rate risk; and discusses some methods employed by TIPS investors to assess value and risk.

# BOND STRUCTURES AND THE CONCEPT OF REAL YIELD

The key features of the TIPS bond structure are summarized here:

- TIPS pay interest semiannually. Interest payments are based on a fixed coupon rate. However, the underlying principal amount of the bonds is indexed to inflation; this inflation-adjusted principal amount is used to calculate the coupon payments, which therefore also rise with inflation. At maturity, the redemption value of the bonds is equal to their inflation-adjusted principal amount, rather than their original par amount.

- The inflation-adjusted principal amount is equal to the original par amount multiplied by an index ratio, which is based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and which is recalculated every day. The index ratio is simply the reference CPI on the relevant date divided by the reference CPI on the issue date. Negative inflation adjustments are not made.


- The reference CPI for the first day of any month is defined to be the non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U for the third preceding calendar month, while the reference CPI for any subsequent day in that month is determined by linearly interpolating the reference CPI for the first of the month and the reference CPI for the first day of the next month.
- Price-yield calculations are as follows. Compute the "real price" of the bond from the quoted real yield via the standard bond pricing formula, using an actual/actual day count basis, round to 3 decimal places (in 100); then multiply the real price by the index ratio to obtain the inflation-adjusted price. Accrued interest is computed in exactly the same way, except that no rounding is carried out.

An attractive feature of the TIPS structure is that inflation indexation occurs with no substantial lag. In the U.K., there is an eight-month lag in the inflation adjustment of index-linked gilts; in Australia and New Zealand, there is a three- to six-month lag. The lag means that real returns from these inflation-indexed bonds are subject to short-term inflation risk and considerably complicates the analysis of the bonds.

The obvious question, of course, is: Where does the real yield come from, and how much can it change? To investors used to thinking of bond yields as being driven by inflation expectations, it is not obvious that real yields should be volatile at all—except perhaps because of temporary imbalances in supply and demand, or changes in liquidity. After all, there are respectable economic theories that suggest that real interest rates should be constant. But in practice, there are various economic reasons why real yields do in fact fluctuate.[1]

# Causes of Real Yield Volatility

The real yield may be defined as the long-term cost of risk-free capital (net of inflation). That is, since TIPS are competing with other investments, real yields on TIPS will move with the cost of capital in the economy as a whole. Of course, other factors affect real yields: For example, index-linked gilts in the U.K. have had artificially low real yields because of their favorable tax treatment and because of a regulatory requirement (since loosened) making it virtually obligatory for pension funds to own them. However, in this entry we will focus on economic and market factors.


Long-term real yields are influenced by expectations about future long-term real interest rates. The two main macroeconomic factors that affect these expectations are:

1. The domestic factor: long-term expected growth in real gross domestic product (GDP). Strong growth generally drives up real interest rates, since the demand for capital tends to rise, and borrowers—expecting higher real returns—are prepared to shoulder higher real borrowing costs.
2. The international factor: long-term expected changes in the current account deficit. Demand for capital is by definition higher in countries with a large current account deficit, driving up domestic interest rates in order to attract required international investment.

Note that short-term trends in real GDP and the current account deficit can have a strong influence on real yields, because they tend to influence the long-term expectations of investors.2 (Roll [1996] has also argued, based on an analysis of tax effects, that real yields should also rise when expected inflation rises; this argument is outlined later in this entry. For the moment we ignore tax effects.)

Real yields on inflation-linked bonds are also influenced by relative demand for these bonds when compared with competing investments that may offer investors some protection—albeit imperfect—against inflation. The balance between competing investments constantly shifts, depending on subjective factors such as investor aversion to different kinds of risk. Relevant investments include:


1. Money market investments: If investors are confident that short-term interest rates will move broadly in line with inflation—which was the case for US monetary policy during the "Great Moderation" period from the early 1980s up to the recent financial crisis, but not before or since—then real returns on money market instruments will be relatively stable over the long term.
2. Equities: When profit margins are stable, corporate profits, and hence dividends and dividend growth rates, tend to rise with the price level; thus, it is reasonable to regard equities as an inflation hedge in the long term (remembering that equity investors are exposed to additional risks in comparison to holders of inflation-indexed bonds).
3. Corporate bonds: As with equities, corporate bond performance is partly linked to inflation: Rising price levels drive up corporate revenues and reduce the real value of existing fixed-rate debt, and both these factors can cause yield spreads to tighten. However, this relationship is often weak and dominated by other factors.
4. Commodities: A basket of commodities also provides a partial hedge against inflation; in practice, this investment alternative was not historically as important as the previous three, though its importance has increased considerably since 2005 as financial innovation has expanded the investor base.

To summarize: Real yields are far from stable, and the behavior of real yields is just as complex as the behavior of nominal yields. Real yields are influenced by both economic fundamentals and market supply/demand factors across asset classes. It is not at all obvious that inflation-linked bonds should be "among the least risky of all assets." Indeed, in the Australian market these securities were long regarded as highly risky in comparison to nominal bonds—though this is partly because of their poorer liquidity.

In all countries where inflation-linked bonds are actively traded, real yields have, historically, been quite volatile. Like nominal yields, market real yields trade in ranges of hundreds of basis points (see Figure 1). Historical examples from other countries include:

- In the U.K., real yields on long index-linked gilts fluctuated between  $2\%$  and  $4.5\%$  in the period 1981-1993. $^{3}$  In the period 1984-1994, real yields on short index-linked gilts fluctuated between  $1.5\%$  and  $5.75\%$ , partly reflecting instability in monetary policy. $^{4}$
- In Israel from 1984-1993, long-dated real yields fluctuated between  $-1.5\%$  and  $3.3\%$ ; however, they more typically traded in the range  $\pm 1\%$ .
- In Australia, real yields have varied from a high of  $5.75\%$  in 1986 and 1994 to a low of  $3.25\%$  in 1993. $^{6}$

Real yields are often estimated by subtracting current (i.e., recent historical) inflation from current nominal bond yields; but this procedure is obviously illogical, as it assumes that expected inflation is equal to current inflation. One can get a better idea of what market real yields would have been by taking nominal yields and subtracting a consensus inflation forecast. Figure 1 shows the 10-year nominal Treasury yield minus the 10-year consensus CPI forecast, as reported in the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters; this measures investors' expectations of real returns on 10-year Treasury bonds and is therefore a reasonable estimate of the 10-year real yield going back several decades. Figure 1 also shows the market real yield of the 10-year TIPS (dating back only to 1997); it is correlated with the survey-based real yield estimate, but not perfectly. We discuss this divergence at the end of the entry.

Even though using consensus data has a number of drawbacks, this rough analysis yields some useful results. The figure shows clearly how long-dated real yields soared in the early

1980s, due to the extreme instability in monetary policy. They stabilized after 1985, once the Fed stopped targeting monetary aggregates and adopted interest rate targeting instead. Since then they have fluctuated between  $5\%$  (in the overheated economy of the late 1980s) and less than  $0.5\%$  (in the crisis and postcrisis periods). Note the apparent link between long-term real yields and current GDP growth in recent years.

Figure 2 shows a more detailed history of TIPS real yields since issuance. It also shows the yield spread between the 10-year TIPS and the 10-year CMT nominal yield. This may be regarded as a rough measure of the market's inflation expectations over the next 10 years.

It's interesting that 10-year TIPS real yields have never been stable, whereas 10-year TIPS break-even inflation was remarkably stable from about 2004-2007, a period of relative macroeconomic stability and strong Fed credibility. Also note the extraordinary period of volatility during the crisis period of late 2008 and early 2009, during which TIPS were highly correlated with risky asset classes such as equities and credit (as predicted above, but per haps not for the fundamental economic reasons cited).


A derivative market for inflation swaps has developed alongside the cash market for inflation-linked bonds. While inflation swaps will not be discussed explicitly in this entry, much of the material is also applicable to them.

# Existence of an Inflation Risk Premium

It is often asserted that real yields on inflation-linked bonds should reflect an inflation risk premium, since investors are not exposed to inflation risk as they are with nominal bonds. Note that if future inflation were known—not necessarily zero—there would be no inflation risk premium; it is uncertainty about inflation that creates a risk premium. The more volatile inflation is expected to be, the higher the inflation risk premium on nominal bonds should be, and the lower real yields should be in relation to nominal yields.

It is important to note that it is uncertainty about future inflation that should determine the risk premium, not the historical volatility of inflation. For example, the inflationary episode of the 1970s is not relevant unless investors think it may be repeated. Investors' expectations about the future volatility of inflation are not directly observable, but it may be helpful to look at economists' estimates. It is also useful to compare expected inflation volatility with expected volatility in real interest rates, since both factors are relevant to the risk/return opportunities offered by inflation-indexed bonds.

Figure 2 TIPS Real Yield History and Spread to Nominal Yield Curve ("Break-Even Inflation")


Note that if the inflation risk premium exists, one would not expect it to be unvarying. Since it is related to market expectations about potential uncertainty in inflation, it is comparable to option-implied volatility. One would thus expect the inflation risk premium to depend on bond maturity, and also to vary over time; for example, if the market lost confidence in the Fed's ability or willingness to control inflation, the inflation risk premium would rise, causing nominal yields to rise relative to real yields. However, since the inflation risk premium is determined by inflation uncertainty over a long period (10 years for the

10-year TIPS), sudden changes should be unusual. Absent unusual shocks to Fed credibility, the inflation risk premium should experience moderate fluctuations, like long-dated swaption implied volatilities, and not sharp ones, like short-dated exchange-traded option implied volatilities.

In the absence of a complete inflation-linked derivatives market, the inflation risk premium is not directly observable. Furthermore, naive attempts to measure it can lead to grossly overstated estimates, and a number of proposed methods for measuring it turn out to be spurious. For example, it has been asserted that the differential between money market and bond yields arises because of an inflation risk premium, which can thus be estimated by looking at the long-term average spread between the Fed Funds rate and the two-year bond yield (about 70 bp in the period since deregulation). This argument has a grain of truth, but the conclusion is incorrect as it stands. The slope of the yield curve reflects a term premium that is not solely attributable to inflation risk. In addition, there are other reasons why money market yields are usually lower than bond yields: Liquidity preference and the impact of capital charges both have important effects. Furthermore, if the spread between money market and bond yields reflects a risk premium, this is not just an inflation risk premium but a real rate risk premium as well.


Also, the argument that the difference between the Fed Funds rate and the two-year bond yield equals the inflation risk premium implies that the yields of money market securities reflect no inflation risk premium, while this risk premium is fully priced into two-year bond yields. This would only be plausible if money market securities were not (perceived to be) subject to inflation risk, and this is far from obvious, particularly since real money market returns were frequently negative during the 1970s.

Thus we must look for more valid ways of estimating what the inflation risk premium should be. There is no strong consensus in the literature, and a surprisingly wide range of estimates appears in the literature, from around 100 bp to modestly negative. However, the most credible estimates tend to fall in the zero to 50 bp range.

One approach is to try to observe inflation uncertainty directly and then derive a "fair" inflation risk premium by applying a market price of risk. Figure 3 shows the probabilities attached by economists to various GDP growth and inflation scenarios; it is taken from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

Economists' forecasts recognize that both inflation and real yields are volatile, and that they have comparable volatilities. It is tempting to conclude that nominal bond yields should indeed reflect an inflation risk premium, since returns on nominal bonds are affected by both inflation volatility and real yield volatility, while returns on inflation-linked bonds are only affected by real yield volatility. And the reported uncertainty in inflation naively leads to an (again, very rough) estimate of the inflation risk premium at the upper end of the range mentioned above. But this conclusion is not necessarily correct.


Based on an analysis of 30 years' worth of cross-country panel data, Judson and Orphanides (1999) have shown that—as one might expect—there is a strong negative correlation between inflation and growth. Thus, as inflation rises, real yields should fall, and vice versa; in other words, the risks arising from fluctuations in inflation and fluctuations in real yields at least partly offset each other, at least over the medium to long term. It is therefore conceivable that, over the medium to long term, a portfolio of nominal bonds may be less risky, not more risky, than a portfolio of inflation-linked bonds, in which case an inflation risk premium need not exist at all. Certainly the situation is more complex than it seems at first.

We can actually use the earlier "economists' estimates" of volatility in real GDP growth and CPI inflation, together with the implied volatility of short-term rates, to compute a rough estimate of the correlation between inflation and growth. Assuming that nominal rates are solely determined by growth and inflation, we have:

$$
\sigma_{n o m}^{2} = \sigma_{G D P}^{2} + \sigma_{C P I}^{2} + 2 \rho \sigma_{G D P} \sigma_{C P I}
$$ where  $\sigma_{GDP}$ ,  $\sigma_{CPI}$  denote the volatility of growth and inflation respectively, and  $\rho$  is the correlation between growth and inflation.


If all three volatilities are around  $1\%$  per annum, then solving this formula for  $\rho$  gives an estimate of around 0.5. However, it would not be meaningful to try to compute a more precise estimate this way.

Incidentally, Judson and Orphanides (1999) also found a strong negative correlation between inflation volatility and growth. In other words, if inflation is expected to become more volatile, real yields should fall, that is, inflation-indexed bond prices should rally. However, in this scenario inflation-linked bonds should outperform nominal bonds, since the inflation risk premium should rise.

# INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS IN A NOMINAL PORTFOLIO

TIPS behave in unique ways and resemble neither nominal Treasuries nor spread products. It's therefore worth going back to basics in order to understand the nature of the interest rate risk inherent in TIPS and the role they can play in broader portfolios.


# What Is the Duration of an Inflation-Indexed Bond?

Inflation-indexed bonds are often used for specialized purposes (e.g., asset/liability management for insurance companies offering inflation-linked life annuities, or for defined benefit plans where benefits are subject to cost of living adjustments), and may thus be segregated from other fixed-income holdings. However, if they are held in the same portfolio as nominal bonds, an interesting problem arises when attempting to define their price sensitivity to rate changes as measured by "duration." We first examine the simplest possible definition of duration and its consequences; then we look at some alternative definitions.


It is easy to compute the duration of an inflation-indexed bond using exactly the same method as one would use for a nominal bond. Because of its low real coupon and low real yield, an inflation-indexed bond tends to have a much longer duration than a nominal bond of comparable maturity.

But what does this duration mean? The duration of a nominal Treasury bond measures its sensitivity to changes in nominal yields, that is, to changes in inflation and real interest rate expectations. By contrast, the duration of an inflation-linked bond measures its sensitivity to changes in real yields, that is, to changes in real interest rate expectations alone. In other words, the two durations are not comparable: They are measuring different things. So, for example, it does not make sense to look for a "reference" nominal yield for the TIPS real yield: While the TIPS yield may appear to trade off the 10-year Treasury during some periods, or off the 5-year Treasury during other periods, there is no fundamental reason why any such relationship should persist.

This creates a problem at the portfolio level. If we try to compute a portfolio duration by adding up the durations of nominal and inflation-indexed bond holdings, what does the resulting figure mean? Two portfolios could have the same duration but, depending on the relative weighting of index-linked bonds, might have a very different response to a change in investors' economic expectations. A simple duration target is no longer an effective way of controlling portfolio interest rate risk.


Thus, when a portfolio contains both nominal and inflation-linked bonds, it is critical to monitor and report the relative weights and durations of the "nominal" and "real" components of the portfolio separately. One approach is to report two durations for the portfolio, which distinguish two sources of risk:

1. A "portfolio real yield duration" equal to the sum of the durations of both nominal and inflation-indexed bond holdings. This shows how the portfolio value will respond to a change in market real yields (which also affect nominal yields).
2. A "portfolio inflation duration" equal to the duration of the nominal bond holdings alone. This shows how the portfolio value will respond to a change in market inflation expectations (which affect nominal yields but not real yields).

Similarly, care must be taken when carrying out portfolio simulations. For example, when carrying out parallel interest rate simulations, it is standard practice to apply an identical yield shift to all securities in the portfolio. For a portfolio containing both nominal and inflation-indexed bonds, this actually corresponds to a "real yield simulation." One should also carry out "expected inflation simulations," where the yield shift is applied to nominal but not inflation-indexed bond yields.

There is one practical situation in which it makes sense to compare the durations of a nominal and inflation-indexed bond directly: when designing trading strategies based on expected inflation. Suppose the central banking authority is targeting a long-term core CPI inflation rate of no more than  $2\%$ ; and suppose that the 10-year nominal yield is  $3.5\%$  while the 10-year real yield is  $0.5\%$ . This means that the market is predicting an average headline CPI inflation rate, over the next 10 years, of  $3\%$ . If one had faith in the central bank's ability to meet its inflation target and one did not believe headline

CPI would consistently outpace core CPI over the next decade, nominal bonds would look undervalued relative to inflation-indexed bonds.

How should one exploit this perceived opportunity without changing exposure to other sources of risk? The correct way is to execute a duration-matched swap, selling 10-year inflation-indexed bonds and buying 10-year nominal bonds. If inflation expectations fall, the strategy would realize a profit. If real interest rate expectations change (i.e., if real yields change), there would be no effect—which is the intention. (This kind of strategy can be implemented more precisely using a full term structure of market inflation forecasts, and incorporating short horizon economist forecasts.)

The above duration calculation is based on the (known) real cash flows and discounts at the real yield. There are other potential ways to compute the "duration" of an inflation-linked bond, which involve forecasting the (unknown) nominal cash flows and discounting using nominal yields on a zero coupon curve basis. The three most obvious alternatives are:

1. Using a fixed inflation forecast, generate projected bond cash flows (one should use a forecast that ensures that the net present value of the forecast cash flows, discounted using the current nominal zero coupon curve, is equal to the current bond price). Compute the duration of this fixed cash flow stream using  $\pm 100$  bp shifts in the nominal zero coupon curve.


2. The same, except that when shifting the zero coupon curve by  $\pm 100$  bp, one recalculates the bond cash flows based on a new inflation forecast, adjusted by  $\pm 1\%$ . That is, the cash flow stream is assumed to depend on the level of nominal yields.
3. The same, except that one adjusts the inflation forecast by an amount different from  $\pm 1\%$ . For example, Figure 4 shows that historically, a 10 bp rise in U.S. nominal yields corresponded, on average, to a 9 bp rise in market long-term inflation expectations (though with much variation around that average). Thus one might adjust the inflation forecast by (say)  $\pm 0.9\%$ . The precise number depends on the reference Treasury yield, and the historical period used to estimate the relationship.

In each case, some minor variations are possible; for example, either constant or time-varying inflation forecasts could be used. These calculations can be related to the above concepts of "real yield duration" and "inflation duration" in the following way:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/dfb71bd1-5f41-4321-b6ab-8e2a5e20500e/743d7a3680418bdb2f7c10b7eb7335738f21384ed3cd6af3529babe3272266fd.jpg)
Figure 4 Shift in Nominal Yield versus Shift in Break-Even Inflation


1. Assuming a fixed cash flow stream (i.e., a fixed inflation scenario) amounts to assuming that the  $\pm 100$  bp shift in nominal yields is due to a change in real yields, not a change in inflation expectations. Thus, this calculation determines the sensitivity to a change in real yields, that is, it is essentially computing a real yield duration and produces an answer very close to the duration calculation described above.
2. Assuming an inflation scenario that varies by  $\pm 1\%$  amounts to assuming that the  $\pm 100$  bp shift in nominal yields is due to a change in inflation expectations. Thus, this calculation measures an inflation duration, that is, a sensitivity to a shift in market inflation expectations, which is conceptually different from the real yield duration. The inflation duration of a TIPS will be approximately zero, but it may depend on the precise way the calculation is carried out.
3. Assuming an inflation scenario that varies by some amount based on the empirical relationship between nominal yields and market inflation expectations amounts to calculating a nominal yield duration, which attempts to measure the sensitivity of an inflation-linked bond to a shift in nominal yields.

Real yield duration is the most important of these risk measures—and, as we have seen, it can be calculated without using an inflation forecast. The inflation duration is not a useful risk measure for TIPS; however, in the U.K. and Australian markets, where inflation-indexed Treasuries have some residual inflation sensitivity due to the lag in inflation indexation, inflation duration is perhaps worth monitoring. The definition of nominal yield duration makes essential use of an estimate about an empirical relationship that is probably unstable, severely limiting the usefulness of this risk measure.

Note that if inflation-indexed Treasury bonds did have stable nominal durations—that is, if they did respond in an absolutely predictable way to a change in nominal yields—then they would not be a very useful risk management tool, since their mark-to-market behavior could be perfectly replicated by nominal bonds, which, moreover, are more liquid. In fact, experience shows that inflation-indexed bonds cannot be hedged perfectly with nominal bonds.

One can also attempt to compute a "tax-adjusted duration" for an inflation-linked bond, which takes its tax treatment into account; this may be of importance in the U.K., where inflation accruals are not taxed. In the U.S. market inflation-linked and nominal bonds are taxed on a broadly consistent basis; in particular, by analogy with Treasury STRIPS, the inflation adjustment to the bond principal is taxable as it occurs, and not simply at bond maturity. Thus, just as one continues to use pretax durations for Treasury STRIPS despite their tax treatment, it seems reasonable to use pretax durations for TIPS as well. The trading behavior of inflation-linked bonds in a range of markets suggests that pretax duration measures suffice for most day-to-day interest rate risk management. However, it is worth discussing tax briefly.

# The Impact of Taxation: An Outline

Inflation-indexed bonds attempt to eliminate inflation risk, but it reappears on an after-tax basis. We begin with the fact that tax affects returns on both nominal bonds and inflation-indexed bonds in an unfortunate way: High inflation results in lower after-tax real returns. For inflation-indexed bonds, an investor would reason as follows: forecast after-tax real yield

= forecast after-tax nominal yield forecast inflation
$= \mathrm{tax}$  rate  $\times$  forecast pretax nominal yield forecast inflation
$= \mathrm{tax}$  rate  $\times$  (pretax real yield
+ forecast inflation) - forecast inflation

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \text{ta xr at e} \times \text{pr et ax re al yi el d} - \\ (1 - \text{ta xr at e}) \cdot \text{fo rc es ti nf la ti on} \\ \end{array}
$$

For nominal bonds, the reasoning is similar: forecast after-tax real yield


= forecast after-tax nominal yield
- forecast inflation
$= \mathrm{tax}$  rate  $\times$  forecast pretax nominal yield forecast inflation
$= \mathrm{tax}$  rate  $\times$  (pretax real yield
+ market inflation) - forecast inflation
$= \mathrm{taxrate} \times \mathrm{pretax}$  real yield
- (forecast inflation
-tax rate  $\cdot$  market inflation) where "forecast inflation" refers to the investor's inflation forecast and "market inflation" refers to the market's inflation forecast as reflected in the spread between market nominal yields and market real yields.


Thus an investor who agrees with the market's inflation forecast and who is thus indifferent between inflation-linked bonds and nominal bonds on a pretax basis will also be indifferent on an after-tax basis. The arguments show that projected after-tax real returns on both inflation-indexed and nominal bonds depend on forecast inflation.

An important consequence is that since U.S. inflation-indexed bonds and nominal bonds are affected equally, inflation-linked bonds do not protect investors against the negative after-tax impact of high inflation. Thus, TIPS real yields reflect only a premium for "pretax inflation risk." By contrast, since U.K. index-linked gilts receive preferential tax treatment, their yields also reflect a premium for "after-tax inflation risk." The price paid by U.K. investors, as observed by Roll (1996) and by Brown and Schaefer (1996), is lower liquidity: The market for index-linked gilts is confined to investors with high marginal tax rates and to investors who have other incentives, such as regulatory incentives, to own inflation-linked securities.[10] Roll (1996) points out a further consequence: If the demand for inflation-indexed or nomi nal bonds is a function of expected after-tax returns, pretax real yields should rise as expected inflation rises, to maintain a constant after-tax real yield. It is not clear whether real yields on inflation-indexed bonds actually behave in this way, although the Australian experience in 1994 suggests that they do. In any case, this introduces a further source of uncertainty about the future behavior of real yields.


# Inflation-Indexed Bonds and Portfolio Efficiency

Inflation-indexed bonds have a risk profile quite different from that of nominal bonds. In fact, it could be argued that for asset allocation purposes, they should not be grouped with nominal bonds but should be treated as an entirely separate asset class. We will use portfolio theory to explore the consequences of adopting this point of view. More specifically, we will try to determine what weight TIPS should have in efficient portfolios with varying degrees of risk, and what impact their inclusion has on expected returns.

For simplicity, we focus on maximizing nominal returns in the U.S. market, and we work in a total return framework. Other kinds of analysis are possible; for example, Eichholtz, Naber, and Petri (1993) discuss the problem of matching inflation-indexed liabilities in the U.K. and Israeli markets.

The results of any Markowitz-style analysis are always highly dependent on the expected returns, volatilities, and correlations used. The assumptions we use are set out in Table 1 and are broadly based on market data and presumed market expectations. They were derived as follows:

1. Expected nominal returns for cash and nominal bonds (aggregate bond index) are based on current market yields—this is more meaningful than using historical returns. For simplicity, we assume that nominal bonds and TIPS have the same expected return (in practice, one would derive expected returns more

The expected return for equities is obtained by adding a risk premium of  $3\%$  to that for bonds.


2. Return volatilities for cash, nominal bonds, TIPS, and equities are historical, calculated using monthly Barclays index return data and S&P 500 return data over the period 1997-2011. In addition to the historical volatility for TIPS—which is quite high, largely due to the experience during the crisis period—we also carry out an alternative analysis that assumes that they have the same volatility as nominal bonds.
3. We use historical correlations estimated using the same time period.

At first glance, the results seem highly dependent on the volatility assumption used for TIPS. Figure 5 shows the composition of theoretically efficient portfolios with varying degrees of risk, using the realistic volatility assumption; Figure 6 shows the same, using the low volatility assumption. Using the higher volatility, TIPS play almost no role in any efficient portfolio; for example, at moderate risk levels, nominal bonds are preferred because of their lower correlation with equities. However, using the lower volatility, TIPS have a much more important role to play. They partly displace cash at low risk levels, and more importantly they partly displace nominal bonds at moderate risk levels. Only the equity weightings remain more or less unchanged.

But how much value do TIPS actually add? Figure 7 shows the efficient frontier; that is, expected returns from efficient portfolios, calculated using both the realistic and low TIPS volatility assumptions. Above the  $2\%$  risk level, they are very close: Expected returns differ only marginally. That is, even assuming that TIPS will have a very low return volatility does not significantly increase their expected value added to portfolio returns unless different expected return assumptions are used as well (or unless we move beyond the pure mean-variance framework).

Figure 8 is even more telling. It shows expected returns from efficient portfolios under the low TIPS volatility assumption for both unconstrained portfolios and portfolios from which TIPS have been excluded. Even at moderate risk levels, where TIPS are most important, the difference in expected returns is extremely modest. Moreover, an investor who currently held a TIPS-free portfolio, and who wanted to capture these additional few basis points by

Figure 8 Efficient Portfolios Including and Excluding TIPS


The overall conclusions are that (1) a realistic TIPS return volatility assumption, consistent with historical experience, implies that TIPS do not add much value to asset allocation; and (2) even under a very optimistic TIPS return volatility assumption, the value added by TIPS is modest. The main reasons are that TIPS do not have a higher expected return than nominal bonds, but have a slightly higher assumed correlation with equities.

These results should be compared with the findings of Eichholtz, Naber, and Petri (1993), who used data from 1983-1991 and discovered a significant difference between relatively low-inflation countries such as the U.K. in that period and countries such as Israel where inflation had been extremely high and volatile.

- Results for the U.K.: If the goal is to maximize total return, inflation-linked bonds do not appear in any efficient portfolio. If inflation-linked liabilities are included in the problem (but setting regulatory considerations aside), they appear in very low-risk efficient portfolios, but with negligible weight: less than  $1\%$ .

- Results for Israel: If the goal is to maximize total return, inflation-linked bonds play a minor role in low-risk portfolios but a major role in risky portfolios, sometimes having a weight of over  $50\%$ . If inflation-linked liabilities are included in the problem, inflation-linked bonds play a major role at all levels of risk, with weights between  $44\%$  and  $88\%$ .

TIPS provide insurance against inflation, and each investor's subjective assessment of future inflation risk and the need for inflation protection must strongly influence any conclusions about the role of TIPS. U.S. investors will have to decide which set of results provides more useful guidance.

# ADVANCED ANALYTICAL APPROACHES TO INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS

As the U.S. TIPS market has matured, with a full term structure of maturities and a trading history spanning several business cycles and inflation environments, investors have developed many analytical approaches in the search for investment opportunities. Rather than attempting a comprehensive survey, the remainder of this entry gives two brief examples, both of them focusing on economic factors rather than supply/demand relationships or "market technicals." Standard econometric techniques turn out to be useful.


# Link between TIPS Performance and Short-Term Inflation

The relative performance of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries is determined both by daily mark-to-market movements and by inflation accrual, which influences both inflation-adjusted principal and interest payments. Inflation accrual is clearly determined by realized headline CPI inflation (relative to nominal yields). Since headline CPI is quite volatile, this "carry" component of TIPS returns can often be a dominant factor in the performance of short and even intermediate maturity TIPS.

One useful way of looking at this is by isolating the impact of the more volatile components of CPI. Bryan and Meyer (2010) divide the CPI basket into "flexible price" and "sticky price" categories, leading to two separate measures of inflation. Examples of flexible price items are gasoline, fruit and vegetables, and women's apparel; examples of sticky price items are furniture, alcoholic beverages, and public transportation.


Figure 9 shows that during the period since the introduction of TIPS in 1997, there was a positive correlation between changes in 10-year TIPS break-even inflation and changes in three-month flexible price CPI inflation. It may seem surprising that 10-year inflation expectations are visibly influenced by realized three-month inflation; but this simply reflects the strong influence of carry on the trading behavior of TIPS, even 10-year maturity TIPS.

We can get a more refined view of the relationship if we run a vector autoregression analysis and examine the impulse-response functions. Some of the results from an analysis using 2003-2011 data on five-year TIPS (i.e., a shorter maturity, more strongly influenced by carry considerations) are shown in Figure 10. The impulse-response functions suggest that:

1. 5-year TIPS break-even inflation responds more strongly to flexible price CPI than

2. Shocks to flexible price CPI inflation tend to be quite short-lived, dissipating after a couple of months and even tending to (partially) correct.

Since TIPS inflation accrual is based on nonseasonally-adjusted headline CPI inflation, a further aspect of TIPS carry is the strong seasonal pattern exhibited by CPI inflation. This needs to be analyzed separately. Seasonal factors have often been a source of market inefficiency in the past.

# The TIPS Premium versus Survey-Based Real Yield Measures

As can be seen from Figure 1, TIPS real yields have usually (but not always) been higher than the real yields implied by subtracting consensus inflation forecasts from observed nominal Treasury yields. In other words, TIPS real yields usually incorporate an apparent "concession." The historical behavior of this apparent real yield premium is shown in Figure 11, together with an estimate of its trend behavior (derived by applying a standard Hodrick-Prescott filter $^{11}$ ).

This premium has averaged around 40-50 bp, but has fluctuated quite a bit over time. It seems to mean revert to trend (heavy line in Figure 11) over about a 12-month period on average.

Why would this premium exist?

1. Survey bias: Economists' forecasts of future inflation may be systematically biased (higher) relative to the market's forecasts. This is more likely to have been true during the period of declining trend inflation from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s; and indeed the real yield premium seems to have decreased since then, though it has still been positive on average.


2. Recalculation risk: There may be a downward bias to the risk of future changes to the definition of CPI. $^{12}$
3. Liquidity: TIPS are less liquid than nominals (i.e., they have wider and more uncertain bid/ask spreads, and greater market impact of large trades), so investors require a higher real yield to compensate for that.
4. Tracking error: TIPS aren't in the standard bond indexes, so index-sensitive investors need to be compensated for the fact that owing TIPS leads to additional tracking error.
5. Undesirable correlations: TIPS tend to underperform in deflations/recessions, which is when investors most want bonds to do well; another kind of undesirable correlation is that TIPS liquidity tends to deteriorate in periods of general market stress.

The first two factors are difficult to quantify, but one could argue that their influence is probably fairly constant over time. It thus seems feasible to develop relative value measures conditioned on the remaining three factors, which are potentially more tractable.

Figure 11 Apparent TIPS Real Yield Premium

The (il)liquidity premium turns out to be particularly important, since it exhibits the most time variation. It is difficult to estimate based on yield data alone;[13] furthermore, as with all liquidity premiums, it is not fully determined by prevailing liquidity conditions (bid/ask spreads, quoted volumes, and market impact of trades) but is also influenced by the perceived risk that future liquidity conditions may differ from today's.

Modeling liquidity premiums is extremely difficult, but useful information can be extracted via model-free approaches. For example, Christensen and Gillan (2011) argue that the difference between TIPS break-even inflation and inflation swap rates provides a time-varying upper bound on the TIPS liquidity premium. This upper bound has typically fluctuated between 10 bp and 20 bp, but rose to over 100 bp in late 2008 during the financial crisis; it has been highly correlated with other measures of bond liquidity, such as the yield premium of off-the-run versus on-the-run nominal Treasuries.

# KEY POINTS

- TIPS real yields are volatile. They are influenced by domestic growth, external balances, and the behavior of competing asset classes.
- TIPS real yields also reflect a modest and somewhat volatile inflation risk premium.
- There are different notions of TIPS duration corresponding to different aspects of TIPS interest rate risk.
- TIPS often do not play a significant role in efficient portfolios, and some investors may be better off regarding them as opportunistic rather than core investments.
- Market returns on TIPS are often driven by short-term inflation accrual, and this is best analyzed by breaking observed inflation down into suitable components.
Survey-based measures of inflation and real yields often differ from those implied by the

TIPS market, and it is important for investors to understand the reasons for the divergence.
