# Yield Curves and Valuation Lattices

Abstract: The complication in valuing bonds with embedded options and option-type derivatives is that cash flows depend on interest rates in the future. Academicians and practitioners have attempted to capture this interest rate uncertainty through various models, often designed as one- or two-factor processes. These models attempt to capture the stochastic behavior of rates. In practice, these elegant mathematical models must be implemented numerically in order to be useful. One such model is a single factor model that assumes a stationary variance, or volatility.

An often-used framework for the valuation of interest rate instruments with embedded options and interest rate option-type derivatives is the lattice framework. Effectively, the lattice specifies the distribution of short-term interest rates over time. The lattice holds all the information required to perform the valuation of certain option-like interest rate products. First, the lattice is used to generate the cash flows across the life of the security. Next, the interest rates on the lattice are used to compute the present value of those cash flows.

There are several interest rate models that have been used in practice to construct an interest rate lattice. In each case, interest rates can realize one of several possible levels when we move from one period to the next. A lattice model that allows only two rates in the next period is called a binomial model. A lattice model that allows three possible rates in the next period is called a trinomial model. There are even more complex models that allow more than three possible rates in the next period.


Regardless of the underlying assumptions, each model shares a common restriction. In order to be "arbitrage-free," the interest rate tree generated must produce a value for an on-the-run optionless bond that is consistent with the current par yield curve. In effect, the value generated by the model must be equal to the observed market price for the optionless instrument. Under these conditions the model is said to be "arbitrage free." A lattice that produces an arbitrage-free valuation is said to be "fair." The lattice is used for valuation only when it has been calibrated to be fair. More on calibration below.


In this entry we will demonstrate how a lattice is used to value an option-free bond. The model is also used to value bonds with embedded options, floating-rate securities with option-type derivatives, bond options, and swaptions.

# THE INTEREST RATE LATTICE

In our illustration, we represent the lattice as a binomial tree, the simplest lattice form. Figure 1 provides an example of a binomial interest rate tree, which consists of a number of "nodes" and "legs." Each leg represents a one-year interval over time. A simplifying assumption of one-year intervals is made to illustrate the key principles. The methodology is the same for smaller time periods. In fact, in practice the selection of the length of the time period is critical, but we need not be concerned with this nuance here.

The distribution of future interest rates is represented on the tree by the nodes at each point in time. Each node is labeled as "N" and has a subscript, a combination of  $L$ 's and  $H$ 's. The subscript indicates whether the node is lower or higher on the tree, respectively, relative to the other nodes. Thus, node  $N_{HH}$  is reached when the 1-year rate realized in the first year is the higher of the two rates for that period, then the highest of the rates in the second year.

Figure 1 Four-Year Binomial Interest Rate Tree


The root of the tree is  $N$ , the only point in time at which we know the interest rate with certainty. The 1-year rate today (that is, at  $N$ ) is the current 1-year spot rate, which we denote by  $r_0$ .

We must make an assumption concerning the probability of reaching one rate at a point in time. For ease of illustration, we have assumed that rates at any point in time have the same probability of occurring. In other words, the probability is  $50\%$  on each leg.

The interest rate model we will use to construct the binomial tree assumes that the 1-year rate evolves over time based on a lognormal random walk with a known (stationary) volatility. Technically, the tree represents a one-factor model. Under the distributional assumption, the relationship between any two adjacent rates at a point in time is calculated via the following equation:

$$ r_{1, H} = r_{1, L} e^{2 \sigma \sqrt{t}}
$$ where  $\sigma$  is the assumed volatility of the 1-year rate,  $t$  is the length of the time period in years, and  $e$  is the base of the natural logarithm. Since we assume a 1-year interval, that is,  $t = 1$ , we can disregard the calculation of the square root of  $t$  in the exponent.


For example, suppose that  $r_{1,L}$  is  $4.4448\%$  and  $\sigma$  is  $10\%$  per year, then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} r_{1, H} = 4.4448 \% \left(e^{2 \times 0.10}\right) = 4.4448 \% (1.2214) \\ = 5.4289\% \\ \end{array}
$$

In the second year, there are three possible values for the 1-year rate. The relationship between  $r_{2,LL}$  and the other two 1-year rates is as follows:

$$ r_{2, H H} = r_{2, L L} \left(e^{4 \sigma}\right) \quad \text{an d} \quad r_{2, H L} = r_{2, L L} \left(e^{2 \sigma}\right)
$$

Figure 2 Four-Year Binomial Interest Rate Tree with 1-Year Rates*

So, for example, if  $r_{2,LL}$  is  $4.6958\%$ , and assuming once again that  $\sigma$  is  $10\%$ , then

$$ r_{2,HH} = 4.6958\% (e^{4\times 0.10}) = 7.0053\%
$$ and


$$ r_{2,HL} = 4.6958\% (e^{2\times 0.10}) = 5.7354\%
$$

This relationship between rates holds for each point in time. Figure 2 shows the interest rate tree using this notation.

# Determining the Value at a Node

In general, to get a security's value at a node we follow the fundamental rule for valuation: The value is the present value of the expected cash flows. The appropriate discount rate to use for cash flows one year forward is the 1-year rate at the node where we are computing the value. Now there are two present values in this case: the present value of the cash flows in the state where the 1-year rate is the higher rate, and one where it is the lower rate state. We have assumed that the probability of both outcomes is equal. Figure 3 provides an illustration for a node assuming that the 1-year rate is  $r^*$  at the node where the valuation is sought and letting:

Figure 3 Calculating a Value at a Node

$V_{H} =$  the bond's value for the higher 1-year rate state

$V_{L} =$  the bond's value for the lower 1-year rate state

$C =$  coupon payment

From where do the future values come? Effectively, the value at any node depends on the future cash flows. The future cash flows include (1) the coupon payment one year from now and (2) the bond's value one year from now, both of which may be uncertain. Starting the process from the last year in the tree and working backwards to get the final valuation resolves the uncertainty. At maturity, the instrument's value is known with certainty—par. The final coupon payment can be determined from the coupon rate, or from prevailing rates to which it is indexed. Working back through the tree, we realize that the value at each node is quickly calculated. This process of working backward is often referred to as recursive valuation.

Using our notation, the cash flow at a node is either:

$V_{H} + C$  for the higher 1-year rate

$V_{L} + C$  for the lower 1-year rate

The present value of these two cash flows using the 1-year rate at the node,  $r^*$ , is:

$\frac{V_H + C}{(1 + r^*)} =$  present value for higher 1-year rate

$\frac{V_L + C}{(1 + r^*)} =$  present value for lower 1-year rate

Then, the value of the bond at the node is found as follows:

$$
\mathrm{Va lu ea ta no de} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{V_{H} + C}{(1 + r^{*})} + \frac{V_{L} + C}{(1 + r^{*})} \right]
$$

# CALIBRATING THE LATTICE

We noted above the importance of the no-arbitrage condition that governs the construction of the lattice. To assure this condition holds, the lattice must be calibrated to the current par yield curve, a process we demonstrate here. Ultimately, the lattice must price optionless par bonds at par.

Assume the on-the-run par yield curve for a hypothetical issuer as it appears in Table 1. The current 1-year rate is known,  $3.50\%$ . Hence, the next step is to find the appropriate 1-year rates one year forward. As before, we assume that volatility,  $\sigma$ , is  $10\%$  and construct a 2-year tree using the 2-year bond with a coupon rate of  $4.2\%$ , the par rate for a 2-year security.

Figure 4 shows a more detailed binomial tree with the cash flow shown at each node. The root rate for the tree,  $r_0$ , is simply the current 1-year rate,  $3.5\%$ . At the beginning of Year 2 there are two possible 1-year rates, the higher rate and the lower rate. We already know the relationship between the two. A rate of  $4.75\%$  at  $N_L$  has been arbitrarily chosen as a starting point. An iterative process determines the proper rate (that is, trial and error). The steps are described and illustrated below. Again, the goal is a rate that, when applied in the tree, provides a value of par for the 2-year,  $4.2\%$  bond.

Step 1: Select a value for  $r_1$ . Recall that  $r_1$  is the lower 1-year rate. In this first trial, we arbitrarily selected a value of  $4.75\%$ .

Table 1 Issuer Par Yield Curve

<table><tr><td>Maturity</td><td>Par Rate</td><td>Market Price</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>3.50\%</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>4.20\%</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>3 years</td><td>4.70\%</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>4 years</td><td>5.20\%</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

Figure 4 The 1-Year Rates for Year 1 Using the 2-Year  $4.2\%$  On-the-Run Issue: First Trial

Step 2: Determine the corresponding value for the higher 1-year rate. As explained earlier, this rate is related to the lower 1-year rate as follows:  $r_1 e^{2\sigma}$ . Since  $r_1$  is  $4.75\%$ , the higher 1-year rate is  $5.8017\%$  ( $= 4.75\% e^{2x0.10}$ ). This value is reported in Figure 4 at node  $N_H$ .

Step 3: Compute the bond's value one year from now as follows: a. Determine the bond's value two years from now. In our example, this is simple. Since we are using a 2-year bond, the bond's value is its maturity value (\$100) plus its final coupon payment (\$4.2). Thus, it is 104.2.

b. Calculate  $V_{H}$ . Cash flows are known. The appropriate discount rate is the higher 1-year rate,  $5.8017\%$  in our example. The present value is \$98.486 (= \$ 104.2/ 1.058017).
c. Calculate  $V_{L}$ . Again, cash flows are known—the same as those in Step 3b. The discount rate assumed for the lower 1-year rate is  $4.75\%$ . The present value is $99.475 (= $104.2/1.0475).

Step 4: Calculate  $V$ a. Add the coupon to both VH and VL to obtain the values at NH and NL, respectively. In our example we have \$102.686 for the higher rate and \$103.675 for the lower rate.


b. Calculate V. The 1-year rate is  $3.50\%$ . (Note: At this point in the valuation,  $r^*$  is the root rate,  $3.50\%$ . Therefore,  $\$99.691 = 1/2$  ( \$99.214 +100.169.)

Step 5: Compare the value in Step 4 to the bond's market value. If the two values are the same, then the  $r_1$  used in this trial is the one we seek. If, instead, the value found in Step 4 is not equal to the market value of the bond, then  $r_1$  in this trial is not the 1-year rate that is consistent with the current yield curve. In this case, the five steps are repeated with a different value for  $r_1$ .

When r1 is 4.75\%, a value of \$99.691 results in Step 4, which is less than the observed market price of \$100. Therefore, 4.75\% is too large and the five steps must be repeated trying a lower rate for r1.

Let's jump right to the correct rate for  $r_1$  in this example and rework Steps 1 through 5. This occurs when  $r_1$  is  $4.4448\%$ . The corresponding binomial tree is shown in Figure 5. The value at the root is equal to the market value of the 2-year issue (par).

We can "grow" this tree for one more year by determining  $r_2$ . Now we will use the 3-year on-the-run issue, the  $4.7\%$  coupon bond, to get  $r_2$ . The same five steps are used in an iterative process to find the 1-year rates in the tree two years from now. Our objective is now to find the value of  $r_2$  that will produce a bond value of 100. Note that the two rates one year from now of 4.4448\% (the lower rate) and 5.4289\% (the higher rate) do not change. These are the fair rates for the tree one year forward.

Figure 6 Information for Deriving the 1-Year Rates for Year 2 Using the 3-Year  $4.7\%$  On-the-Run Issue


The problem is illustrated in Figure 6. The cash flows from the 3-year,  $4.7\%$  bond are in place. All we need to perform a valuation are the rates at the start of Year 3. In effect, we need to find  $r_2$  such that the bond prices at par. Again, an arbitrary starting point is selected, and an iterative process produces the correct rate.

The completed version of Figure 6 is found in Figure 7. The value of  $r_2$ , or equivalently

Figure 7 The 1-Year Rates for Year 2 Using the 3-Year  $4.7\%$  On-the-Run Issue

r_{2,LL}, which will produce the desired result is 4.6958\%. The corresponding rates r_{2,HL} and r_{2,HH} would be 5.7354\% and 7.0053\%, respectively. To verify that these are the correct 1-year rates two years from now, work backwards from the four nodes at the right of the tree in Figure 7. For example, the value in the box at N_{HH} is found by taking the value of \104.7 at the two nodes to its right and discounting at 7.0053\%. The value is \97.846. Similarly, the value in the box at N_{HL} is found by discounting \104.70 by 5.7354\% and at N_{LL} by discounting at 4.6958\%.

# USING THE LATTICE FOR VALUATION

To illustrate how to use the lattice for valuation purposes, consider a  $6.5\%$  option-free bond with four years remaining to maturity. Since this bond is option-free, it is not necessary to use the lattice model to value it. All that is necessary to obtain an arbitrage-free value for this bond is to discount the cash flows using the spot rates obtained from bootstrapping the yield curve shown in Table 1. (All calculations are highly sensitive to the number of decimal places chosen.) The spot rates are as follows:

<table><tr><td>1-year</td><td>3.5000\%</td></tr><tr><td>2-year</td><td>4.2147\%</td></tr><tr><td>3-year</td><td>4.7345\%</td></tr><tr><td>4-year</td><td>5.2707\%</td></tr></table>

Discounting the  $6.5\%$  4- year option-free bond with a par value of \$100 at the above spot rates would give a bond value of \$ 104.643.

Figure 8 contains the fair tree for a four-year valuation. Figure 9 shows the various values in the discounting process using the lattice in Figure 8. The root of the tree shows the bond value of 104.643, the same value found by discounting at the spot rate. This demonstrates that the lattice model is consistent with the valuation of an option-free bond when using spot rates.

Figure 8 Binomial Interest Rate Tree for Valuing up to a 4-Year Bond for Issuer (10\% Volatility Assumed)

The lesson here can be applied to more complex instruments, those with option features that require the lattice-based process for proper valuation and derivatives such as swaptions. Regardless of the security or derivative to be valued, the generation of the lattice follows the same no-arbitrage principles outlined here. Subsequently, cash flows are determined at each node, the recursive valuation process undertaken to arrive at fair values. Hence, a single lattice and a valuation process prove to be robust means for obtaining fair values for a wide variety of fixed income instruments.

# KEY POINTS

- The complication in valuing bonds with embedded options and option-type derivatives is that cash flows depend on interest rates in the future.
- In practice, several interest rate models have been employed to construct an interest rate lattice. In each case, interest rates can realize one of several possible levels when we move from one period to the next. There are binomial lattices (two possible rates in the next period), trinomial lattices (three possible rates in the next period), and even more complex models that allow more than three possible rates in the next period.

Figure 9 Valuing an Option-Free Bond with Four Years to Maturity and a Coupon Rate of  $6.5\%$  (10\% Volatility Assumed)

- Several models have been developed to value bonds with embedded options and option-type interest rate derivatives, the most common model being a one-factor model.
- The lattice framework uses an arbitrage-free interest rate lattice or tree to generate the cash flows over the life of the financial instrument and then to determine the present value of the cash flow. The present value of the cash flow is then the fair value of the financial instrument.
- The lattice must be constructed so as to be consistent with (that is, calibrated to) the observed market value of an on-the-run option-free issue.
