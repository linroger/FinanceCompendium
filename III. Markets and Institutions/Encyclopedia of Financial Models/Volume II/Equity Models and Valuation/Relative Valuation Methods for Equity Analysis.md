Abstract: Relative valuation methods use multiples or ratios, such as price/earnings, price/book, or price/free cash flow, to determine whether a particular firm is trading at higher or lower multiples than its peers. Such methods require the user to choose a suitable universe of firms that are more or less comparable, though this can become difficult for firms with unusual characteristics in terms of product mix or geographical exposure. Relative valuation methods can be useful for portfolio managers who expect to be fully invested at all times, as they provide a practical tool for attempting to capture the "value premium" by which firms trading at lower multiples tend to outperform those trading at higher multiples. Implicitly, relative valuation methods assume that the average multiple across the universe of firms can be treated as a reasonable approximation of "fair value" for those firms; this may be problematic during periods of market panic or euphoria.

Much research in corporate finance and similar academic disciplines is tilted toward the use of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. However, many analysts also make use of relative valuation methods, which compare several firms by using multiples or ratios. Multiples that are commonly used for such purposes include price/earnings, price/book, and price/free cash flow.

Relative valuation methods implicitly assume that "similar" firms are likely to be valued similarly by investors. Therefore, on average, we would expect that firms that are generally comparable are likely to trade at similar multiples, in terms of price/earnings, price/book, or various other metrics. If this assumption is approximately correct, then relative valuation methods can be used to identify firms that look "cheap" or "expensive" relative to their peers. When a particular firm's multiples are extremely different from the rest of the universe, this may indicate a potential investment opportunity—though further analysis will likely be required to determine whether there are reasons why such a firm is valued differently from other companies that otherwise appear comparable.

Relative valuation approaches can only be employed if there is sufficient information, produced on an approximately consistent footing, about the various companies that are the subjects of analysis. In most countries, companies that are publicly listed on stock exchanges are required by law and regulation to report their historical results publicly in a timely manner, or risk being delisted from the exchange. (There may be occasional exceptions to this general pattern, particularly for entities that are majority owned or controlled by their home country government. But such anomalies are not frequently observed except during crisis periods.) Consequently, it is almost always possible to obtain information about listed companies' historical results. However, multiples based solely on historical data may not provide a complete picture, as most analysts would probably agree that forward-looking estimates are likely to provide more useful insights into the market's opinion of a particular company (Valentine, 2011, p. 261).

Investment banks, rating agencies, and other firms can provide estimates of a firm's future earnings, revenues, and other metrics, typically over the next two or three years. Various data providers such as Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters collect such information and use it as the basis for "consensus" estimates, which can be viewed as representing the market's general opinion of a company's future prospects. It is also possible to use a firm's own in-house estimates for the companies under coverage, as these may incorporate insights that are not yet reflected in current pricing. However, for precisely this reason, in-house estimates should be used as a supplement rather than as a replacement for consensus figures.


It is conventional to consider more than one year of data, as there may be disparities in how the market is valuing results in the immediate future and in the slightly longer term. However, it is often difficult or impossible to obtain consensus estimates more than two or three years into the future. Consequently, relative valuation approaches generally focus on relatively short periods into the future, rather than seeking to gauge how the market is valuing expected performance five or ten years hence. (In this respect, relative valuation analysis can be viewed as somewhat limited by comparison with DCF approaches, which typically give considerably more attention to the relatively distant future.)

## Number of Comparable Firms

## Basis for Selecting Comparable Firms

In an ideal situation, a universe of comparable companies would be similar in terms of size, industry focus, and geography. This tends to be easier when considering small or mid-sized firms—say, with market caps between  \$100 million and\$ 10 billion (based on 2010 U.S. dollars). Firms that are below this size limit, in other words microcap stocks, may be more difficult to use for relative valuation purposes. Even if these firms are public, they may receive less coverage from research analysts, who typically are more interested in companies that are large, liquid, and already owned by institutional investors (see Bhushan, 1989).

Conversely, it can also be difficult to perform relative value analysis on companies with relatively high market capitalization. Many large firms are dominant players in their particular market niches, in which case they may be more likely to trade at a premium reflecting their higher degree of market power. Alternatively, large firms may be effectively a conglomerate of numerous smaller entities, each engaged in a specific activity, and there may be no other large or small firm that produces an approximately equivalent blend of goods and/or services.

When attempting to assess the relative value of firms that are large and/or complex, it can often be useful to assess "relative value" using two separate approaches. The first approach is to consider the firm as a complete entity and try to find other firms that are at least somewhat comparable in terms of size and complexity, even if their business mix is not precisely identical. In such cases, it can often be useful to consider similar firms that may be located in other countries, even though their different geographical positioning may affect their level of risk and thus the multiples at which they trade. The second approach is to use a sum-of-the-parts valuation method, which will be discussed in more detail later in this entry.


## Geography and Clientele

## Sector and Industry Characteristics

Some academic research has examined different ways of selecting a universe of comparable firms. Bhojraj, Lee, and Oler (2003) compared the effect of using four different industry classification methods, and concluded that at least for a universe of U.S. securities, the Global Industry Classification Standard (jointly developed and maintained by Standard & Poor's and Morgan Stanley Capital International) appeared to do the best job of identifying firms with similar valuation multiples and stock price movements. Chan, Lakonishok, and Swaminathan (2007) compared the effect of using industry classification schemes with statistically based clustering approaches, and found that examining stocks in terms of industry membership seemed to give better explanatory power than working in terms of either sectors or subindustries. To our knowledge, there have not been any parallel investigations into the effectiveness of different industry classification schemes for cross-national analysis. The results of Phylaktis and Xia (2006) suggest that the importance of sector-level effects has been increasing in recent years, while the influence of country-level effects has waned slightly.


## Technology and Intraindustry Diversity

## Bimodal and Multimodal Patterns

Sometimes the outcome of a relative value analysis will show that the valuation multiples are not evenly spread between low and high, but instead are bimodal or multimodal—in other words, there seem to be two or more clusters of results. We show an example of this in our hypothetical example below, which suggests that in a universe of seven firms, two are expected to achieve a return on equity (ROE) of  $11\%$  to  $12\%$  in FY0 and FY1, whereas the other companies are generally projected to deliver an

ROE of  $8\%$  to  $9\%$ . Such differences may appear relatively minor, but if the market really does expect these outcomes, then the two companies with higher profitability may legitimately be expected to trade at a premium to their peers.

When a relative valuation table appears to have bimodal or multimodal characteristics, an analyst will generally be well advised to investigate further. In any given sector or industry, there may well be some firms that are truly capable of producing higher returns than their peers, perhaps as a result of better management, a stronger market position, or a more supportive regulatory environment. Relative valuation methods can identify potential outliers of this type, but cannot test whether the estimates themselves are reasonable.

One potentially useful approach is to extend the analysis further back into the past, using historical prices for valuation purposes, and if possible also using as-was projections for the relevant period. Such projections are now widely available from various different data vendors, including Bloomberg, FactSet, and Thomson Reuters. Consider the companies that are currently trading at a premium or a discount to their peers—did they also trade at a discount to their peers in the past? A logical extension of relative value analysis based on a single period is to gauge whether a particular firm persistently tends to trade at a lower or higher multiple than its peers, and then assess whether its current multiple is above or below what would be expected on the basis of prior periods. Damodaran (2006, Chapter 7, p. 244) notes that relative valuations frequently have low persistence over time. For industries in which this is the case, then relative valuation methods may indeed provide useful investment signals.

## Choice of Valuation Multiples

## Choice of Numerator: Market Cap versus Firm Value

In some instances, the choice of numerator may have a significant impact on the multiple. For instance, many analysts will use price/sales ratios for valuation purposes. However, a firm's revenues are generated from the total of its capital base, comprising both equity and debt.

Consider two companies, A and B, which both have a current market cap of  \$300 million and projected annual revenues of\$ 600 million in FY0, so that they both have a current price/sales ratio of 2. But suppose that Company A has no outstanding borrowings, whereas Company B has net debt of 300 million. One could argue that Company B is actually rather less attractive than Company A, as apparently it requires twice as much capital to generate the same volume of sales. In effect, analyzing the company in terms of "firm value/sales" rather than price/sales would reveal that Company B is actually making less efficient use of its capital than Company A.

There is no single definition of "firm value" that is generally accepted by all practitioners. In an ideal world, one would want to have the market value of the firm's equity capital and of the firm's debt capital. However, because corporate bonds and bank loans typically are not traded in liquid markets, there may not be any reliable indicator of the market value of debt capital. Consequently, it is conventional to use market capitalization to estimate how investors are valuing the firm's equity capital, but then to use figures from the firm's most recent balance sheet together with the notes to the financial statements as a proxy for net debt. The broadest definition of which we are aware is the following:


Net Debt = Total Short-Term Debt

+ Total Long-Term Debt + Minority Interest

+Unfunded Pension Liabilities

Cash and Equivalents

In practice, for most firms, the biggest components of net debt are likely to be total short-term debt, total long-term debt, and cash and equivalents. In most cases, using an alternative definition of firm value will often have only a small impact on the calculated multiple.

Conceptually, it is possible to divide the income statement between the line items that are generated on the basis of total capital, and those that pertain solely to equity capital. For most firms, the separator between these two categories is Net Interest Expense or Net Interest Income. Analyzing relative valuation for banks and insurance companies can be somewhat more complex, as discussed in Copeland, Koller, and Murrin (2000, Chapters 21 and 22). Generally speaking, it is usually desirable that the numerator and denominator of a valuation metric should be consistent with each other (Damodaran, 2006, pp. 239-240).

## Industry-Specific Multiples

## HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE

Suppose that an analyst is seeking to gauge whether Company A is attractive or unattractive on the basis of relative valuation methods. Suppose that the analyst has determined that there are six other listed companies in the same industry which are approximately the same size, and which are also comparable in terms of product mix, client base, and geographical focus. Based on this information, the analyst can calculate some potentially useful multiples for all seven companies. A hypothetical table of such results is shown in Table 1. (For the purposes of this simple hypothetical example, we are assuming that all the firms have the same fiscal year. We will consider calendarization later in this entry.)


In this hypothetical scenario, Company A is being compared to Companies B through G, and therefore Company A should be excluded from the calculation of median and standard deviation, which would otherwise lead to double-counting. The median is used because it tends to be less influenced by outliers than the statistical mean, so it is likely to be a better estimate for the central tendency. (Similarly, the standard deviation can be strongly influenced by outliers, and it would be possible to use "median absolute deviation" as a more robust way of gauging the spread around the central tendency. Such approaches may be particularly appropriate when the data contain one or a handful of extreme outliers for certain metrics, which might be associated with company-specific idiosyncrasies.) The table has been arranged in terms of market

cap, from largest to smallest, which can sometimes reveal patterns associated with larger or smaller firms, though there don't appear to be any particularly obvious trends in this particular set of hypothetical numbers.

The table suggests that the chosen universe of comparable companies may be reasonably similar to Company A in several important respects. In terms of size, Companies B, C, and D are slightly larger, while Companies E, F, and G are slightly smaller, but the median market cap across the six firms is the same as Company A's current valuation. In terms of P/E ratios, Company A looks slightly cheap in terms of FY0 earnings and somewhat cheaper in terms of FY1 earnings. In terms of P/FCF ratios, Company A looks somewhat expensive in terms of FY0 free cash flow, but only slightly expensive in terms of FY1 free cash flow. And finally, in terms of P/B ratios, Company A looks somewhat expensive in terms of FY0 book value, but roughly in line with its peers in terms of FY1 book value.

## Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis

When attempting to use relative valuation methods on firms with multiple lines of business, the analyst may not be able to identify any company that is directly similar on all dimensions. In such instances, relative valuation methods can be extended to encompass "sum-of-the-parts" analysis, which considers each part of a business separately and attempts to value them individually by reference to companies that are mainly or solely in one particular line of business (see Hooke, 2010, Chapter 18).

Relative valuation analysis based on sum-of-the-parts approaches will involve the same challenges as were described above—identifying a suitable universe of companies engaged in each particular industry, collecting and collating the necessary data, and then using the results to gauge what might be a "fair value" for each of the individual lines of business. But in addition to these considerations, there is an additional difficulty, which is specific to sum-of-the-parts analysis. This problem is whether to apply a conglomerate discount, and if so, how much.

Much financial theory assumes that all else equal, investors are likely to prefer to invest in companies that are engaged in a single line of business, rather than to invest in conglomerates that have operations across multiple industries. Investing in a conglomerate effectively means being exposed to all of that conglomerate's operations, and the overall mix of industry exposures might not mimic the portfolio that the investor would have chosen if it were possible instead to put money into individual companies.

A possible counterargument might be that a conglomerate with strong and decisive central control may achieve synergies with regard to revenues, costs, or taxation that would not be available to individual free-standing firms dealing at arms' length with one another. A skeptical investor might wonder, on the other hand, about whether the potential positive impact of such synergies may be partly or wholly undermined by the negative impacts of centralized decision making, transfer pricing, and regulatory or reputational risk.


For these reasons, an analyst might consider that it is reasonable to apply a discount to the overall value that emerges from the "sum of the parts." Some practitioners favor a discount of somewhere between  $5\%$  and  $15\%$ , for the reasons given above. Academic research on spinoffs has suggested that the combined value of the surviving entity and the spun-off firm tends to rise by an average of around  $6\%$ , though with a wide range of variation (see Burch and Nanda, 2003). (Some analysts have suggested that in some particular contexts, for instance in markets where competent managers are very scarce, then investors should be willing to pay a premium for being able to invest in a conglomerate that is fortunate enough to have such executives. However, this appears not to be a mainstream view.)
