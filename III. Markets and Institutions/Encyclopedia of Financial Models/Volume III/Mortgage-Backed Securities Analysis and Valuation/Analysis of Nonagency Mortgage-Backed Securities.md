Abstract: The transformation of groups of mortgage loans with common attributes into tradable and liquid MBS occurs using one of two mechanisms. Loans that meet the guidelines of the agencies (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae) in terms of credit quality, underwriting standards, and balance are assigned an insurance premium (called a guaranty fee) by the agency in question and securitized as an agency pool. Loans that either do not qualify for agency treatment, or for which agency pooling execution is not efficient, can be securitized in nonagency or "private-label" transactions when such transactions are economically feasible. These types of securities do not have an agency guaranty, and must therefore be issued under the registration entity or "shelf" of the issuer. Although the analysis of private-label mortgage-backed securities utilizes many of the techniques employed to assess agency securities, the analysis must be extended in order to incorporate credit risk and adjust returns for expected principal losses, requiring additional analysis and metrics.

While the evaluation of private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) utilizes many of the techniques used in the evaluation of agency MBS (i.e., Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac MBS), the need to incorporate credit risk and adjust returns for expected principal losses requires additional analysis and metrics. The fact that the credit risk in these securities is not assumed by the government, either explicitly or implicitly, forces investors to evaluate and judge both the timing of the return of principal as well as the amount of principal, if any, that investors can expect to receive. Moreover, credit analysis has moved up what is called the credit stack. A major change stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis is that investors


can no longer assume that senior private-label mortgage-backed securities have virtually the same credit risk as agency MBS. Any bond that does not have agency credit support must be treated as a "credit piece" requiring the analysis of a variety of internal and external factors.

In this entry, we outline the various elements that drive the performance of nonagency MBS, and also examine the interactions of these factors. We then examine a useful framework for understanding the evolution of a population's credit profile and discuss a variety of techniques used to evaluate the credit risk and expected returns of private-label securities.

Before proceeding, it will be helpful to review a few concepts. Prepayments on nonagency securities must be classified based on their causation. Unlike agency securities, the return of principal to the securitization (or, more specifically, the investment trust) must be treated differently depending on whether it resulted from a voluntary action by the borrower or is forced by credit-related difficulties. Modeling the impact of voluntary prepayments is relatively straightforward; investors can assume that  $100\%$  of principal being prepaid will be returned on the next payment date. By contrast, projecting the impact of involuntary prepayments requires an estimate of both how much of every principal dollar prepaid will actually be paid to the investor, as well as when principal payments will be received by the trust.


# The Amount and Timing of Principal Return

Before proceeding, a brief discussion of terminology will be helpful. For private-label securities voluntary prepayments encompass traditional prepayment activity. Involuntary prepayments are credit-related prepayments that result from defaults or other events specifically related to credit events (such as short sales of homes), while also accounting for the likelihood that less than the full amount of principal will be returned to the transaction (or, more accurately, the trust holding the deal's collateral). Voluntary prepayments are typically quoted as VPRs, which stands for voluntary prepayment rate. They are calculated similar to a conditional prepayment rate (CPR), in which a monthly percentage of prepaid principal (sometimes denoted by VMM) is annualized. Involuntary prepayment speeds are quoted as conditional default rates  $(\mathrm{CDRs})^2$ , which are the annualized rate of default. CDRs are calculated by annualizing the monthly rate of default as a percentage of the current balance, or the MDR. The sum of the monthly VMMs and MDRs equals the total deal single monthly mortgage (SMM) rate for any particular month.

The issue of how much principal is projected to be received as a result of involuntary prepayments is a straightforward function of the assumed default rate and loss severity. Loss severities are simply the percentage of the defaulted principal that ultimately will not be returned to the investment trust. The inverse of loss severity is the recovery percentage.

The issues associated with the timing of principal return are more complex. Since the CDR is by definition the involuntary prepayment rate, a higher default rate assumes the faster return of at least some principal to investors. As a result, the faster return of principal to the trust due to higher default rates can offset the effects of principal loss. This effect is a function of the price of the security, the loss severity, and the tranche's position in the transaction's structure (i.e., under what circumstances the security will absorb losses).


In addition, the amount of time between when a default occurs and recovered principal is received by the trust (the lag) can have a major influence on investor returns, especially for bonds that are more junior in priority. A longer lag between the time of default and the receipt of recovered principal delays the writedown of the junior bond's principal value. This means that the investor may receive interest payments for a longer period of time, improving the value of securities for which the interest payments comprise the bulk of expected cash flows. In fact, lower-priority subordinates are sometimes referred to as credit IOs, since investors assume that no principal will be returned, and the only cash flows that they expect to receive are coupon payments. Since the outstanding principal is written off more slowly, investors holding the tranche receive a larger and longer stream of interest payments as the lag extends.

There are a variety of factors that influence the lag. Both the amount of seriously delinquent loans at a point in time and the actions of servicers play major roles in the timing of defaults and principal recoveries. The period after 2007, for example, saw a huge increase in the number of seriously delinquent loans outstanding. At the same time, servicers (i.e., the entities that process borrower payments and manage the foreclosure process) were unable to effectively manage the huge surge in problem loans. This resulted in an enormous backup in the foreclosure pipeline, and led to long lags between the time when loans stopped performing and the properties were liquidated.

Legal and political factors also impact lag times. Since real estate transactions are governed by state and local laws, there are differences in the timing of principal returns based on the state in which a loan resides. Some states, which are referenced as judicial states, require that a foreclosure be approved by a judge, which typically slows the foreclosure process. Foreclosures in nonjudicial states can be processed faster, resulting in shorter lags. Also, the foreclosure process itself can become a matter of controversy. In 2010, for example, problems with the legal documentation of foreclosure filings led to the suspension of foreclosure proceedings in some states, as well as calls for a national foreclosure moratorium.

Generally speaking, the amount and timing of cash flows to the trust are impacted by a variety of actions and decisions taken by both borrowers and servicers, and are also influenced by exogenous factors. We discuss how these behaviors can be understood and modeled later in this entry.

# Deal-Specific Factors

There are also a series of other subtle and obscure factors that can impact the cash flows and returns of nonagency securities. Some of these factors result from decisions by the servicer, while others vary depending on how an individual transaction's governing documents were written. These factors include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Servicers are required to advance principal and interest on delinquent loans. However, the governing documents of most deals state that the servicer is not required to advance any amount it deems "nonrecoverable" through the foreclosure process. The interpretation of "recoverability" depends on servicers' policies with respect to how long they will advance against seriously delinquent loans, along with the loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) of properties backing these loans. (Since expected recoveries are a function of the current LTV, servicers often will stop advancing on loans where the current LTV exceeds a certain threshold.)


- The treatment of "modified" loans (i.e., loans for which the terms were altered in order to help borrowers meet their obligations) within individual transactions was rarely outlined in deals issued prior to the mortgage crisis. For example, there have been controversies regarding whether "forborne" (i.e., deferred) principal resulting from loan modifications should be written off immediately (which typically benefits the senior bondholders in a transaction) or deferred until the point where principal losses are realized by the trust, which would result in more interest flowing to the subordinates.

- The allocation of losses due to principal and interest "shortfalls" can become highly complex and deal-specific, particularly once the subordinate bonds in an overcollateralization structure are paid off. For example, some deals (typically those issued before mid-2005) only allow for the balances of senior bonds to be reduced by payments actually made by borrowers. These structures can experience a phenomenon called "negative overcollateralization," which means that losses for the seniors are "implied." As a result, losses on the senior tranches are only realized when the collateral pool is entirely paid off and the trust is terminated with some bond balances still outstanding.

One conclusion that can be drawn is that investors in private-label MBS must have the will ingness and ability to read and understand the documents governing their holdings. Events and factors that were either not contemplated or were viewed as highly improbable can, under adverse conditions, become important in determining investor returns.


# UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF CREDIT PERFORMANCE WITHIN A TRANSACTION

As discussed previously, the actions and decisions taken by both borrowers and servicers, along with outside environmental factors, determine both the amount and timing of cash flows received by the trust. This behavior can be conceptualized through the use of transition matrices. Such matrices show the probability of loans moving from one credit status (or "state") to another in any month. This technique is often used as a foundation for formally modeling voluntary and involuntary speeds. We address it here, however, to help conceptualize the "life cycle" of a transaction's credit profile. The methodology offers useful techniques for demonstrating how the credit problems of obligors evolve into delinquencies and defaults and flow through a transaction over time. It is also useful in describing and quantifying how changes in the overall credit environment might impact the performance of a loan population.

Table 1 contains a hypothetical example of a roll matrix for a loan population, which can be defined either narrowly (e.g., for a single

transaction) or more broadly (to represent a particular product and vintage). The vertical axis of the matrix shows the current (or "from") states of the population, while the horizontal axis shows the future (i.e., "to") states of the loans, typically one month hence. The horizontal axis also allows for two additional states, which would represent termination of the loans either through "payoff" (i.e., prepaid voluntarily) or "liquidation" (involuntarily prepaid). Each row must sum to  $100\%$ , as every loan in the population at time zero must transition to some state in the following month.

The matrix itself can be created through a variety of techniques. In some cases, the matrix simply represents historical experience (over either a short- or long-term horizon), while other analysts use loan-level simulations to generate the matrix. Note that not all cells have values greater than zero, as some transitions are impossible; for example, a loan cannot go from current to 60-days delinquent without first residing in the 30-days delinquent bucket.

Once a transition matrix is created, it can be applied to the population's current profile (i.e., at time  $T_0$ ) as a means of projecting the population's credit performance in a future month. Table 2 illustrates the matrix math involved in generating the population's profile in month  $T_1$ , treating the  $T_0$  profile as a  $1 \times 7$  matrix shown in Table 2(A) to be multiplied times the  $7 \times 9$  transition matrix in Table 1. Table 2(B) shows the resulting profile one month hence (i.e., at time  $T_1$ ) after summing each column, along with the percentage of loans that drop out of the population through voluntary or involuntary prepayment. The remaining population profile is then normalized by dividing the percentages of remaining loans in each credit state (i.e., excluding loans that are paid off or liquidated) by the remaining percentage in the pool. (In the exhibit,  $98.8\%$  represents the portion of the population that remains active; the  $59.2\%$  of loans expected to be current in month  $T_1$  is divided by this percentage to get the  $59.9\%$  normalized total.)

The process can be performed iteratively in order to show how the population's profile can, given unchanged transition behavior, be expected to evolve over time. (This means that the profile at  $T_{1}$  can be multiplied by the transition matrix to generate a profile for time  $T_{2}$ , etc.) Figure 1 shows the projected profile of the population over the next 10 years by iteratively applying the transition matrix in Table 1 to the evolving population. The chart indicates that liquidated loans (i.e., loans that go into default and are removed from the pool through the foreclosure process) will comprise the largest single cohort in around three years if current transition probabilities hold. Moreover, two-thirds of the current population can be expected to be liquidated in 10 years.

The iterative calculation can also be used to generate projections for voluntary and involuntary prepayment speeds. VPR and CDR vectors can then be utilized in yield and cash flow calculators. Figure 2 shows the vectors generated by the analysis over 120 months.

Interestingly, the vectors are neither constant nor linear; note that the CDR vector increases fairly steadily for the first few years before leveling off around month 60. This pattern highlights the intrinsic nature of population transitions. Loans flow through the different credit states at varying rates that are a function of transition probabilities captured by the matrix. Therefore, the levels of VPRs and CDRs over time will vary even if transition activity is assumed to remain stable.


However, transition patterns normally do vary over time, reflecting changes in the economic and lending landscape as well as in the actions of servicers. The impact of changing behaviors can be captured by altering the transition matrix at a point in time. For example, a move on the part of servicers to more aggressively clean up the foreclosure pipeline would be captured in a transition framework by increasing the percentages in "late-stage" transitions (i.e., D90+ to FC, FC to REO, and REO to Liq) at a point in the future. Conversely, a full foreclosure moratorium (which was discussed in 2010) would be taken into account by changing all probabilities "from" the D90+, FC and REO buckets to zero for the expected length of the moratorium. Finally, improved borrower performance would be captured by increasing "cures," (i.e., D30 and D60 to Current) while decreasing the Current to D30 percentage. The updated matrix would be utilized at the point when the changes in behavior were expected to go into effect.

# THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING PRIVATE-LABEL MBS RETURNS

The analysis and valuation of private-label MBS is complicated by the need to project and account for a number of variables over and above those required to evaluate agency securities. As noted previously, the analysis requires additional metrics necessary to project the principal and interest cash flows paid to the trust, as well as how they will be allocated to the different tranches under a variety of scenarios.

The additional complexity associated with private-label MBS means that the dominant metric used to assess expected returns is loss-adjusted yield. This represents the internal rate of return (IRR) for a security's projected cash flows using the additional factors and variables discussed previously after adjusting for the normal MBS-specific issues such as payment frequency and delay. The increased complexity associated with the product means that some methodologies, such as total return analysis, are infrequently utilized in evaluating credit pieces. For example, total return requires the estimation of a terminal value at the horizon for each scenario being analyzed. The complexity involved in projecting future prices makes them, and thus the analysis, quite subjective.

In the following sections, we illustrate the technique described in this entry using a series of tranches, as well as the collateral, from a representative 2007-vintage hybrid ARM transaction. The three tranches examined include a super-senior (SS) tranche with  $24.2\%$  original credit support; a senior mezzanine (SM) tranche (i.e., a bond originally rated triple-A but junior in priority to the SS) with original credit support of  $5.25\%$ ; and a subordinate ("sub") bond or tranche that originally had  $3.85\%$  credit enhancement.

# Differentiating between Collateral and Tranche Losses

The various factors outlined above have interesting effects and interactions within individual transactions with respect to losses. For one thing, it is important to differentiate between losses on a deal's collateral pool (i.e., at the trust level) and those impacting individual bonds within a transaction. Private-label MBS have a variety of internal mechanisms that allocate cash flows and principal losses within the structure to tranches having different degrees of seniority. Therefore, losses absorbed by individual bonds are a function of both the losses absorbed by the trust and the amount of credit support available to them.

Figure 4 shows projected losses, as a percentage of original face, for both the overall collateral pool of the deal as well as the three tranches described above. Losses were calculated using different loss severity assumptions while assuming a constant  $4\%$  VPR and CDR. (These levels are hypothetical and used for illustrative purposes only.) While the line showing projected losses on the collateral has a linear upward slope, the profile of projected losses for the tranches are quite different. For example, the SS tranche suffers no losses until severities are greater than  $50\%$ , while the SM begins to experience losses at severities greater than  $40\%$ . The sub tranche, however, has a unique loss profile. It experiences no losses until severities exceed  $30\%$ , but at that point losses spike higher; virtually the entire principal value of the bond is written off once the assumed loss severity reaches  $45\%$ . The chart highlights a critical conclusion; in addition to being different from the collateral, each bond's exposure to losses is a function of its place in the transaction's capital structure.

# The Interaction of Credit Inputs

There are also a series of interesting observations that can be made by comparing the yields of the three bonds under a variety of scenarios.

Figure 4 Collateral and Bond Projected Losses at Different Loss Severities (assumption:  $4\%$  VPR,  $4\%$  CDR, 12-month lag)

For the purposes of the analysis, the bonds were all run at the hypothetical level of a  $10\%$  yield to assumptions of  $4\%$  VPR, a  $6\%$  CDR, a  $60\%$  loss severity, and a 12-month lag. (This resulted in prices of 64-12, 48-00, and 6-22 for the three securities.) Using those base-case prices, we ran a few representative scenarios in which different variables were altered, with the goal of ex ploring some of the subtleties of the different tranches' returns.


Figure 5 shows yields on the three securities calculated using different CDR projections, assuming a constant  $4\%$  VPR along with a  $60\%$  loss severity and a 12-month lag. The yield on the SS tranche remains fairly stable (and actually increases slightly until the CDR reaches

Figure 5 Projected Yields on Different Tranches Using Different CDR (assumption:  $4\%$  VPR,  $60\%$  severity, 12-month lag)

$6\%$ ). The reason for this behavior is that faster CDRs effectively increase the overall rate of prepayments to the SS tranche; however, the bond does not absorb losses until the  $6\%$  CDR level is breached due to its credit support. Given the tranche's highly discounted dollar price, the faster rate of prepayments increases its yield. By contrast, yields on the more junior tranches decline as CDRs are increased since both bonds realized losses once their limited credit support is exhausted.

The rate of voluntary prepayments also influences returns for some bonds in the transaction. Figure 6 shows projected yields on the three tranches at different assumed VPRs, using a constant  $6\%$  CDR (and, as before,  $60\%$  severity and a 12-month lag assumption). While their profiles partially reflect the impact of faster prepayments on bonds with deeply discounted prices, voluntary prepayments also have a subtle impact on nonagency MBS. When voluntary prepayments increase, principal is paid back to investors at  $100\%$  of face value. This means that there is less principal outstanding that can later go into default, even if the CDR and loss sever ity are held constant. As a result, yields for the senior tranches are influenced (and in the SM's case, strongly so) by the expected voluntary prepayment speed.


By contrast, the yield on the sub tranche class is insensitive to changes in the VPR assumption, in part as a result of its place in the deal's structure. (Subordinates generally don't receive voluntary prepayments in an overcollateralization structure unless the deal "steps down," which does not happen under these assumptions.) Its returns, however, are highly sensitive to the combination of assumptions used for CDRs, loss severities, and lags. In particular, the severity assumption plays a key role despite the fact that the bond does not receive principal under most scenarios. As a credit IO, the tranche's outstanding principal value serves as its notional value by dictating how much interest is paid to investors in any single month. Since the severity strongly influences how fast the tranche's face value is written off, it (along with the lag assumption) dictates how long the bond will remain outstanding and thus how much interest investors can expect to receive.

# Evaluating Available Credit Support

Before evaluating projected yields and cash flows for a tranche, a prudent step is to assess the security's remaining credit support relative to the expected level of losses. The objective is to evaluate whether a bond's remaining credit support (i.e., the amount and proportion of bonds junior in priority) is adequate given the losses that the transaction is expected to absorb. The following discussion outlines a simple yet useful methodology for gauging a security's credit support relative to expected losses by using its current performance profile.

The analysis begins by evaluating a transaction's capital structure. Table 3(A) shows the original and current credit structure of a deal.

While hypothetical, the deal's structure and profile is representative of transactions issued in 2006 and 2007.) The next step, shown in Table 3(B), uses a simple technique to estimate future cumulative losses for the transaction. Utilizing the current performance profile of the transaction, each performance cohort is assigned a probability of ultimate default, along with an assumed loss severity. The example uses a  $10\%$  estimate of ultimate default on current loans, a  $50\%$  estimate for loans that are D30, while  $100\%$  of loans that are seriously delinquent (D90, FC, and REO) are expected to ultimately default. (Note that loans in bankruptcy are not included in this calculation since they are generally captured in other

Each delinquency cohort is multiplied by its assigned percentages and the loss severity assumption; the sum of these figures represents the percentage of losses that the deal will ultimately be expected to absorb.


The final step is to divide each tranche's current credit support percentage by the transaction's total expected losses, as shown in Table 3(C). This coverage ratio measures how much credit support is available to each tranche if the expected losses are eventually realized. In the example, the  $76\%$  coverage ratio of the A1 tranche suggests that the bond is likely to experience significant future losses, despite its current sizeable cushion. Expected losses will probably also be large enough to eventually cause the other outstanding bonds in the capital structure (i.e., the A2 down to the M5) to be entirely written down.

While this analysis serves as a useful first step in evaluating individual tranches, it is limited by its simplistic approach. The default percentages assigned to each credit bucket are arbitrary, and also cannot account for changes in the credit environment. It also doesn't take into account the issue of time, that is, when losses will accrue and bonds will be written down. This limits its usefulness in evaluating credit IOs and more junior securities. Finally, the analysis doesn't take some forms of credit support, such as excess spread and insurance wraps, into account.

Despite its limitations, however, the methodology serves as a useful first step in evaluating the credit enhancement currently supporting a tranche. In addition, investors evaluating potential purchases of newer securities will find this and related techniques particularly helpful in evaluating both the adequacy of a bond's credit support and whether it is vulnerable to a downgrade by the rating agencies.

# Yield and Loss Matrix Analysis

As noted previously, the complexities associated with the product have made loss-adjusted yield the primary metric for evaluating and comparing credit-related MBS. However, standard yield matrices must be altered in order to account for the numerous additional inputs and outputs necessary to properly evaluate private-label MBS. The additional inputs include separate entries for voluntary and involuntary prepayments, along with the inclusion of expected loss severities, lags, and servicer advances. In some cases, the analysis must also account for the presence of insurance wraps and how long they might remain in place; expectations for how long servicers will continue to advance principal and interest; and whether the deal will pass its triggers (i.e., the tests that dictate cash flow distributions within individual transactions).


In addition, a number of additional outputs are necessary in order to assess a bond's value. In addition to average life, spreads, and durations, investors need to assess expected losses on both the tranche and the deal's collateral at different levels of the inputs. Also useful are the points in time, if applicable, that the bond will experience its first principal loss, along with the amount of liquidations and losses previously realized.

Table 4 contains examples of yield matrices that might be used to evaluate the super-senior and senior mezzanine tranches introduced in an earlier section. Table 4(A) and (B) shows tables for the SS (super senior) tranche and the senior mezzanine (SM) tranche, respectively, priced (as before) at a  $10\%$  loss-adjusted yield to a  $4\%$  VPR/6\% CDR base assumption. The tables in the exhibit show loss-adjusted yields and credit performance data for a range of CDRs, while holding the other variables (i.e., VPR, loss severity, and lag) constant. In addition to yields and average lives, the matrices show the durations, the dates of the first writedown, and the percentages of bond and collateral losses at the different CDR assumptions (which are the same for both tranches in this case).

However, the necessity of holding multiple inputs constant makes this format somewhat

For example, the tables would need to be recalculated multiple times in order to account for other assumptions for VPRs, loss severities, and lags. An alternative and somewhat more flexible scheme displays two variables as the axes, with yields and/or bond losses as the output (creating three-dimensional "surfaces" of yields and losses). Table 5 contains a matrix for the SM tranche showing VPRs on the vertical axis and CDRs on the horizontal, while holding the loss severity and lag assumptions constant. As with other forms of matrices, however, this format


is also limited to showing two variables at any one time. Additional matrices would need to be constructed in order to display different factors, depending on how relevant they were to the analysis.

# Model-Generated Analysis

The variables used in the above analysis can be generated in a variety of ways, depending on both investors' practices and the prevailing circumstances. During periods of relatively stable credit and housing performance, for example,

Alternatively, some investors may choose to utilize more sophisticated analysis, which can incorporate both the attributes of a deal's collateral along with exogenous economic and market variables. The models can be further incorporated into integrated systems that generate yield and loss figures while simultaneously analyzing and stratifying the collateral. Partial output from such an integrated system is shown in Table 6. The exhibit shows a yield matrix from Vichara Technology's system for the SS tranche. The matrix shows a variety of outputs at different multiples of the prepayment and default models, assuming unchanged home prices and interest rates. In addition, separate tables generated by the analysis (not shown) display the current credit structure of the deal, the tranche's cash flows, and analyses of the collateral. (The model also allows for the generation of a "credit OAS," although this metric is not widely utilized by investors at this writing due to its sensitivity to modeling error.)

Additional analysis can be generated for different home price appreciation (HPA) and interest rate assumptions. For example, a conservative set of assumptions might call for a 100 basis point parallel increase in rates accompanied by a  $10\%$  immediate decline in home prices. In addition, models for HPA that project different appreciation rates based on geographic and economic factors can also be utilized.

In the case of private-label securities, the normal challenge of assessing a model's "reasonableness" is complicated by the interactive nature of the variables. Unlike agency securities, where "model-equivalent CPRs" can be easily estimated (i.e., the bond's average life is iteratively calculated at various CPRs until it equals the model's calculated WAL), the division of prepayments into voluntary and involuntary categories means that a model- equivalent CDR cannot be calculated unless the VPR is held constant, and vice versa. This necessitates the need for additional output in order to view and judge the model's VPR and CDR projections.


# Interpreting the Outputs

The analysis and valuation of most securities (and virtually all fixed income investments) can be broadly summarized as assessing the "correct" level of expected returns given both market conditions and the bond's risks. This means that a number of factors need to be evaluated, including:

- The security's base-case yields and returns.
- Its returns in best- and worst-case scenarios.
- The likelihood of different scenarios being realized.

The relative complexity of analyzing private-label MBS, particularly compared to evaluating agency-backed securities, results from both the multiplicity of factors influencing returns as well as the many exogenous elements that drive these factors.

For example, a cursory evaluation of the yield matrix for the SM tranche (contained in Table 4(B)) indicates that the bond's projected yields decline rapidly as CDRs are increased. However, the matrix in Table 5 also shows that the tranche's yields remain relatively high if VPRs increase commensurately with CDRs (i.e., in the lower-right quadrant of the matrix). Alternatively, its projected yields are negative when higher CDRs are paired with lower VPRs (in the upper-right quadrant), while yields greater than  $20\%$  can be achieved with a combination of fast VPRs and slowing CDRs (the lower-left quadrant). If an investor decides that the combination of VPRs and CDRs in the upper-right quadrant represents a likely scenario, the negative yields projected for such scenarios indicates that the base-case yield assumption is too low to compensate investors for the risks being accepted.

Utilizing just these two variables, the analysis requires investors to assess the returns of

scenarios, taking the availability and adequacy of credit support into account. The sensitivity of the bond's returns to changes in other relevant factors must then be examined. As an example, expectations for real estate prices will directly impact expected loss severities, which will in turn affect an investor's willingness to buy securities that are more junior in priority. Another example relates to the state of the foreclosure pipeline and its influence on lags. During much of 2009 and 2010, the backup in the foreclosure pipeline meant that buying credit IOs, which benefited from the extended lag, was a profitable strategy as long as servicers continued to advance P&I.


The most difficult aspect of the analysis is generating expectations for factors that are difficult or impossible to quantify. The previous example of the value of credit IOs serves as an example. In addition to the dearth of significant information from servicers (who treat much of the information as having proprietary value), certain factors simply defy quantification. In addition, investors must continuously check their analysis to be certain that they understand what factors are driving their results. This means that the sort of analyses performed earlier in this entry (particularly in the section describing the interaction of factors) is highly useful in developing intuitions for how bonds can be expected to perform under varying conditions.

Note that this entry's discussions were focused on the evaluation of legacy bonds, that is, private-label MBS issued in the period prior to mid-2007. The techniques described in this entry, however, can also be used to evaluate newly issued securities, although some adjustments to the methodologies might need to be made. Investors analyzing the adequacy of credit support using the "coverage ratio" methodology demonstrated in Table 3, for example, would need to replace the use of a transaction's current credit profile with alternative ways of predicting future losses.

Finally, noticeably absent from these discussions were any mention of the rating agencies. Bond ratings cannot and should never substitute for rigorous analysis, as investors that experienced the post-2007 credit meltdown can attest. Ratings are relevant mainly due to constraints and restrictions on the holdings of regulated investors; when bond holdings are downgraded to below investment grade, many investors are forced to liquidate them, causing their prices to crater. Techniques similar to the coverage ratios outlined previously can be used to monitor the adequacy of bonds' credit support and identify bonds that are vulnerable to being downgraded.


# KEY POINTS

- In the analysis of agency MBS, since the government backing of these securities eliminates investors' exposure to principal writedown, the focus is on estimating the timing of principal cash flows.
- Private-label securities require layers of additional analysis because of the introduction of a series of additional factors that determine the bond's cash flows and thus their projected returns. These factors can be broadly characterized as (1) the amount of principal expected to be returned, (2) the timing of principal returns, and (3) the allocation of principal within the transaction.
- The issue of how much principal is projected to be received as a result of prepayments is a straightforward function of the assumed default rate and loss severity. Loss severity is measured as the percentage of the defaulted principal that will ultimately not be returned to the investment trust and of this measure is the recovery percentage.
- The amount and timing of cash flows to the trust are impacted by a variety of actions and decisions taken by both borrower and servicers, and are also influenced by exogenous factors.
- The analysis and valuation of private-label MBS is complicated by the need to project and account for a number of variables over and above those required to evaluate agency securities, requiring additional metrics necessary to project the principal and interest cash flows paid to the trust, as well as how they will be allocated to the different tranches, under a variety of scenarios.

- The additional complexity associated with private-label MBS means that the dominant metric used to assess expected returns is loss-adjusted yield.
- Before evaluating projected yields and cash flows for a tranche, a prudent step is to assess the security's remaining credit support relative to the expected level of losses. The objective is to evaluate whether a bond's remaining credit support (i.e., the amount and proportion of bonds junior in priority) is adequate given the losses that the transaction is expected to absorb.
- The relative complexity of analyzing private-label MBS, particularly compared to evaluating agency-backed securities, results from both the multiplicity of factors influencing returns as well as the many exogenous elements that drive these factors. The most difficult aspect of the analysis is generating expectations for factors that are difficult or impossible to quantify.
