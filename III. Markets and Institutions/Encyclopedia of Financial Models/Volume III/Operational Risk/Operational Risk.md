Abstract: At one time the belief was that financial institutions are exposed to two main risks. Operational risk was regarded as a mere part of "other" risks. That view has changed. This risk is now viewed as a major risk faced by financial institutions as the world financial system has been shaken by a number of banking failures since the mid 1980s, and the risks—that internationally active banks, in particular, have had to deal with—have become more complex and challenging. More than 100 operational losses exceeding \$100 million in value each and a number of losses exceeding \$1 billion have impacted financial firms globally since the end of the 1980s. There is no question that the cause is unrelated to market or credit risks. Such large-scale losses have resulted in bankruptcies, mergers, or substantial equity price declines of a large number of highly recognized financial institutions.

A long-held belief is that credit risk and market risk have been considered the two largest contributors to the risks faced by financial entities such as banks, insurance companies, and asset management firms. Credit risk is the risk of counterparty failure; market risk is the loss due to changes in market indicators, such as equity prices, interest rates, and exchange rates. It is now recognized that operational risk is a major risk faced by financial entities. In general terms, operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. This risk encompasses legal risks, which includes, but is not limited to, exposure to fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements.

Operational losses have been reflected in banks' balance sheets for many decades. Operational risk affects the soundness and operating efficiency of all banking activities and all business units. Most of the losses are relatively small in magnitude—the fact that these losses are frequent makes them predictable and often preventable. Examples of such operational losses include losses resulting from accidental accounting errors, minor credit card fraud, or equipment failures. Operational risk-related events that are often more severe in the magnitude of incurred loss include tax noncompliance, unauthorized trading activities, major internal fraudulent activities, business disruptions due to natural disasters, and vandalism.

Until around the 1990s, the latter events have been infrequent, and even if they did occur, banks were capable of sustaining the losses without major consequences. This is quite understandable because the operations within the banking industry until about the middle of the 1980s have been subject to numerous restrictions, keeping trading volumes relatively modest and diversity of operations limited. Therefore, the significance of operational risk (whose impact is positively correlated with income size and dispersion of business units) has been perceived as minor, with limited effect on management's decision making and capital allocation when compared to credit risk and market risk. However, serious changes in the global financial markets have caused noticeable shifts in banks' risk profiles.

Let's begin by distinguishing operational risk from other categories of financial risk. Operational risk is, in large part, a firm-specific and nonsystematic risk. $^{1}$  Early publications of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) defined operational risk as: $^{2}$

- Other risks.
- "Any risk not categorized as market and credit risk."
- "The risk of loss arising from various types of human or technical errors."

Other definitions proposed in the literature include:

- Risk "arising from human and technical errors and accidents."3
- "A measure of the link between a firm's business activities and the variation in its business results."4
- "The risk associated with operating a business."5

The formal definition that is currently widely accepted was initially proposed by the British Bankers Association (2001) and adopted by the BIS in January 2001. Operational risk was defined as "the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events."

The industry responded to this definition with criticism regarding the lack of a clear definition of "direct" and "indirect" losses. A refined definition of operational risk dropped the two terms, hence finalizing the definition of operational risk as:

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. (BIS, 2001b, p. 2)

This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk (these will be defined soon). The definition is "causal-based," providing a breakdown of operational risk into four categories based on its sources: (1) people, (2) processes, (3) systems, and (4) external factors. According to Barclays Bank, the major sources of operational risk include operational process reliability, IT security, outsourcing of operations, dependence on key suppliers, implementation of strategic change, integration of acquisitions, fraud, error, customer service quality, regulatory compliance, recruitment, training and retention of staff, and social and environmental impacts.[6]

Large banks and financial institutions sometimes prefer to use their own definition of operational risk. For example, Deutsche Bank defines operational risk as potential for incurring losses in relation to employees, contractual specifications and documentation, technology, infrastructure failure and disasters, external influences and customer relationships.7

The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi defines operational risk as "the risk of incurring losses that might be caused by negligence of proper operational processing, or by incidents or misconduct by either officers or staffs."[8]

In October 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defined operational risk as: the risk of loss due to the breakdown of controls within the firm including, but not limited to, unidentified limit excesses, unauthorized trading, fraud in trading or in back office functions, inexperienced personnel, and unstable and easily accessed computer systems.9

## Operational Risk Exposure Indicators

The probability of an operational risk event occurring increases with a larger number of personnel (due to increased possibility of committing an error) and with a greater transaction volume. Examples of operational risk exposure indicators include:10

- Gross income.
- Volume of trades or new deals.
- Value of assets under management.
- Value of transactions.
- Number of transactions.
- Number of employees.
- Employees' years of experience.
- Capital structure (debt to equity ratio).
- Historical operational losses.
- Historical insurance claims for operational losses.

For example, larger banks are more likely to have larger operational losses. Shih, Samad-Khan, and Medapa (2000) measured the dependence between a bank size and operational loss amounts. They found that, on average, for every unit increase in a bank size, operational losses are predicted to increase by roughly a fourth root of that. This means that when they regressed log-losses on a bank's log-size, the estimated coefficient was approximately 0.25. In a different study, Chapelle, Crama, Hubner, and Peters (2005) estimated the coefficient to be 0.15.

## Classification of Operational Risk

Operational risk can be classified according to

- The nature of the loss: internally inflicted or externally inflicted.
- The impact of the loss: direct losses or indirect losses.
- The degree of expectancy: expected or unexpected.
- Risk type, event type, and loss type.
- The magnitude (or severity) of loss and frequency of loss.

We discuss each one below.

## Internal versus External Operational Losses

Operational losses can be either internally inflicted or result from external sources. Internally inflicted sources include most of the losses caused by human, process, and technology failures, such as those due to human errors, internal fraud, unauthorized trading, injuries, business delays due to computer failures, or telecommunication problems. External sources include man-made incidents such as external fraud, theft, computer hacking, terrorist activities, and natural disasters such as damage to physical assets due to hurricanes, floods, and fires.

Many of the internal operational failures can be prevented with appropriate internal management practices; for example, tightened controls and management of the personnel can help prevent some employee errors and internal fraud, and improved telecommunication networks can help prevent some technological failures.

External losses are very difficult to prevent. However, it is possible to design insurance or other hedging strategies to reduce or possibly eliminate externally inflicted losses.

## Direct versus Indirect Operational Losses

Direct losses are the losses that directly arise from the associated events. For example, an incompetent currency trading can result in a loss for the bank due to adverse exchange rate movements. As another example, mistakenly charging a client \$50,000 instead of \$150,000 results in the loss for the bank in the amount of 100,000. The Basel II Capital Accord sets guidelines regarding the estimation of the regulatory capital charge by banks based only on direct losses. Table 1 identifies the Basel II Capital Accord's categories and definitions of direct operational losses.

Indirect losses are generally opportunity costs and the losses associated with the costs of fixing an operational risk problem, such as near-miss losses, latent losses, or contingent losses.

## Near-Miss Operational Losses

Near-miss losses (or near-misses) are the estimated losses from those events that could potentially occur but were successfully prevented. The rationale behind including near-misses into internal databases is as follows: The definition of "risk" should not be solely based on the past history of actual events but instead should be a forward-looking concept and include both actual and potential events that could result in material losses. The mere fact that a loss was prevented in the past (be it by luck or by conscious managerial action) does not guarantee that it will be prevented in the future. Therefore, near-misses signal flaws in a bank's internal system and should be accounted for in internal models. It is also possible to view near-misses from quite the opposite perspective: The ability to prevent these losses before they happen demonstrates the bank's effective operational risk management practices. Therefore, the losses that would result had these events taken place should not be included in the internal databases.

Muermann and Oktem (2002, p. 30) define near-miss as: an event, a sequence of events, or an observation of unusual occurrences that possesses the potential of improving a system's operability by reducing the risk of upsets some of which could eventually cause serious damage.

They assert that internal operational risk measurement models must include adequate management of near-misses.

Muermann and Oktem propose developing a pyramid-type three-level structure for the near-miss management system: corporate level, branch level, and individual level. At the corporate level within every bank, they propose

Table 1 Direct Loss Types and Their Definitions According to the Basel II Capital Accord

<table><tr><td>Loss Type</td><td>Contents</td></tr><tr><td>Write-downs</td><td>Direct reduction in value of assets due to theft, fraud, unauthorized activity, or market and credit losses arising as a result of operational events</td></tr><tr><td>Loss of recourse</td><td>Payments or disbursements made to incorrect parties and not recovered</td></tr><tr><td>Restitution</td><td>Payments to clients of principal and/or interest by way of restitution, or the cost of any other form of compensation paid to clients</td></tr><tr><td>Legal liability</td><td>Judgements, settlements, and other legal costs</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory and compliance</td><td>Taxation penalties, fines, or the direct cost of any other penalties, such as license revocations</td></tr><tr><td>Loss of or damage to assets</td><td>Direct reduction in value of physical assets, including certificates, due to an accident, such as neglect, fire, and earthquake</td></tr></table> establishing a Near-Miss Management Strategic Committee whose primary functions would include:

Source: BIS (2001a), p. 23, with modifications.

- Establishing guidelines for corporate and site near-miss structures.
- Developing criteria for classification of near-misses.
- Establishing prioritizing procedures for each near-miss class.
Auditing the near-miss system.
- Integrating quality and other management tools into near-miss management practice.
- Identifying gaps in the near-miss management structure based on analysis of incidents with higher damage (beyond near-misses) and taking corrective actions.
- Developing guidelines for training site management and employees on near-miss system.

At the branch level, they propose establishing a Near-Miss Management Council for every business unit. The key responsibilities of the council would include:

Adapting criteria set by Near-Miss Management Strategic Committee to the branch practices.
Monitoring site near-miss practices.
- Promoting the program.
- Ensuring availability of necessary resources for analysis and corrective action, especially for high priority near-misses.
Periodically analyzing reported near-misses for further improvement of the system.
- Training employees on NM implementation.

Finally, a successful near-miss management system relies on the individual actions by managers, supervisors, and employees. Appropriate training is necessary to recognize operational issues before they become a major problem and develop into operational losses for the bank.

## Expected versus Unexpected Operational Losses

Some operational losses are expected, some are not. The expected losses are generally those that occur on a regular (such as every day) basis, such as minor employee errors and minor credit card fraud. Unexpected losses are those losses that generally cannot be easily foreseen, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and large-scale internal fraud.

# Operational Risk Type, Event Type, and Loss Type

Confusion arises in the operational risk literature because of the distinction between risk type (or hazard type), event type, and loss type. When banks record their operational loss data, it is crucial to record it separately according to event type and loss type, and correctly identify the risk type.[11] The distinction between the three is comparable to cause and effect:[12]

- Hazard constitutes one or more factors that increase the probability of occurrence of an event.
Event is a single incident that leads directly to one or more effects (e.g., losses).
- Loss constitutes the amount of financial damage resulting from an event.

Thus, hazard potentially leads to event, and event is the cause of loss. Therefore, an event is the effect of a hazard while loss is the effect of an event.

Figure 1 illustrates the mechanism of operational loss occurrence. The following example, adopted from Mori and Harada (2001), further illustrates how the correct identification of the "event type" is critical in determining whether a loss of a particular "loss type" is attributed to market, credit, or operational risk.

Consider the following example:

- A reduction in the value of a bond due to a change in the market price.

- A reduction in the value of a bond due to the bankruptcy of the issuer.
- A reduction in the value of a bond due to a delivery failure.

In this example, the write-down of the bond (the loss type) belongs to the scope of market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, respectively. Accurate documentation of operational risk by the type of hazard, event, and loss is also essential for an understanding of operational risk.


The Basel II Capital Accord classifies operational risk into seven event-type groups (see

Table 2) and six operational loss types (see Table 1).

## Operational Loss Severity and Frequency

We have already stated that expected losses generally refer to the losses of low severity (or magnitude) and high frequency. Generalizing this idea, operational losses can be broadly classified into four main groups:

1. Low frequency/low severity.
2. High frequency/low severity.
3. High frequency/high severity.
4. Low frequency/high severity.

The idea is illustrated in the top half of Figure 2.

According to Samad-Khan (2005), the third group is implausible. More precisely, he suggests classifying each of the frequency and severity of operational losses into three groups: low, medium, and high. This creates a $3 \times 3$ matrix of all possible "frequency/severity" combinations. He states that "medium frequency/high severity," "high frequency/medium severity," and "high frequency/high severity" losses are unrealistic.

Recently, the financial industry also agreed that the first group is not feasible. Therefore, the two remaining categories of operational losses that the financial industry needs to focus on are "high frequency/low severity" and "low severity/high frequency" losses. The idea is illustrated in the bottom half of Figure 2.

The losses of "high frequency/low severity" are relatively unimportant for an institution and can often be prevented. What poses the greatest damage is the "low frequency/high severity" losses. Banks must be particularly attentive to these losses as these cause the greatest financial consequences to the institution, including potential bankruptcy. $^{13}$  Just a few of such events may result in bankruptcy or a significant decline in the market value of the bank. Therefore, it is critical for banks to be able to capture such losses in their internal risk models.

## Key Points

- Financial institutions bear various operational losses on a daily basis. Examples are losses resulting from employee errors, internal and external fraud, equipment failures, business disruptions due to natural disasters, and vandalism.
- Credit risk and market risk had been perceived as the two biggest sources of risk for financial institutions. Operational risk has been regarded as a mere part of "other" risks. Failures of major financial entities have made market participants aware of the importance of this risk.
- Operation risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. This definition identifies operational risk as coming from four major causes: processes, human, systems, and external factors.
- Operational risk can be classified according to several principles: nature of the loss (internally inflicted or externally inflicted), direct losses or indirect losses, degree of expectancy (expected or unexpected), risk type, event type or loss type, and by the magnitude (or severity) of loss and the frequency of loss.
- Operational risk can be the cause of reputational risk, a risk that can occur when the market reaction to an operational loss event results in reduction in the market value of a bank that is greater than the amount of the initial loss.

## Notes

1. However, operational risk is not entirely idiosyncratic. Two recent studies—Allen and Bali (2007) and Chernobai, Jorion, and Yu (2011)—found evidence of the effect of macroeconomic factors on operational risk in banks.
