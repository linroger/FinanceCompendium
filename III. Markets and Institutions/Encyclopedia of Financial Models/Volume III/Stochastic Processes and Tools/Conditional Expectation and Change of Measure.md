## Abstract

The current price of an option is obtained by the conditional expectation of the payoff function under the risk-neutral measure. The risk-neutral measure is the measure equivalent to the real market measure under which the discounted price process of the underlying stock becomes a martingale. In the Black-Scholes model, the risk-neutral measure can be obtained by the Girsanov theorem. The Esscher transform has been used to find the risk-neutral measure for the continuous Lévy process models. The general theory of the Esscher transform is applied to find the risk-neutral measure under tempered stable Lévy process models.

In this entry, we present some issues in stochastic processes. We begin by defining events of a probability space mathematically, and then discuss the concept of conditional expectation. We then explain two important notions for stochastic processes: martingale properties and Markov properties. The former relates to the fair price in a market and the latter describes the efficiency of a market. Finally, "change of measures" for processes are discussed. Change of measures for tempered stable processes are important for determining no-arbitrage pricing for assets. Further details about no-arbitrage pricing with the change of measure is discussed in Rachev et al. (2011).

## Events, $\sigma$-Fields, and Filtration

A set of possible outcomes in a given sample space  $\Omega$  is called an event. An event is mathematically defined as a subset of  $\Omega$ . If we have one event  $A$ , then the set of outcomes that are not included in  $A$  is also an event. For example, if we consider an event that the return of the stock of Disney tomorrow will be positive, then the set of outcomes that Disney's return tomorrow will be negative is also an event. Moreover, if we have two events  $A$  and  $B$ , then a set of outcomes included in both  $A$  and  $B$  is also an event. For instance, consider two events, the first event being that Disney's stock return tomorrow will be positive, and the other event that IBM's stock return tomorrow will be positive. Then a set of outcomes that both stock returns will be positive tomorrow is an event.

The class of events is described mathematically by the $\sigma$-field. The $\sigma$-field, denoted by $\mathcal{F}$, is the class of the subsets of $\Omega$ that satisfy the following properties:

Property 1.  $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$  and  $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$ .

Let  $\mathcal{G}$  denote a class of subsets contained in  $\Omega$ . Then the smallest  $\sigma$ -field containing  $\mathcal{G}$  is referred to as the  $\sigma$ -field generated by  $\mathcal{G}$ , and is denoted by  $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ . For a given random variable  $X$ , consider the class  $\mathcal{G} = \{A \subseteq \Omega : A = X^{-1}(I)\}$ , for all open interval  $I$  in  $\mathbb{R}\}$ , where  $X^{-1}$  is the inverse image of  $X$ . Then the  $\sigma$ -field generated by  $\mathcal{G}$  is referred to as the  $\sigma$ -field generated by  $X$ , and denoted by  $\sigma(X)$ . If there is a  $\sigma$ -field  $\mathcal{F}$  such that  $\sigma(X) \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ , then we say that  $X$  is  $\mathcal{F}$ -measurable.

The probability  $\mathbf{P}$  is a map from a given  $\sigma$ -field  $\mathcal{F}$  to the unit interval [0, 1]. If  $A \subseteq N \in \mathcal{F}$  and  $P(N) = 0$ , then the set  $A$  is referred to as a null set with respect to  $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})$ . Let  $\mathcal{N}$  be the class of all null sets with respect to  $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})$ . The space  $(\Omega, \tilde{\mathcal{F}}, \tilde{\mathbf{P}})$  is referred to as a comple- tion of  $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})$  if  $\tilde{\mathcal{F}} = \sigma(\mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{N})$  and  $\tilde{\mathbf{P}}(A \cup N) = \mathbf{P}(A)$  for all  $A \in \mathcal{F}$  and  $N \in \mathcal{N}$ . All probability spaces in this entry are assumed to be completions of spaces, that is, all null sets are contained in given  $\sigma$ -fields, and probabilities are defined on completed  $\sigma$ -fields.


Let $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be a sequence of $\sigma$-field with continuous index $t\geq 0$ (or discrete index $t = 0,1,2,\dots$). If $\mathcal{F}_s\subseteq \mathcal{F}_t$ for all $0\leq s\leq t$, then $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is referred to as a filtration. $\mathcal{F}_t$ can be interpreted as the "information" available to all market agents at time $t$. The filtration describes increasing information for time $t$.

Consider a stochastic process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$. If $X_{t}$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t\geq 0$, then $X$ is referred to as a $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$-adapted process. If $X_{t}$ is $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$ measurable for all discrete index $t = 0,1,2,\dots$ then $X$ is referred to as a $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$-predictable process.

For a given process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ we can generate a filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ by

$$
\mathcal{F}_{t} = \sigma(X_{s}; 0 \leq s \leq t)
$$

where $\sigma(X_s; 0 \leq s \leq t)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-field containing all $\sigma(X_s)$ with $0 \leq s \leq t$. Then the process $X$ is $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$-adapted and this filtration is referred to as a filtration generated by $X$.


## Conditional Expectation

The conditional expectation is a value of the expectation of a random variable under some restricted events. Let $g$ be a Borel function, $X$ be a random variable on a space $(\Omega, \mathbf{P})$ with $E[g(X)] < \infty$, and $A$ be an event. The conditional expectation $E[g(X)|A]$ is defined by

$$
E[g(X)|A] = \frac{E[g(X) 1_A]}{P(A)}
$$

where

$$
1_A(\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & \text{if } \omega \notin A \\ 1 & \text{if } \omega \in A. \end{array} \right.
$$

Consider a Borel function $g$, a stochastic process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ adapted to filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$. We can define the conditional expectation on $\mathcal{F}_t$ as a random variable. That is, the conditional expectation $E[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t]$ for $t \leq T$ is a random variable, such that

$$
E[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t](\omega) = E[g(X_T)|A_{\omega}], \quad \omega \in \Omega
$$

where $A_{\omega}$ is the smallest event in $\mathcal{F}_t$ with $\omega \in A_{\omega}$, or $A_{\omega} = \cap_{\omega \in B_{\omega} \in \mathcal{F}_t} B_{\omega}$. Moreover, if $g$ and $h$ are Borel functions, and $0 \leq s \leq t \leq T \leq T^{*}$, then we have the following properties:


- $E[g(X_t)|\mathcal{F}_0] = E[g(X_t)]$ where $\mathcal{F}_0 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$.
- $E[E[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t]|\mathcal{F}_s] = E[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_s]$.
- $E[g(X_t)h(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t] = g(X_t)E[h(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t]$.
- $E[ag(X_T) + bh(X_{T^*})|\mathcal{F}_t] = aE[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t] + bE[h(X_{T^*})|\mathcal{F}_t]$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.

We write $E[g(X_T)|X_t]$ instead of $E[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t]$ when $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(X_t)$. Hence we have:

- $E[E[g(X_T)|X_t]|X_s] = E[g(X_T)|X_s]$.
- $E[g(X_t)h(X_T)|X_t] = g(X_t)E[h(X_T)|X_t]$.
- $E[ag(X_T) + bh(X_{T^*})|X_t] = aE[g(X_T)|X_t] + bE[h(X_{T^*})|X_t]$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.

If a $(\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ satisfies the condition

$$
E[g(X_T)|\mathcal{F}_t] = E[g(X_T)|X_t]
$$

for all $0 \leq t \leq T$ and Borel function $g$, then the process $X$ is referred to as a Markov process.


In finance, a Markov process is used to explain the efficient market hypothesis. Suppose  $X$  is a price process of an asset, and consider a forward contract on the asset with maturity  $T$ . The  $\sigma$ -field  $\mathcal{F}_t$  contains all market information until time  $t$ . Hence,  $F_t = E[X_T | \mathcal{F}_t]$  is the expected price of the forward contract based on the information up to  $t$ . If the market is efficient, all information until  $t$  is impounded into the current price  $X_t$ . Hence, the expected price of the forward contract can be obtained by  $F_t = E[X_T | X_t]$ .

If a $(\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ satisfies the condition

$$
X_t = E[X_T|\mathcal{F}_t]
$$

for all $0 \leq t \leq T$, then the process $X$ is referred to as a martingale process. The process $X = (X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with $X_t = \sigma W_t$ is a martingale process, where $\sigma > 0$ and $(W_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is the standard Brownian motion. Since $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, we have

$$
E[X_T|\mathcal{F}_t] = E[X_T - X_t + X_t|\mathcal{F}_t] = E[X_T - X_t|\mathcal{F}_t] + X_t
$$

Since $X$ has stationary and independent increments,

$$
E[X_T - X_t|\mathcal{F}_t] = E[X_T - X_t] = E[X_{T-t}] = E[\sigma W_{T-t}] = 0
$$

Hence the process $X$ is a martingale.

In finance, a martingale process describes the fair price or no-arbitrage price for an asset. For example, consider one share of a stock and a forward contract that required delivery of one share of that stock to the forward contract holder at the maturity date. Suppose  $(S_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  is a stock price process and  $(F_{t})_{0\leq t\leq T}$  is the price process for the forward contract with maturity  $T$ . The forward price at time  $t < T$  is given by the conditional expectation of  $S_{T}$  based on the information until time  $t$ , that is,  $F_{t} = E[S_{T}|\mathcal{F}_{t}]$ . Moreover, we can see that  $F_{t} = S_{t}$  for all  $t$  with  $0\leq t\leq T$  by the following argument. Suppose  $F_{t} > S_{t}$ . Then we obtain the difference  $F_{t} - S_{t} > 0$  at time  $t$  by purchasing one share of the stock at price  $S_{t}$  and selling the forward contract at price  $F_{t}$ . We invest the proceeds in a money market account with interest rate  $r$ . At time  $T$ , by delivering the stock to the holder of the forward contract, we will then have  $e^{r(T - t)}(F_t - S_t)$ , which is an arbitrage profit. If  $F_{t} > S_{t}$ , then another arbitrage opportunity can be found by selling (i.e., shorting) one share of the stock and purchasing the forward contract. Therefore, to eliminate arbitrage opportunities,  $F_{t}$  should be equal to  $S_{t}$ ; that is, the stock price process should be a martingale.

## Change of Measures

In this section, we will present change of measure for random variables and Lévy processes. Change of measure is an important method to determine no-arbitrage prices of assets and derivatives.


### Equivalent Probability Measure

Consider two probability measures $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ on a sample space $\Omega$ and $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{F}$. If they satisfy the condition

$$
\mathbf{Q}(A) = 0 \Rightarrow \mathbf{P}(A) = 0,
$$

then we say that $\mathbf{P}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathbf{Q}$, and denote $\mathbf{P} \ll \mathbf{Q}$. Moreover, if $\mathbf{P} \ll \mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{Q} \ll \mathbf{P}$, that is,

$$
\mathbf{Q}(A) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{P}(A) = 0,
$$

then we say that $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ are equivalent.


If $\mathbf{Q} \ll \mathbf{P}$, then there exists a positive random variable $\xi$ with $\int_{\Omega} \xi d\mathbf{P} = 1$ and

$$
\mathbf{Q}(A) = \int_{A} \xi \, d\mathbf{P} \tag{1}
$$

for any $A \in \mathcal{F}$. In this case, $\xi$ is referred to as the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and denotes

$$
\xi = \frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{d\mathbf{P}}
$$

Conversely, if there is a positive random variable $\xi$ with $\int_{\Omega} \xi d\mathbf{P} = 1$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ is defined by equation (1), then $\mathbf{Q}$ is also a probability measure and $\mathbf{Q} \ll \mathbf{P}$.

Let $X$ be a random variable on a probability measure $\mathbf{P}$, and $f(x) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \mathbf{P}(X \leq x)$ be the probability density function (p.d.f.) of $X$. Suppose $\mathbf{Q}$ is a probability measure and the probability density function of $X$ on $\mathbf{Q}$ is given by $g(x) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \mathbf{Q}(X \leq x)$. If $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ are equivalent, then the Radon-Nikodym derivative is equal to

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{d\mathbf{P}} = \frac{g(X)}{f(X)}
$$

For example, $X \sim N(0, 1)$ is normally distributed on $\mathbf{P}$. If we take the Radon-Nikodym derivative by

$$
\xi_{1} = \frac{e^{\frac{-(x - \mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}} / \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}{e^{-\frac{x^{2}}{2}} / \sqrt{2\pi}},
$$

then the measure $\mathbf{Q}_1$ defined by $\mathbf{Q}_1(A) = \int_A \xi_1 d\mathbf{P}$ for $A \in \mathcal{F}$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{P}$ and $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ on the measure $\mathbf{Q}_1$. On the other hand, if we take the Radon-Nikodym derivative by

$$
\xi_{2} = \frac{h(X)}{e^{-\frac{X^{2}}{2}} / \sqrt{2\pi}}
$$

where

$$
h(x) = \frac{\sigma}{\pi ((x - \mu)^{2} + \sigma^{2})}
$$

which is the probability density function of the Cauchy distribution, then the measure $\mathbf{Q}_2$, defined by $\mathbf{Q}_2(A) = \int_A \xi_2 d\mathbf{P}$ for $A \in \mathcal{F}$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{P}$ and $X \sim S_1(\sigma, 0, \mu)$ on the measure $\mathbf{Q}_2$.


Consider a finite discrete process $(X_{t})_{t\in \{1,2,\dots,T\}}$ of independent and identically distributed (IID) real random variables on both probability measures $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$, where $T$ is a positive integer. By the independent property of the process on $\mathbf{P}$, we have

$$
\mathbf{P}[X_{1} \in \mathbb{R}, \dots, X_{t-1} \in \mathbb{R}, X_{t} < x, X_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}, \dots, X_{T} \in \mathbb{R}] = \mathbf{P}[X_{1} \in \mathbb{R}] \dots \mathbf{P}[X_{t-1} \in \mathbb{R}] \cdot \mathbf{P}[X_{t} < x] \cdot \mathbf{P}[X_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}] \dots \mathbf{P}[X_{T} \in \mathbb{R}] = \mathbf{P}[X_{t} < x]
$$

By the same argument, we have

$$
\mathbf{Q}[X_{1} \in \mathbb{R}, \dots, X_{t-1} \in \mathbb{R}, X_{t} < x, X_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}, \dots, X_{T} \in \mathbb{R}] = \mathbf{Q}[X_{t} < x]
$$

Since $X_{t}$'s are identically distributed on $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$, respectively, we have $\mathbf{P}[X_t < x] = \mathbf{P}[X_s < x]$ and $\mathbf{Q}[X_t < x] = \mathbf{Q}[X_s < x]$ for all $t, s \in \{1, 2, \dots, T\}$. Suppose that for all $t \in \{1, 2, \dots, T\}$ the probability density functions of $X_t$ are given by $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ on probability measures $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$, respectively. That is

$$
f(x) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \mathbf{P}[X_{t} < x]
$$

and

$$
g(x) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \mathbf{Q}[X_{t} < x]
$$

If the domain of the function $f$ is the same as the domain of the function $g$, then $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ are equivalent and the Radon-Nikodym derivative is equal to

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{d\mathbf{P}} = \frac{g(X_{1}) g(X_{2}) \cdots g(X_{T})}{f(X_{1}) f(X_{2}) \cdots f(X_{T})}
$$

However, that method cannot be used for either continuous-time processes or infinite-discrete processes. In the next section, we discuss the change of measure for continuous-time processes using Girsanov's theorem and the extended Girsanov's theorem.

## Change of Measure for Continuous-Time Processes

A continuous-time process is a function from the sample space to the set of appropriate functions. Hence, the change of measure for processes is more complex than the change of measure for a random variable.

Brownian motion is a function from the sample space to the set of continuous functions. For Brownian motion, we can find an equivalent measure using the following theorem, which is referred to as Girsanov's theorem:

**Theorem 1.** Let $W = (W_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ be a standard Brownian motion under measure $\mathbf{P}$ and $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be a filtration generated by $W$. Consider a process $(\xi_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ defined by

$$
\xi_{t} = e^{-\theta W_{t} - \frac{\theta^{2}}{2} t}
$$

Then the probability measure $\mathbf{Q}$ given by

$$
\mathbf{Q}(A)|_{\mathcal{F}_{t}} = \int_{A} \xi_{t} d\mathbf{P}, \quad A \in \mathcal{F}_{t}
$$

is equivalent to $\mathbf{P}|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$ for all $t\geq 0$, and the process $\tilde{W} = (\tilde{W}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with $\tilde{W}_{t} = \theta t + W_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion under the measure $\mathbf{Q}$.


Girsanov's theorem shows how stochastic processes change under the change of measure. For example, let a process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ be an arithmetic Brownian motion under measure $\mathbf{P}$ such that

$$
X_{t} = \mu t + \sigma W_{t}
$$

where $(W_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ is the standard Brownian motion. The process $X$ is not martingale on the measure $\mathbf{P}$, but we can obtain a measure where $X$ is a martingale by Girsanov's theorem. Indeed, we define a measure $\mathbf{Q}$ equivalent to $\mathbf{P}$ such that

$$
\mathbf{Q}(A)|_{\mathcal{F}_{t}} = \int_{A} e^{-\frac{\mu W_{t}}{\sigma} - \frac{\mu^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}} t} d\mathbf{P}, \quad A \in \mathcal{F}_{t}
$$

Then the process $X$ becomes $X_{t} = \sigma \tilde{W}_{t}$ with $\tilde{W}_t = \frac{\mu t}{\sigma} + W_t$ and the process $(\tilde{W}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion on the measure $\mathbf{Q}$. Therefore, the process $X$ is a martingale on the measure $\mathbf{Q}$.

A Lévy process is a function from the sample space to the set of right continuous functions with left limits at any point of the domain.[^2] Girsanov's theorem can be extended for Lévy processes by the following theorem:

**Theorem 2.** Suppose a process $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ is a Lévy process with Lévy triplets $(\sigma^2,\nu,\gamma)$ under measure $\mathbf{P}$. If there is a real number $\theta$ satisfying $\int_{|x|\geq 1} e^{\theta x} \nu(dx) < \infty$, then we can find the equivalent measure $\mathbf{Q}$ whose Radon-Nikodym derivative is given by

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{d\mathbf{P}}|_{\mathcal{F}_{t}} = \xi_{t} = \frac{e^{\theta X_{t}}}{E_{\mathbf{P}}[e^{\theta X_{t}}]} = e^{\theta X_{t} - l(\theta) t}
$$

where $l(\theta) = \log E_{\mathbf{P}}[e^{\theta X_1}]$. That is,

$$
\mathbf{Q}(A)|_{\mathcal{F}_{t}} = \int_{A} \xi_{t} d\mathbf{P}, \quad A \in \mathcal{F}_{t}
$$

is equivalent to $\mathbf{P}|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$ for all $t\geq 0$. Moreover, the process $X$ is a Lévy process with Lévy triplets $(\sigma^2,\tilde{\nu},\tilde{\gamma})$ under the measure $\mathbf{Q}$, where $\tilde{\nu}(dx) = e^{\theta x} \nu(dx)$ and $\tilde{\gamma} = \gamma + \int_{|x|\leq 1} x(e^{\theta x} - 1) \nu(dx)$.


The change of measure using Theorem 2 is referred to as the Esscher transform. The most general theorem of change of measure for Lévy processes is given by the following theorem (see Sato, 1999):

Theorem 3. Suppose a process  $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  has Lévy triplets  $(\sigma^2,\nu ,\gamma)$  and  $(\tilde{\sigma}^2,\tilde{\nu},\tilde{\gamma})$  under measures  $\mathbf{P}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}$ , respectively.

1. In the case where  $\sigma^2\neq 0$  and  $\tilde{\sigma}^2\neq 0$ $\mathbf{P}|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$  are equivalent for all  $t > 0$  if and only if the Lévy triplets satisfy


$$
\sigma^{2} = \tilde {\sigma}^{2} > 0 \tag {2}
$$ and


$$
\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \left(e^{\psi (x) / 2} - 1\right)^{2} v (d x) <   \infty \tag {3}
$$ where  $\psi (x) = \ln \left(\frac{d\bar{\nu}}{dv}\right)$ .


2. In the case where  $\sigma^2 = \tilde{\sigma}^2 = 0$ ,  $\mathbf{P}|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$  are equivalent for all  $t \geq 0$  if and only if the Lévy triplets satisfy (3) and

$$
\tilde {\gamma} - \gamma = \int_{| x | \leq 1} x (\tilde {v} - v) (d x) \tag {4}
$$

When  $\mathbf{P}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}$  are equivalent, the Radon-Nikodym derivative is

$$
\left. \frac{d \mathbf {Q}}{d \mathbf {Q}} \right|_{\mathcal {F}_{t}} = e^{\xi t}
$$ where  $\xi = (\xi_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  is a Lévy process with Lévy triplet  $(\sigma_{\xi}^{2},\nu_{\xi},\gamma_{\xi})$  given by


$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \sigma_{\xi}^{2} = \sigma^{2} \eta^{2} \\ v_{\xi} = v \circ \psi^{- 1} \\ \gamma_{\xi} = - \frac{\sigma^{2} \eta^{2}}{2} - \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} \left(e^{y} - 1 - y 1_{| y | \leq 1}\right) v \xi (d y) \end{array} \right. \tag {5}
$$ and  $\eta$  is such that


$$
\tilde {\gamma} - \gamma - \int_{| x | \leq 1} x (\tilde {v} - v) (d x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \sigma^{2} \eta & i f \sigma > 0 \\ 0 & i f \sigma = 0 \end{array} \right.
$$

# Change of Measure in Tempered Stable Processes

In this section, we present the change of measure for six tempered stable processes: the classical tempered stable (CTS) process, Kim-Rachev tempered stable (KRTS) process, modified tempered stable (MTS) process, normal tempered stable (NTS) process, and rapidly decreasing tempered stable (RDTs) process. The six processes are defined as follows:

- Let  $\alpha \in (0,2), C, \lambda_{+}, \lambda_{-} > 0$ , and  $m \in \mathbb{R}$ . A Lévy process  $(X_{t})_{t \geq 0}$  is referred to as the classical tempered stable (CTS) process if the charac teristic function of  $X_{t}$  is given by


$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi_{X_{\mathrm{t}}} (u) = \exp (i u m t - i u t C \Gamma (1 - \alpha) (\lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 1} - \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 1}) \\ + t C \Gamma (- \alpha) ((\lambda_{+} - i u)^{\alpha} - \lambda_{+}^{\alpha} \\ + \left(\lambda_{-} + i u\right)^{\alpha} - \left. \lambda_{-}^{\alpha}\right)) \\ \end{array}
$$

If we take a special parameter  $C$  defined by

$$
C = \left(\Gamma (2 - \alpha) \left(\lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 2} + 2 \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 2}\right)\right)^{- 1} \tag {6}
$$ and  $m = 0$  then  $E[X_{t}] = 0$  and  $\mathrm{V}(X_t) = t$ . In this case,  $X$  is called the standard CTS process with parameters  $(\alpha, \lambda_{+}, \lambda_{-})$ .


- A Lévy process  $(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  is referred to as the generalized tempered stable (GTS) process if the characteristic function of  $X_{t}$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi_{X_{t}} (u) = \exp (i u m t - i u t \Gamma (1 - \alpha) \left(C_{+} \lambda_{+}^{\alpha_{+} - 1} \right. \\ - C_{-} \lambda_{-}^{\alpha_{- - 1}}) \\ + t C_{+} \Gamma (- \alpha_{+}) \left(\left(\lambda_{+} - i u\right)^{\alpha_{+}} - \lambda_{+}^{\alpha_{+}}\right) \\ + t C_{-} \Gamma (- \alpha_{-}) ((\lambda_{-} + i u)^{\alpha_{-}} - \lambda_{-}^{\alpha_{-}})), \tag {7} \\ \end{array}
$$ where  $\alpha_{+},\alpha_{-}\in (0,1)\cup (1,2),C_{+},C_{-},\lambda_{+},\lambda_{-} > 0$  , and  $m\in \mathbb{R}$  . If we substitute

A Lévy process  $(X_{t})_{t \geq 0}$  is referred to as the Kim-Rachev (KR) process if the characteristic function of  $X_{t}$  is given by

$$
H (x; \alpha , r, p) = \frac{\Gamma (- \alpha)}{p} (_ {2} F_{1} (p, - \alpha ; 1 + p; r x) - 1)
$$ where  ${}_{2}F_{1}$  is the hypergeometric function. If  $p_{+}$  and  $p_{-}$  approach to the infinite, then the


KR process converges to the CTS process. If we substitute

$$ k_{+} = C \frac{\alpha + p_{+}}{r_{+}^{\alpha}}
$$

$$ k_{-} = C \frac{\alpha + p_{-}}{r_{-}^{\alpha}}
$$ where


$$
C = \frac{1}{\Gamma (2 - \alpha)} \left(\frac{\alpha + p_{+}}{2 + p_{+}} r_{+}^{2 - \alpha} + \frac{\alpha + p_{-}}{2 + p_{-}} r_{-}^{2 - \alpha}\right) - 1 \tag {9}

If we substitute

$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi X_{t} (u) = \exp \left(i u m t + i u t 2^{- \frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} C \sqrt{\pi} \Gamma \left(- \frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \right. \\ \times \alpha \beta (\lambda^{2} - \beta^{2})^{\frac{\alpha}{2} - 1} + 2^{- \frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} t C \sqrt{\pi} \Gamma \left(- \frac{\overline {{\alpha}}}{2}\right) \\ \times \left(\left(\lambda^{2} - (\beta + i u)^{2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} - \left(\lambda^{2} - \beta^{2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right) \\ \end{array}

$$ and  $M$  is the confluent hypergeometric function. See Andrews (1998). If we take a special parameter  $C$  defined by


$$
C = 2^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \left(\Gamma \left(1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \left(\lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 2} + \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 2}\right)\right)^{- 1} \tag {12}
$$ and  $m = 0$  then  $E[X_{t}] = 0$  and  $V(X_{t}) = t$ . In this case,  $X$  is called the standard RDTS process with parameters  $(\alpha, \lambda_{+}, \lambda_{-})$ .


The six tempered stable processes are pure jump Lévy processes with Lévy triplet  $(0, \nu, \gamma)$ , where  $\gamma = m - \int_{|x| > 1} x\nu(dx)$  and Lévy measures are presented in Table 1.

Let  $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  be one tempered stable process among the six tempered stable processes. Then  $E[X_{t}] = mt$  and  $X$  has stationary and independent increments. Therefore, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left[ X_{T} \mid \mathcal {F}_{t} \right] = E \left[ X_{T} - X_{t} \mid \mathcal {F}_{t} \right] + X_{t} \\ = E \left[ X_{T - t} \right] + X_{t} = m (T - t) + X_{t} \\ \end{array}
$$ and hence  $X$  is a martingale when  $m = 0$ .


The properties of tempered stable processes change under the change of measure using the Esscher transform. For example, let a process  $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  be a symmetric CTS process under measure  $P$  (that is  $\lambda_{+} = \lambda_{-} = \lambda$ ). Then the Lévy measure  $\nu(dx)$  of  $X$  is given by

$$
\nu (d x) = C \left(\frac{e^{- \lambda x}}{x^{1 + \alpha}} 1_{x > 0} + \frac{e^{- \lambda | x |}}{| x |^{1 + \alpha}} 1_{x <   0}\right) d x
$$

Since we have  $\int_{|x|\geq 1}e^{\theta x}\nu (dx) < \infty$  for some real number  $\theta$  with  $-\lambda \leq \theta \leq \lambda$ , we can define a measure  $\mathbf{Q}$  equivalent to  $\mathbf{P}$  such that

$$
\mathbf {Q} (A) |_{\mathcal {F} t} = \int_{A} e^{\theta X_{t} - l (\theta) t} d \mathbf {P}, \quad A \in \mathcal {F}_{t}
$$ where


$$
\begin{array}{l} l (\theta) = \log E_{\mathrm{P}} \left[ e^{\theta X_{1}} \right] = C \Gamma (- \alpha) ((\lambda - \theta)^{\alpha} \\ + (\lambda + \theta)^{\alpha} - 2 \lambda^{\alpha}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Moreover, the Lévy measure  $\tilde{\nu} (dx)$  of  $X$  under  $\mathbf{Q}$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \tilde {v} (d x) = e^{\theta x} v (d x) \\ = C \left(\frac{e^{- (\lambda - \theta) x}}{x^{1 + \alpha}} 1_{x > 0} + \frac{e^{- (\lambda + \theta) | x |}}{| x |^{1 + \alpha}} 1_{x <   0}\right) d x \\ \end{array}
$$

By the same argument, we discuss the relation between the symmetric MTS and NTS process. That is, let a process  $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  be a symmetric MTS process under measure  $\mathbf{P}$ . Then the Lévy measure  $\nu(dx)$  of  $X$  is given by

$$
\nu (d x) = C (\lambda | x |)^{\frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} K_{\frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} (\lambda | x |) d x
$$

Since we have  $\int_{|x|\geq 1}e^{-\beta x}\nu (dx) < \infty$  for some real number  $\beta$  with  $-\lambda \leq \beta \leq \lambda$ , we can define a measure  $\mathbf{Q}$  equivalent to  $\mathbf{P}$  such that

$$
\mathbf {Q} (A) |_{\mathcal {F}_{t}} = \int_{A} e^{- \beta X_{t} - l (- \beta) t} d \mathbf {P}, \quad A \in \mathcal {F}_{t},
$$ where


$$
\begin{array}{l} l (x) = \log E_{\mathbf {P}} \left[ e^{x X_{1}} \right] \\ = C 2^{- \frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} \sqrt{\pi} \Gamma \left(- \frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \left(\left(\lambda^{2} + x^{2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} - \lambda^{\alpha}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Moreover, the Lévy measure  $\tilde{\nu} (dx)$  of  $X$  under  $\mathbf{Q}$  is given by

$$
\tilde {\nu} (d x) = e^{- \beta x} \nu (d x) = C e^{- \beta x} (\lambda | x |)^{\frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} K_{\frac{\alpha + 1}{2}} (\lambda | x |) d x
$$ which is the Lévy measure for the NTS process.

We can apply Theorem 3 to tempered stable processes. For example, let  $X = (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  be a CTS process with parameters  $(\alpha, C, \lambda_{+}, \lambda_{-}, m)$  on measure  $\mathbf{P}$  and a CTS process with parameters  $(\tilde{\alpha}, \tilde{C}, \tilde{\lambda}_{+}, \tilde{\lambda}_{-}, \tilde{m})$  on measure  $\mathbf{Q}$ . Then  $\mathbf{P}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}$  are equivalent if and only if  $C = \tilde{C}$ ,  $\alpha = \tilde{\alpha}$ , and

$$
\tilde {m} - m = C \Gamma (1 - \alpha) \left(\tilde {\lambda}_{+}^{\alpha - 1} - \tilde {\lambda}_{-}^{\alpha - 1} - \lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 1} + \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 1}\right) \tag {13}
$$

When  $\mathbf{P}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}$  are equivalent, the Radon-Nikodym derivative is  $\left.\frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{d\mathbf{P}}\right|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = e^{U_t}$  where  $U$ $= (U_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  is a Lévy process with Lévy triplet  $(\sigma_U^2,\nu_U,\gamma_U)$  given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_{U}^{2} = 0, \quad v_{U} = v \circ \psi^{- 1}, \\ \gamma_{U} = - \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} t \left(e^{y} - 1 - y 1_{| y | \leq 1}\right) \left(v \circ \psi^{- 1}\right) (d y) \tag {14} \\ \end{array}
$$

In equation (14),  $\nu$  is the CTS Lévy measure given by

$$
\nu (d x) = C \left(\frac{e^{- \lambda_{+} x}}{x^{1 + \alpha}} 1_{x > 0} + \frac{e^{- \lambda_{-} | x |}}{| x |^{1 + \alpha}} 1_{x <   0}\right) d x
$$ and  $\psi (x) = (\lambda_{+} - \tilde{\lambda}_{+})x1_{x > 0} - (\lambda_{-} - \tilde{\lambda}_{-})x1_{x < 0}$ . Proofs can be obtained by Theorem 3, but we will not discuss the proofs here.


We can apply the same argument to the GTS, MTS, NTS, KRTS, and RDTs processes. The necessary and sufficient equivalent condition for change of measures for the six tempered stable distributions are presented in Table 2. Radon-Nikodym derivatives are omitted in the table.

By applying change of measures, we can obtain a martingale process from a CTS process. Let a process  $X^0 = (X_t^0)_{t\geq 0}$  be a CTS process with

Then  $X$  becomes the CTS process with parameters  $(\alpha, C, \lambda_{+}, \lambda_{-}, m)$  on the measure  $\mathbf{P}$ . The process  $X$  is not a martingale on the measure  $\mathbf{P}$ , but we can obtain a measure where  $X$  is a martingale by the change of measures for CTS processes. We assume that  $\tilde{\lambda}_{+}$  and  $\tilde{\lambda}_{-}$  are positive real numbers such that


$$
0 - m = C \Gamma (1 - \alpha) (\tilde {\lambda}_{+}^{\alpha - 1} - \tilde {\lambda}_{-}^{\alpha - 1} - \lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 1} + \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 1})
$$ and we define a measure  $\mathbf{Q}$  equivalent to  $\mathbf{P}$  such that


$$
\mathbf {Q} (A) \mid_{\mathcal {F}_{t}} = \int_{A} e^{U_{t}} d \mathbf {P}, \quad A \in \mathcal {F}_{t}
$$ where  $(U_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  is the Lévy process with Lévy triplet  $(\sigma_U^2,\nu_U,\gamma_U)$  given by equation (14). Then


the process  $X$  becomes the CTS process with parameters  $(\alpha, C, \tilde{\lambda}_{+}, \tilde{\lambda}_{-}, 0)$  on the measure  $\mathbf{Q}$ . Therefore, the process  $X$  is a martingale on measure  $\mathbf{Q}$ .

Furthermore, by applying change of measures to the standard CTS process, we obtain the following result. Let  $(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  be a standard CTS process with parameters  $(\alpha ,\lambda_{+},\lambda_{-})$  under a measure  $\mathbf{P}$ , and  $\tilde{\lambda}_{+},\tilde{\lambda}_{+} > 0$  and real number  $\mu$  satisfy the following:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{c} \lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 2} + \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 2} = \tilde {\lambda}_{+}^{\alpha - 2} + \tilde {\lambda}_{-}^{\alpha - 2} \\ \mu = \frac{\lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 1} - \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 1} - \tilde {\lambda}_{+}^{\alpha - 1} + \tilde {\lambda}_{-}^{\alpha - 1}}{(1 - \alpha) \left(\lambda_{+}^{\alpha - 2} + \lambda_{-}^{\alpha - 2}\right)} \end{array} \right. \tag {15}
$$

Then we can find a measure  $\mathbf{Q}$  equivalent to  $\mathbf{P}$  such that a process  $(Y_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  with  $Y_{t} = \mu t + X_{t}$  is a standard CTS process with parameters  $(\alpha ,\tilde{\lambda}_{+},\tilde{\lambda}_{-})$  under a measure  $\mathbf{Q}$ .

We apply the same argument to the standard GTS, standard MTS, standard NTS, standard KRTS, and standard RDTS processes. The relations of parameters between standard tempered stable process  $(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  under  $\mathbf{P}$  and standard tempered stable process  $(Y_{t})_{t\geq 0}$  with  $Y_{t} = \mu t + X_{t}$  under  $\mathbf{Q}$  are presented in Table 3.
