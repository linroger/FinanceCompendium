# Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility

The SPV will (i) purchase qualifying bonds as the sole investor in a bond issuance; and (ii) purchase portions of syndicated loans or bonds at issuance. The Reserve Bank will be secured by all the assets of the SPV. The Department of the Treasury will make a  \$75 billion equity investment in the SPV to support both the Facility and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility ("SMCCF"). The initial allocation of the equity will be\$ 50 billion toward the Facility and \$25 billion toward the SMCCF. The combined size of the Facility and the SMCCF will be up to \$750 billion.

Limits per Issuer: Issuers may approach the Facility to refinance outstanding debt, from the period of three months ahead of the maturity date of such outstanding debt. Issuers may additionally approach the Facility at any time to issue additional debt, provided their rating is reaffirmed at BB-/Ba3 or above with the additional debt by each major NRSRO with a rating of the issuer.

Eligible corporate bonds as sole investor. Pricing will be issuer-specific, informed by market conditions, plus a 100 bps facility fee. Pricing also will be subject to minimum and maximum spreads over yields on comparable maturity U.S. Treasury securities, and such spread caps and floors will vary based on an eligible issuer's credit rating as of the date on which the Facility makes a purchase.
