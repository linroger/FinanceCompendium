# Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility

Effective July 28,  $2020^{1}$

Facility: The TALF is a credit facility authorized under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act intended to help meet the credit needs of consumers and businesses by facilitating the issuance of asset-backed securities ("ABS") and improving the market conditions for ABS more generally. The TALF will serve as a funding backstop to facilitate the issuance of eligible ABS on or after March 23, 2020.

Under the TALF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("Reserve Bank") will commit to lend to a special purpose vehicle ("SPV") on a recourse basis. The Department of the Treasury, using funds appropriated to the Exchange Stabilization Fund under section 4027 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), will make an equity investment of $10 billion in the SPV.

The TALF SPV initially will make up to $100 billion of loans available. The loans will have a term of three years; will be nonrecourse to the borrower; and will be fully secured by eligible ABS.

Eligible Borrowers: Eligible borrowers include businesses that (a) are created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, (b) have significant operations in and a majority of their employees based in the United States, and (c) maintain an account relationship with a TALF Agent.

Eligible Collateral: Eligible collateral includes U.S. dollar denominated cash (that is, not synthetic) ABS that have a credit rating in the highest long-term or, if no long-term rating is available, the highest short-term investment-grade rating category from at least two eligible nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs") and do not have a credit rating below the highest investment-grade rating category from an eligible NRSRO. With the exception of commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), SBA Pool Certificates, and Development Company Participation Certificates, eligible ABS must be issued on or after March 23, 2020. CMBS issued on or after March 23, 2020, will not be eligible. SBA Pool Certificates or Development Company Participation Certificates must be issued on or after January 1, 2019.

To be eligible collateral, all or substantially all of the underlying credit exposures must be newly issued, except for CMBS.

All or substantially all of the credit exposures underlying the eligible ABS must (1) for newly issued ABS, except for collateralized loan obligations (Close), be originated by U.S.-organized entities (including U.S. branches or agencies of foreign banks), (2) for Close, have a lead or a co-lead arranger that is a U.S.-organized entity (including a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank), and (3) for all ABS (including Close and CMBS), be to U.S.-domiciled obligors or with respect to real property located in the United States or one of its territories.

Eligible collateral must be ABS where the underlying credit exposures are one of the following:

NaN. Auto loans and leases;  
NaN. Student loans;  
NaN. Credit card receivables (both consumer and corporate);  
NaN. Equipment loans and leases;  
NaN. Floorplan loans;  
NaN. Premium finance loans for property and casualty insurance;  
NaN. Certain small business loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration;  
NaN. Leveraged loans; or

# 9) Commercial mortgages.

Eligible collateral will not include ABS that bear interest payments that step up or step down to predetermined levels on specific dates. In addition, the underlying credit exposures of eligible collateral must not include exposures that are themselves cash ABS or synthetic ABS.

The feasibility of adding other asset classes to the facility or expanding the scope of existing asset classes will be considered in the future.

Conflicts of interest: Eligible borrowers will be subject to the conflicts of interest requirements of section 4019 of the CARES Act.

Restriction on single-asset single-borrower CMBS ("SASB CMBS") and commercial real estate Close ("CRE Close"): SASB CMBS and CRE Close will not be eligible collateral.

Restrictions on CLO loan substitution: Only static Close will be eligible collateral.

Collateral Valuation: Haircut schedule is below. The haircut schedule is consistent with the haircut scheduled used for the TALF established in 2008.

Pricing: For Close, the interest rate will be 150 basis points over the 30-day average secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"). For SBA Pool Certificates (7(a) loans), the interest rate will be the top of the federal funds target range plus 75 basis points. For SBA Development Company Participation Certificates (504 loans), the interest rate will be 75 basis points over the 3-year fed funds overnight index swap ("Is") rate.

For all other eligible ABS, the interest rate will be 125 basis points over the 2-year Is rate for securities with a weighted average life less than two years, or 125 basis points over the 3-year Is rate for securities with a weighted average life of two years or greater.

Fees: The SPV will assess an administrative fee equal to 10 basis points of the loan amount on the settlement date for collateral.

Maturity: Each loan provided under this facility will have a maturity of three years.

Non-Recourse: Loans made under the TALF are made without recourse to the borrower, provided the requirements of the TALF are met.

Prepayment: Loans made under the TALF will be pre-payable in whole or in part at the option of the borrower, but substitution of collateral during the term of the loan generally will not be allowed.

Program Termination: No new credit extensions will be made after December 31, 2020, unless the TALF is extended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Department of the Treasury.

* For auto, credit card, equipment, floorplan, and premium finance ABS, the weighted average life must be five years or less. For other new-issue eligible collateral, haircuts will increase by one percentage point for each additional year (or portion thereof) of average life beyond five years. For legacy CMBS with average lives beyond five years, base dollar haircuts will increase by one percentage point of par for each additional year (or portion thereof) of average life beyond five years. No securitization may have an average life beyond ten years.
