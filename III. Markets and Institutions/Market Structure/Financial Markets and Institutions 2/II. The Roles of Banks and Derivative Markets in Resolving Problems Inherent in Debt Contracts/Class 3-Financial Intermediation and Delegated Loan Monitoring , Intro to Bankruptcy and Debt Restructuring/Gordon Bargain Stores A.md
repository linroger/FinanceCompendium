# GORDON BARGAIN STORES, INC. (A)

"It's a damned awkward situation. Gordon Stores clearly needs a lot of bank support for the upcoming year - a lot more than we at Erie State Bank can supply. With the whole discount merchandising retail business running into some rough weather because of the recession in 1982, and with Gordon's own troubles, I can understand the other banks pulling out. But Gordon is no dog - after all, they've built up a net worth of over \$75 million, and we are only thinking of total bank debt of \$37.5 million, much of that seasonal. They've been a fine account for us, especially those deposit balances. There's got to be a solution here…"

With these thoughts central in his mind, Mr. George Farnham, Vice President of the Erie State Bank in Cleveland, Ohio, was grappling with the problems of an important customer, Gordon Bargain Stores, Inc. At the time, January 1984, Gordon operated a chain of 79 discount retail department stores located throughout Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania. Because of losses suffered by Kiddie-City, a chain of juvenile merchandise stores and a subsidiary of Gordon, the Company had not been able to pay off its  \$8,625,000 in short-term debt to Erie from its Christmas profits, as had been customary. Mr. Farnham had just received from Gordon forecasts of a break-even in earnings for the fiscal year ending on January 31, 1984, compared to a before-tax loss from continuing operations the previous year of\$ 1,258,000. The Company's disappointing, albeit improved, performance had caused Erie's New York correspondent bank, Knickerbocker, to withdraw from its \$14,375,000 participation as an overline in Erie's total line of credit of \$28,750,000 when it was paid off by the Company in December. Following Knickerbocker's lead, the Steel City National Bank in Pittsburgh had withdrawn its line of \$8,750,000. Gordon's short-term needs for 1984 were predicted to be approximately \$31,250,000. Since Erie's potential exposure of \$28,750,000 (as the New York correspondent had dropped its overline), substantially exceeded Erie's legal lending limit of \$17,250,000, it was critical that Mr. Farnham either find additional banks willing to lend to Gordon, or withdraw part or all of Erie's own proffered line of credit.

This case was prepared as a basis for class discussion and is not intended to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation.

(as the New York correspondent had dropped its overline), substantially exceeded Erie's legal lending limit of \$17,250,000, it was critical that Mr. Farnham either find additional banks willing to lend to Gordon, or withdraw part or all of Erie's own proffered line of credit.

As Exhibits 1 through 7 show, Gordon had an impressive record of growth and profitability through fiscal 1982, but it had not been invulnerable to the recession in the U.S. economy in 1982. The financial difficulties of Gordon were compounded to some extent by the much more severe economic problems for its customer base located in the coal-mining districts. Rumors of some discounters in the area experiencing severe financial difficulties caused concern among the trade suppliers and the factoring firms that bought the suppliers' trade receivables. Gordon's problems had "swept the trade," and Mr. Farnham, as the Account Officer for Gordon's lead bank, had been experiencing a near-deluge of calls from worried suppliers and factors seeking reassurance as to Gordon's future. Despite the passage of almost a decade, the bankruptcies of such major discount retailers as W.T. Grant, Giant, Arlan's, Interstate, and Kaylin's in the 1970s were still fresh in many of the trade's minds. It was evident that failure to develop a sound financing program--or to damp down the emotional concern--could lead important suppliers to cut off trade credit to Gordon.

# Gordon's Retail Market

The areas in which the Gordon Bargain Stores were located were fairly diverse economically, ranging from farming to mining to heavy industry. This region was especially hard hit by the deterioration of the U.S. economy in 1982. As the production of durable goods dropped precipitously in the first quarter of the year and continued to decline throughout 1982, assembly plants began to close as inventories grew, causing unemployment to jump. The effect rippled throughout the area's industries, such as rubber and steel, as demand slumped and prices increased. In the U.S. as a whole, real GNP dropped  $2.1\%$  in 1982 and unemployment rose steadily from  $7.5\%$  in 1981 to  $10.2\%$  by January 1983. A recovery began to take hold in early 1983. For all of 1983, real GNP grew at  $3.7\%$  and the unemployment rate dropped to  $7.9\%$  by January 1984. However, in the areas served by Gordon, the recovery was occurring with a significant lag. For example, in the coal mining regions, while unemployment was dropping, it still stood at close to  $15\%$  in early 1984.

The economic situation held especially dire possibilities for the markets in which Gordon operated, because the industry in this geographic area was unusually competi-

tive. Compared with the 1983 national average of 11,000 households per store, Gordon's markets were considerably "over-stored," with just over 9,000 households per store. Stores operating in this area achieved sales per square foot of only  \$85.00 in 1983, compared with the national average of\$ 99.00. Competition for consumers' dollars, which had always been strong, further intensified, leading to heavy advertising expenses and slashed markups. In addition, as the suppliers grew increasingly nervous, trade credit shortened, causing working capital to rise and profit margins to drop.

# Early History of Gordon Bargain Stores, Inc.

What was eventually to become one of the thirty largest retail discount chains in the United States got its start in 1958, when Mr. James A. Gordon opened a small Army-Navy store in North Canton, Ohio with \$3,000 in cash. This venture proved so successful that in the next seven years Gordon opened four more stores in nearby towns. In 1966, Mr. Gordon decided to expand the discount concept embodied in the Army-Navy stores to appeal to a broader market, and so he opened his first self-service discount department store in Canton "in order to provide quality merchandise at substantial savings." The new store, named "Gordon Bargains," offered a broad selection of merchandise, with emphasis on soft goods, especially wearing apparel, to appeal to the family of average income. Operations were strictly cash-and-carry. By 1972, Gordon had expanded his chain, now incorporated under the name Gordon Bargain Stores, Inc. to a total of six stores located in Eastern Ohio and Pittsburgh. He continued to emphasize soft goods which were  $50\%$  of sales. Concessionaires, operating departments such as cosmetics, jewelry, toys and luncheonettes, contributed approximately  $34\%$  of gross sales. Gordon strove for a "personal" approach to mass merchandising, using a fashion orientation and bright attractive stores with eye-catching displays. His goal was to create a strong Gordon image of great value and good quality in the minds of his customers through intensive selected advertising in local newspapers, TV and radio. The similarity of exterior design and interior layout in all of the Gordon stores, which were leased facilities in large shopping centers, further served to heighten consumers' awareness of the Gordon image.

During this early period of expansion, Jim Gordon had relied exclusively on small banks located near the Gordon Bargain stores for his financial needs which were mostly seasonal working capital. At this time, Mr. Gordon's primary banking relationship was with the North Canton Trust Company, his bank since opening his first store in 1958. By 1972, Mr. Gordon had established such a strong working relationship with the bank that its president, Mr. Mathew Campbell, served on

Gordon's Board of Directors. Gordon's borrowings amounted to  \$2,080,000 and were spread among seven banks in smaller Ohio cities. With plans to expand the number of Gordon Bargain Stores from six in 1972 to 13 by the end of 1975, it was obvious that the Company needed to consolidate its borrowings and to establish a relationship with a larger, more sophisticated bank which could both accommodate Gordon's burgeoning funding requirements and provide financial advice. As Mr. Campbell agreed that Gordon should expand its banking relationships, he introduced Mr. Gordon to his friend, George Farnham, at the Erie State Bank, North Canton Trust's Cleveland correspondent bank. Pleased by the prospect of acquiring a customer with a strong record of growth, good management, and sizeable borrowing needs for the future, Mr. Farnham carefully studied the financial data supplied to him by Mr. Gordon. Mr. Gordon requested a total commitment of\$ 3 million, of which \$1.5 million would be a five-year term loan to fund the expansion and the rest would be a line of credit for seasonal working capital needs. The loans would be used to pay off Gordon's existing borrowings and would be shared equally by Erie and North Canton Trust. After visiting two Gordon stores, as well as its new headquarters in a Cleveland suburb, Mr. Farnham agreed to the above request and opened an account for Gordon in November 1972.

Throughout the rest of the 1970's Erie's relationship with Gordon continued to strengthen until it became the Company's only lending bank. The account proved highly profitable for Erie, as Gordon's operations generated very high cash balances. Mr. Gordon's ties to the North Canton Trust had gradually fallen away, partially as a result of the distance of the new headquarters from North Canton, and partially due to Mr. Campbell's extremely conservative approach to Gordon's expansion, which ultimately led to his resignation as a director. Mr. Farnham got to know Mr. Gordon well, both because of their business ties and the fact that they lived in the same Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights. As Gordon expanded in size, Mr. Gordon's stature in the community also grew. He was named a director of one of the local colleges, and he became very active in several local and regional charities.

From the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, Gordon's gross sales increased by more than tenfold to \$229.8 million in the year ending January 31, 1980. Operations were made more profitable, as the Company gradually took over the previously leased departments, so that the concessionaires' contribution to gross sales declined to  $4\%$  from  $30\%$  in 1977. The number of stores rose from four at the beginning of the decade to 40 at its end. Aside from geographic expansion, the Company branched out into other markets with the acquisition in March 1980 of Kiddie-City, a chain of seven juvenile merchandise discount

stores, located in Pittsburgh and Eastern Ohio. David Gordon, Jim's son, was named President of the new division, which had a volume in 1979 of \$18.75 million and earnings of \$480,000.

Gordon's management was also expanded and developed through policies of internal promotion and thorough management training programs. Tight financial reporting and control systems were instituted, along with an advanced computer system to handle purchasing and distribution. A combined primary and secondary offering of shares to the public was successful in December 1974. Half the proceeds went to the Company and half to the Gordon family, who sold some of their own shares. Additional share offerings in 1978, 1980, and 1981 reduced the Gordons' holdings to just over  $17\%$  of the shares outstanding.

By the end of 1981, it became obvious that Gordon's projected 1982 borrowing needs of \$28.75 million could not be handled by Erie State Bank alone. Due to its excellent growth record and solid prospects, Gordon was being actively solicited as an account by several other Cleveland and Pittsburgh banks. While actively encouraging the addition of a second banking relationship, Mr. Farnham wanted to ensure Erie's continued status as Gordon's lead bank and its principal depositary. He suggested, therefore, that Erie double its present line of credit to \$28.75 million for seasonal, unsecured borrowings, at Erie's "Base Rate" (equivalent to the prevailing prime rate), and participate out half the amount under an overline from Erie's New York correspondent bank, Knickerbocker Trust Company. It was agreed that Gordon would not open a deposit account with the New York bank, as Erie's correspondent balances would be allowed to contribute to that bank's yield computation. It was further determined that longer term funds to finance the expansion of stores would be provided by the Mid-West Life Insurance Company. Mid-West had agreed to provide an additional \$28.75 million for 15 years at 10% to be repaid semiannually. Erie agreed to participate in this credit for \$5.75 million, taking the first three years' maturities, at a rate of prime plus 1/2%; these outstandings were to be deducted from Erie's total line of credit to Gordon (see Exhibit 10 for a schedule of interest rates in the U.S. during the early 1980s).

# Problems Begin at Gordon

By the spring of 1982, Gordon Bargain Stores had grown to a total of 74 stores and into Kentucky and West Virginia; this included the Kiddie City operations which had expanded from the seven original stores to 17. Unfortunately, under the management of Gordon's son, David, Kiddie-City had proven unprofitable to the extent that, for the first time, Gordon had

to report a  \$1,017,500 loss for the quarter ending April 29, 1982, compared with income of\$ 594,758 for the corresponding months of 1981. Despite this burden, Gordon opened 16 new stores in 1982 using the longer term funds provided by Mid-- West and Erie.

Gordon management was unable to return Kiddie-City to profitability and was forced to report a net loss of  \$2.7 million for the fiscal year ending on February 3, 1983. This figure included a\$ 7.25 million loss from Kiddie-City operations, as well as an extraordinary  \$4,000,000 write-down (\$ 2,000,000 net of recognized tax benefits) of all of the goodwill arising from the division's original acquisition. Mr. Gordon followed up his assurance that he was dealing with the problems by closing six of the Kiddie-City stores during the first half of 1983 and instituting negotiations to sell the remaining 11 stores. Through these actions, he was able to convince the Steel City National Bank in Pittsburgh, the lead bank for Kiddie-City prior to the acquisition, to extend a \$8.75 million unsecured line of credit at prime to supplement the existing \$28.75 million line from Erie and Knickerbocker. In addition, the Appalachia Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia, a regional depository for local Gordon stores, which had long solicited the Gordon account, extended a \$5.75 million seasonal credit line.

By late summer of 1983, more problems began to crop up. Some of the Gordon Bargain Stores were proving less profitable, as sales declined and inventory mounted. The Company found it necessary to draw down all its available seasonal lines of \(28.75 million simply to keep trade payables current. To add to Gordon's problems, the financial difficulties of several other discounters, caused concern to spread through the factors and credit insurance companies who handled the soft goods industry. The rumors of Gordon's problems with Kiddie-City severely damaged its credit with the trade, so that certain lines were cut back dramatically.

At a September 1983 meeting with representatives of the banks, Mr. Gordon presented operational forecasts for the year ending January 31, 1984. Sales were predicted to exceed  \$522.5 million, with a pre-tax profit of\$ 3.5 million and net income (after tax credits) of \$5.125 million. He reported that the last of the charge-offs associated with Kiddie-City had been taken, and that the remaining 11 stores were contributing a positive cash flow. He planned a trip to New York in the next few days with Gordon's Vice President-Finance and Treasurer to present the Company's case to the trade.

Although the concerns of the trade eased due to continued prompt payment by Gordon, by late December 1983, the

overall situation had worsened. Sales were running about 6% behind year-earlier levels, which implied breakeven results for the year rather than the \$3.5 million in pretax earnings forecast earlier. Cash generated from Christmas season sales had enabled the Company to pay off all its bank debt except \$14.375 million due Erie. In response to the Appalachia Bank's agreement to renew its line of \$5.75 million, Gordon immediately drew down the line. In January, however, shortly after being paid down, Erie's New York correspondent announced that it was withdrawing its \$14.375 million overline participation in Erie's total \$28.75 million line of credit. It explained that the bank was drastically reducing its exposure to the discount industry, after having suffered a sizeable loss on a recent bankruptcy. The Steel City National Bank refused to renew its \$8.75 million line of credit unless another New York bank could be brought into the arrangement. The Pittsburgh bankers felt that the presence of a strong New York bank with close ties to the soft goods trade was vital since Gordon simply could not long survive without adequate trade credit.

On January 18, Mr. Farnham met with Mr. Gordon and Gordon's Treasurer to discuss the problem of finding another New York bank. Mr. Gordon reported that in the 11 months ending December 31, 1983, Gordon had produced a net profit of approximately \$6.5 million. He forecast that Gordon would lose a considerable amount of money in January and planned to take markdowns in February to be applied against January operations. This would result in a net profit for the year ending January 31, 1984 of about \$862,500, unless inventory "shrinkage" (shortages from theft and bookkeeping errors) should prove to be greater than the historical rate of 1.8% which had been budgeted. Mr. Gordon stated that he knew of no reason why shrinkage should be greater than forecast. He brought with him cash flow projections for the year ending on January 31, 1984 which were based on budgeted levels (see Exhibit 9). Because Gordon's management was waiting for the final year-- end figures for 1984 before completing projections for fiscal 1985, Mr. Gordon did not have these with him. He did say, however, that operations were expected to follow the pattern of past years, although short-term funding requirements were predicted to decline somewhat to \$31.25 million as a result of closing the Kiddie-City stores. Together with the \$5.75 million which had been drawn down on a long-term basis under Erie's \$12.5 million line to fund Gordon's expansion, total bank debt needed in fiscal 1985 amounted to approximately \$37.5 million.

# Lease Commitments

All but one of the Company's stores are leased. The discount department store leases expire at various dates between the years 1985 and 2011 and generally have at least two 10-year extension options. The leases of juvenile merchandise stores expire at various dates between 1984 and 2005. Most leases provide for payment of property taxes and certain other expenses. One-third of the leases provide for additional rentals based on a percentage of sales. Many of the leases require that the Company operate a retail store on the premises in question, and many leases restrict the company from opening another discount department store within a certain radius without the consent of the lessor. The minimum rentals for the leases for future periods in effect at January 31, 1984 (not including the exercise of renewal options) are ($ in thousands):
