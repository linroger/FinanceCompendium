# Oaktree and the Restructuring of CIT Group (A)

On July 16, 2009, Rajath Shourie (HBS '00), Managing Director at Oaktree Capital Management – a large investor in the unsecured debt of New York-based lender CIT Group (CIT) – was evaluating the possibility of extending a \$3 billion credit facility to CIT together with five other large creditors of the struggling bank. Just a day earlier, CIT had been officially denied access to the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) program introduced in 2008 to provide guarantees on unsecured debt issued by qualifying financial firms. Most of the largest financial institutions in the country had used the TLGP to access low-cost funding during the financial crisis.

CIT's performance had started to deteriorate in mid-2007 when financial markets came under stress due to concerns about subprime lending and structured credit. The deterioration accelerated after concerns about the solvency of the banking system erupted into a full-blown banking panic following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. By mid-2009, CIT had been running at a net loss for nine straight quarters and had been unable to sell its corporate bonds – its primary source of funding – for more than a year. (See Exhibits 1 and 2.)

With over  \$2 billion of debt due before the end of the year and over\$ 4 billion due in the first half of 2010 (see Exhibit 3), CIT badly needed funding. As a result, CIT was negotiating with the investor group for a \$3 billion credit facility to meet short term funding needs. This would help CIT stay afloat until it could restructure the company. However, a more substantial restructuring of the company would require additional financing. The creditors had to decide whether to extend the loan and, if so, the terms on which they would do so.

# CIT Group

For much of the century since its founding in 1908, CIT provided loans and leases for heavy machinery, technology equipment, and other manufacturing durables.1 CIT pioneered consumer automobile financing in 1916, and then expanded into consumer installment loans for furniture and electric appliances.2 In 1928, CIT entered the factoring business.3 After World War II CIT continued to grow, acquiring not only financial services firms such as banks and insurers, but also manufacturers of greeting cards and office furniture.4 The ensuing decades were somewhat tumultuous for CIT, which in 1969 exited the auto financing business, emphasizing personal and home equity loans as well as equipment leasing. By 1977, CIT operated over 1,000 consumer finance offices. In 1980, RCA

Corporation purchased CIT, selling off its four manufacturing businesses before selling CIT to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corporation in 1984. The result was the world's largest factoring business, with \$8 billion in volume. (Exhibit 4 illustrates the basics of factoring.) CIT continued to grow its business in aircraft, equipment, and ship leasing.[5] CIT exited the consumer finance business by transferring the consumer loan portfolio to Manufacturers Hanover, which in 1989 sold  $60\%$  of CIT to Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.[6] During the 1990s the company grew its business financing unit, returning to the New York Stock Exchange in a 1997 IPO, and bought out Dai-ichi Kangyo Banks's remaining stake in 1998. In 1999, CIT bought the second-largest U.S. equipment financing and leasing firm.[7]

In 2003, Wall Street veteran Jeffrey M. Peek joined CIT as CEO after missing out on the top job at Merrill Lynch. Under Peek, CIT expanded into subprime mortgage and student lending, aggressively growing its balance sheet and boosting net income by nearly  $40\%$  by the end of 2006. In February 2007, its shares reached a record \$61.36, an increase of  $233\%$  relative to 2003 levels; over the same period, the S&P 500 index increased by  $75\%$ . But this performance came undone with the subprime meltdown and the freezing of securitization markets in mid-2007. At that point, CIT began a process of restructuring both its assets and liabilities to deal with the turmoil.

At the start of 2009, CIT divided its loan portfolio into five primary customer categories: corporate  $(32.2\%)$ , transportation  $(20.9\%)$ , vendor  $(19.1\%)$ , consumer  $(18.5\%)$ , and trade finance  $(8.9\%)$ . (Exhibit 5 shows managed assets by segment.) Most of these loans were secured by hard assets or receivables. Corporate finance consisted primarily of lending and leasing to small and medium-sized businesses. CIT's transportation financing included the third-largest U.S. railcar and third-largest global aircraft leasing operations. CIT's vendor financing partnered with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), dealers, and distributors to finance their office equipment leasing. CIT's trade financing operation was the leading provider of factoring services for both manufacturers and importers with roughly one million customers. These customers were as diverse as daycare centers, Dunkin' Donuts, and several National Hockey League teams, spanning 50 countries, though U.S. and Canadian customers accounted for  $80\%$  of CIT's assets.[9] It was roughly the size of the  $25^{\text{th}}$ -largest bank holding company in the United States. It also provided financing to a wide variety of industries.

# Response to the Credit Crisis

Unlike commercial banks, which were largely financed by customer deposits, CIT was a finance company, and as such, it primarily relied on capital markets to raise funds. Historically, nearly  $80\%$  of CIT's debt financing was mediumto long-term unsecured debt, with commercial paper issuance and secured non-recourse borrowing accounting for another  $15\%$ . Deposits at its Utah-based bank represented less than  $5\%$  of the company's funding. (See Exhibit 2.)

The outbreak of the subprime crisis in August 2007 raised concerns about the credit quality of financial institutions, including CIT. As a result, CIT found it more difficult to fund its operations in capital markets, and particularly in the commercial paper market. To make up for this shortfall, in the third quarter of 2007 CIT began relying more heavily on secured borrowing. By the end of 2007, roughly  $30\%$  of CIT assets were encumbered by secured borrowing.[10] In the first quarter of 2008, CIT drew down \$7.3 billion—the full amount available under four separate senior unsecured revolving

lines. $^a$  By June 2008, CIT was shut out of the commercial paper market when it lost its A1/P1 credit rating. To meet this funding shortfall, CIT arranged a \$3 billion secured loan from Goldman Sachs.

CIT also tried to raise cash by selling its troubled  \$9.3 billion home mortgage business. In July 2008, almost a year after CIT first announced its intention to exit the home mortgage lending business, it sold the business for\$ 1.8 billion and the assumption of \$4.4 billion in debt to Lone Star Funds, a private equity firm specializing in the purchase of distressed assets. But these steps would prove insufficient to deal with the full blown banking panic that erupted after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. CIT was under considerable financial stress, but because the firm funded itself on a more long-term basis, it had somewhat more breathing room than investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, which used considerable amounts of very short-term financing including overnight repurchase agreements (repo).

Nevertheless, in December 2008, CIT applied for and received a \$2.3 billion capital infusion from the U.S. Treasury Department as part of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) that had been established in October 2008 as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and alongside TLGP.[11] In exchange, the Treasury received preferred stock and warrants in the companies in which it had invested.[b] In order to qualify for the investment, CIT—which was previously was registered as a non-bank financial institution—had converted to a bank holding company. In conjunction, CIT agreed to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB)'s requirement that it maintain a total capital ratio of at least  $13\%$  of the risk-weighted assets. In normal circumstances, the FRB's total capital ratio guidelines required a bank to hold at least  $8\%$  capital on a risk-weighted basis. As of December 31, 2008 CIT's capitalization ratio was at  $13.1\%$ .[12]

On January 12, 2009 CIT applied for access to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which guaranteed the newly-issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and bank holding companies, though this guarantee was subject to some limits.[13] Access to the TLGP would enable CIT, which by then had a below-investment-grade credit rating, to sell bonds at a low interest rate.[14] CIT competitors, including GE Capital and GMAC (General Motors' financing arm), had already been accepted into the TLGP and were able raise debt financing at near-riskless rates.[15] If CIT was accepted into the program, it would eventually be able to issue up to \$12 billion of FDIC-guaranteed debt to replace its maturing debt. However, in order to qualify for TLGP, the FDIC had to determine that CIT was solvent and that its failure would pose a systemic risk to the financial sector.

As a major lender to small businesses—a part of the economy considered crucial to reviving employment levels and thereby lifting the U.S. out of the recession—the company argued that its collapse would put 760 manufacturers at risk and "precipitate a crisis" for 300,000 retailers.[16] However, the FDIC did not immediately let CIT into TLGP, and its performance worsened through the first half of 2009 as the economy slid into a deeper recession and the financial crisis continued.

In April 2009, the Federal Reserve authorized CIT to transfer  \$5.7 billion of government-guaranteed student loans to its Utah bank subsidiary; in return, the bank paid\$ 1.6 billion in cash to its parent company. At the bank level, this transaction provided collateral with which it could access the Federal Reserve discount window. However, after reporting losses for two years straight, CIT shares had lost  $98\%$  of their value[17] as delinquencies on its loan portfolio rose to  $4.7\%$  for the quarter ending June 30, 2009, compared to  $2.8\%$  for other U.S. lenders. (See Exhibit 6 for CIT stock performance.) For the same period, CIT delinquencies on consumer loans (excluding credit cards) were  $9.6\%$ , compared to a national average of  $4.5\%$ .[18] By summer 2009, each of the major rating agencies had downgraded CIT's credit ratings (see Exhibit 7) and its capitalization ratio fell to  $12.8\%$  of its risk-weighted assets.

# Oaktree's Investment in CIT

Oaktree Capital was formed in 1995 and in a short time, became a leading global alternative investment firm. As part of its investment philosophy Oaktree pursued opportunities exclusively in what it called "less efficient markets,"<sup>c</sup> focusing on distressed debt and control investments.

The financial turmoil of 2008 brought many such investment opportunities. In particular, in late 2008, Rajath Shourie and his team at Oaktree developed the view that the market was undervaluing the recovery that CIT's unsecured creditors would realize if the firm filed for bankruptcy. This assessment was built on Oaktree's experience as one of the investors in FINOVA Capital Corporation, a finance company that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001. While acquiring a position in CIT's publicly-traded debt would not allow Shourie to perform a formal due diligence process, a deep understanding of the kind of assets held by CIT and the process of bankruptcy gave Shourie confidence in his investment thesis. To realize this investment opportunity, it was in Oaktree's interest to try to accumulate a position in CIT's unsecured debt, without leaking this information to the market.[d]

All CIT notes were trading at a discount, but there was a significant dispersion in price across the different maturities of CIT unsecured notes. (See Exhibit 8.) The near-term notes were more expensive than longer-term notes, because they were more likely to be repaid at par or bought out in a restructuring. However, in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, all claims of the same seniority, regardless of their maturity, would receive a similar recovery. Moreover, if CIT would abruptly file for bankruptcy, only notes with longer maturities that were purchased at a significant discount were likely to have a positive return. The ability of CIT to continue paying off its maturing debt depended crucially on whether CIT would be accepted into TLGP, but Shourie was highly uncertain about whether this would happen. Therefore, he primarily focused on a scenario that would entail asset liquidation. With this in mind, in late 2008, Oaktree started to buy CIT unsecured notes with midterm maturities.

Debt investors typically had no influence over managerial decisions as long as the debt continued performing. This generated significant uncertainty around potential outcomes for distressed debt investors. Indeed, in Shourie's experience, it was not uncommon to expect to gain control in a restructuring and instead to be paid at par; or to take a company that seemed headed toward liquidation, and then to see it somehow survive. But for investors like Oaktree, this uncertainty was not a bad thing. Shourie recalled that some of the most successful transactions he had seen tended to be opportunistic follow-on investments like the one they were evaluating for CIT. To take advantage of these new opportunities, "one had to stay active and informed and had to have the necessary liquidity to act."

# Denial of Access to TLGP and Its Aftermath

On July 15, 2009 CIT announced that, "(d)discussions with government agencies have ceased. There is no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term."19 This led to further credit downgrades of CIT, and its annual CDS spread jumped to 6,429 basis points from 1,780 the week before (see Exhibit 9).

At the time, CIT had significant maturities of unsecured shortand long-term debt: a total of  \$59 billion as of July 15, 2009.[20] Of more immediate concern, CIT had\$ 1 billion in notes maturing on August 17, 2009, and it was unclear if the company could repay this amount. The rating agency downgrades, negative media reports, and the exclusion of the company from TLGP led many CIT clients to draw down the credit lines they had with CIT, which further drained CIT's liquidity. During the week of July 13, the drawdowns were \$0.7 billion, or twice the normal levels. At the same time, CIT could no longer act as credible guarantor in the factoring business and its best clients started to switch to other lenders. To avoid filing for bankruptcy, CIT needed to refinance its debt and extend debt maturities, or to potentially sell assets to generate sufficient cash to meet its financing needs. To meet immediate liquidity needs, CIT reached out to its largest creditors in hopes of obtaining a \$3 billion loan. If it was unable to quickly secure this financing, the company would likely be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In addition to Oaktree, the group of large investors included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), Capital Research & Management Company, Centerbridge Partners, Baupost Group, and Silver Point Capital. Although all unsecured debt classes would have the same priority in bankruptcy, their maturities were spread out over several years. Investors had their positions concentrated at different points of the maturity spectrum, which also meant that they had acquired their positions at different prices. Some of the creditors had large positions in notes maturing in August of 2009. Oaktree held a large position in the unsecured notes maturing between 2010 and 2012.

In principle, outside of a bankruptcy, restructuring could be done through voluntary exchanges. There was also a possibility of a middle ground, whereby the company would get pre-approval of a bankruptcy reorganization plan before filing for Chapter 11. This was known as a pre-packaged bankruptcy or "prepack." A pre-approved reorganization plan would substantially reduce the uncertainty, time, and expenses typically associated with a bankruptcy. In a typical bankruptcy, all claims would be sorted into separate "classes". For example, secured debtholders would be in a separate class from unsecured debtholders. For the "prepack" plan to be approved by the bankruptcy court, it would need to be approved by claimholders of at least two-thirds of the face value of the outstanding claims, representing at least one-half of the claimholders in each partially-impaired class. This voting would need to happen before the bankruptcy filing.

While a successful restructuring was not implausible, the reality was that, to date, there had not been a single successful reorganization of a major financial firm. Shourie's team had to decide whether the \(3 billion credit facility was a good investment, and if so, on what terms? With CIT barely surviving, the decision had to be made quickly.
