## Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper

### Overview

What is Commercial Paper? What is its significance?  
How are CP prices quoted?  
Where do CP prices come from?  
What are backup lines of credit, and why do all CP issuers have them?  

- What is meant by the "early-exit mechanism" of the CP market? What has been the default experience of CP investors?  
How do regulations affect the demand for different maturities?  
What happened in 2007-9 Crisis?  
Alternative - Extendible Commercial Notes

CP is the simplest security that corporations issue. It is a short-term promissory note. As long as issuers obey certain guidelines, their CP is exempt from the hassles and expense of registration requirements. The most important of these guidelines are

Maturity is less than 270 days  

- Issued in denominations too big for individual investors

Almost all CP meets these guidelines. In fact, most CP satisfies the guidelines by a wide margin.

Average maturity of outstanding CP is around 40 days  

- Average trade size is around \$20MM

In summary, CP comes from three main categories of issuers

Financial CP - issued by financial corporations such as bank holding companies, GE Capital, etc.  
Non-Financial CP - from any other kind of corporate issuer  

- Asset-Backed CP – issued by a special-purpose entity that holds financial assets such as mortgage-backed securities, car loans, etc.

Here are the quantities of these different kinds of CP over 2001-12:

This graph makes several points

- The CP market is big – altogether it's about \$1 Trillion, though it is half of what it was (peak was\$2.18 Trillion on 8/8/07)  
Non-financial issuers are not a big part of the market, only about  $18\%$  
- All categories are about  $2 / 3$  of where they were at the peak.  
- Asset-backed paper fell off a cliff

Down about  $70 \%$ from the 8/07 peak, and  $\$ 350 \mathrm{BB}$ of this fall occurred in just 4 months starting in early August 2007, with  $\$ 200 \mathrm{BB}$ of that in just 3 weeks

It's worth focusing for a moment on the ABCP crash. Here's the weekly issuance volume 2000-11:

ABCP Weekly Issuance Volume

You can see that in the early part of the decade, there was  \$200 Billion or so of new ABCP sold each week, which ramped up to\$ 500 Billion at the peak. By 12/11 it was down to around \$100 Billion each week. If we look just at 2007, we don't see the issuance volume crash quite as hard as in the previous graph, but that's because these numbers combine long-dated and short-dated paper. If we look at the distribution of maturities, we see that in August 2007, issuance abruptly shifted away from longer maturities:

Maturity Distribution of New ABCP

You can see issuance tilting heavily toward shorter paper in the latter half of 2007. You can also see that, in recent months, issuance of 41+day paper has shrunk significantly, in favor of shorter paper.

Consider also the discount rates this paper paid over this period:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/4e079705-40be-4284-ae84-98faa5edf905/dc082d8ba0e548f83b2675679b53b897131313c52743ac5f60100a10212480a0.jpg)

This shows the rates for the three categories, plus a fourth category "A2 nonfinancial" which is the lower-rated paper from non-financial issuers. The discount rates generally follow the prevailing money-market rate (known as LIBOR, for London InterBank Offered Rate):

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/4e079705-40be-4284-ae84-98faa5edf905/326516fb2230470483223004cb6bd1fcabf9d72ece9af9a391113a04c141c372.jpg)

What happened to these issuers was essentially a bank run. Firms that go to the CP market know they are exposed to bank-run risk. This is because when they issue CP, they expect to repay it by issuing CP again, i.e. by rolling it over. If they can't roll it over, they've got a problem. For this reason, a CP issuer generally has a committed bank facility at least as big as the amount of CP he has outstanding. This "backup line" plays exactly the role of the lender of last resort in the bank-run model: if the issuer needs extra cash to let investors out, it doesn't have to sell assets for bad prices, it just needs to borrow the necessary cash from the bank. Knowing this, a CP investor calculates that there's no benefit from joining a run, i.e. not rolling over his paper, so he rolls over his paper and there's no run.

- The backup line is intended to be insurance against the market melting down, not the CP issuer melting down, and it often contains covenants that limit or revoke the issuer's right to take down the line if its condition has deteriorated sufficiently  
- This limitation is known as a Material Adverse Change clause. You can read further in the discussions by Dominion Bond Rating Service and A M Best

It's important to distinguish this backup line of credit from a Letter of credit, which is explicitly a credit enhancement. A letter of credit says that if the issuer doesn't repay the paper, the bank will. So the credit quality of the paper is at least as high as the credit quality of the bank.

- So a backup line of credit is more accurately viewed as a liquidity facility, i.e. insurance against the market drying up, than a credit enhancement, i.e. insurance against the issuer going bad

Backup lines became widespread in the CP business after the Penn Central Railroad default in 1970. Penn Central was a big issuer of CP, and this was the first default in many years, and the CP market crashed. The Fed eased this crash by providing liquidity to banks so issuers could borrow to pay their

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/4e079705-40be-4284-ae84-98faa5edf905/63055c573981b60cb75aa48eb603d63a1fa8655e52f2dc1439cb1feaa657768c.jpg)  
CP

In 1970 some CP issuers had backup lines, and others did not. It was widely suspected during the Penn Central crisis that banks had an easier time borrowing at the discount window when they could show the Fed that they were borrowing more because issuers were taking down their lines.

- In other words, if you didn't have a backup line, and wanted a bank loan to pay off your maturing paper, the bank might say "we're low on cash right now because of other issuers taking down their lines, and if we try to borrow the money for you from the Fed, they won't lend because you're not taking down a backup line"

Ever since the Penn Central crisis, it has been essentially impossible for issuers to sell CP without arranging a backup line of credit. Investors worry that a company without backup credit will have a financial crisis, which could precipitate default, if the CP market panics.

- The thing to remember of backup lines of credit is that they are not credit enhancements. If a company goes bankrupt, the bank is not going to pay off its CP. They are insurance not against the company going bad, but against the CP market going bad. If the CP market panics, a backup line allows an issuer to substitute bank borrowing for his CP borrowing, and the CP investor gets out whole.  
- A backup line of credit is a CP issuer's indirect access to the lender of last resort  
- Mercury Finance had backup lines, but the banks cut off the lines when Mercury got into trouble (from fraudulent accounting).

So in today's market, issuers have backup lines. Now consider the typical issuer. As we saw, the typical issuer has the top credit rating, so if it is downgraded, it is generally still investment grade

- The issuer's banks are not unconditionally obligated to let the issuer use its backup lines, but since the issuer is still investment grade, they generally will let the issuer borrow

There was a trend that grew over the last couple years of the ABCP boom, which was a trend away from backup liquidity. That is, a number of ABCP issuers decided to save the money they would have spent on a backup line, and instead rely on what they called internal liquidity.

- So instead of a backup line, these issuers would be overcollateralized, which is to say that the assets they held (typically mortgage-backed securities) were worth sufficiently more than their liabilities  
- Typically, the issuer would value its portfolio each week, and if the value exceeded the liabilities by more than a stated percentage, then everything was considered to be fine  
- This was considered to be "internal liquidity" because the issuer could, in theory at least, pay down its liabilities by selling its assets  
The proximate cause of the collapse of ABCP issuance in August, 2007, was the failure by several ABCP issuers to meet this valuation test

A related strategy to this "internal liquidity" is what was sometimes called "extendible commercial notes", or just "extendible notes." This was a way to issue something almost like CP without paying for backup liquidity. It worked like this:

Today, I sell an extendible note  

- In 30 days, I can pay down the note. However, I have the option to instead extend the note up to a year. That is, instead of paying my creditors the principal amount, I tell them "your security now matures in a year. Over that year, I'll pay you interest keyed to the prevailing interest rate paid by paper with the same rating." These ended up getting extended during the crisis and that ended their use in new CP issues.

Here's a typical schedule of interest rates for such paper:  

<table><tr><td>Rating</td><td>% of LIBOR</td><td>Minimum Spread over LIBOR</td></tr><tr><td>A1+/P1</td><td>110</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>A1/P1</td><td>115</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>A2/P2</td><td>130</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>A3/P3</td><td>150</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;A3/P3</td><td>175</td><td>400</td></tr></table>

The message the issuer sends is "A backup line of credit would give some assurance that the paper won't default if the market goes bad. Same here – if the market goes bad, the paper won't default. But instead of paying off right away, it will convert to longer-term paper with a high interest rate."

Who buys CP, if not individuals? The biggest customers are money market mutual funds, managing the cash of individuals. The Federal Reserve attempted to identify the owners of the \(1.79 trillion of CP outstanding on 12/31/07, and found

- \$711B held by money funds (But only \$61B by 12/31/2021).
- \$85B held by pension funds  
- \$42B held by life insurance companies  
- \$125B held by mutual funds other than money

funds  

- \$83B by brokers and dealers

and so on.

In other words, the investors in CP are big institutional investors with some short-term money. Selling CP is very much like selling corporate bonds – a short list of potential investors who buy in big lots.

- The difference is that CP matures very quickly, so sellers are going back to the short list of investors many times a year.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/4e079705-40be-4284-ae84-98faa5edf905/580e554b9e5358fee8a8898eadd4e42d6c2176ae55ffd87e26833053444290b1.jpg)

CP pays no coupons, it just pays face value at maturity. If you buy \$10M face value of CP from GE Capital (the biggest issuer, by the way) maturing on April 18 (i.e., 30-day paper), then you will get \$10M on 4/18. It is therefore issued and traded at a discount, and when traders quote prices to each other, they talk in terms of discount rates, just like Tbills. So again if we call the face value F, then number of days to maturity n, and the discount rate d, then the price P is

$$
P = F - (d / 100) (n / 360) F
$$

So for example, if the discount rate for the \(10M of GECC paper is \(2.63\%\), then the price is

$$
\$ 10M - (2.63 / 100) (30 / 360) \$ 10M = \$ 9,978,083
$$

Compared to Treasury bills of the same maturity, CP has the exact same promised cash flows, but also has three disadvantages, each of which imposes a discount when investors purchase

- CP issues can default, and sometimes they do.
- Biggest ever was \$457MM of Pacific Gas & Electric paper in 2001  
- Treasury bills are widely regarded as free of default risk
- CP is less liquid. The secondary market for CP is not as active as the secondary market for Treasury bills.
- On any given day, an investor can buy CP maturing on any near-term date he wants  
He can customize his CP investment to his liquidity needs, so there is little chance he will bring it back to the market

- CP interest is subject to the income taxes of many states and municipalities, but TB interest is not

As a result of the credit risk, liquidity, and taxation drawbacks, CP trades at a discount relative to Tbills with the same maturity

## Regulations that affect demand for CP

Prime Money market mutual funds do everything they can to maintain their share prices at exactly \$1.

- Quoting a lower share price is known as breaking the buck. No retail money fund had ever broken the buck before 2008.

The SEC helped them in this regard by allowing an account standard known as straight-line amortization for instruments with 60 days or fewer to maturity. It works like this: suppose you buy  $n$ -day CP with face value  $F$  at a discount  $D$ . In other words, you paid  $F - D$  for it today, and in  $n$  days you'll get  $F$ .

As long as  $n$  is no more than 60, you can

- Value the investment at  $F - D$  
- Book  $D / n$  of interest every day for those  $n$  days

Investors will get interest at the rate  $D$  over those  $n$  days, even if the market rate has changed. If you bought all your paper at  $5\%$  and rates go to  $4\%$ , your investors keep getting  $5\%$  until that paper matures.

The virtue of doing your valuations this way is that you know that your valuation of the CP will not decrease, which could threaten your \$1 share price

- This accounting rule makes money funds especially interested in buying CP with 60 or fewer days to maturity  
- Or in other words, if you as a CP issuer keep your maturities in this range, you'll get better prices from the biggest part of your customer base

Another influence on CP maturities is the Fed's rule that banks can use CP as collateral for borrowing at the discount rule as long as its maturity is not greater than 90 days

- Banks therefore have little interest in buying longer-maturity CP

SEC regulations also affect the relative demand for highand low-rated paper. The SEC divides all CP into three categories

Tier-1: At least two ratings of A-1 or the equivalent from NRSROs  
Tier-2: At least two ratings of A-2, but not two of A-1  

- Everything else

A money fund can invest only in Tier-1 and Tier-2, and can invest only  $1\%$  of its money in any one Tier-2 issuer, and only  $5\%$  of its money in all Tier-2 issuers put together

- So the investment of money funds in Tier-2 paper is limited to  $5\%$  of their total assets. This holds down demand for Tier-2 paper  
- This is part of why demand goes down abruptly when paper is downgraded
