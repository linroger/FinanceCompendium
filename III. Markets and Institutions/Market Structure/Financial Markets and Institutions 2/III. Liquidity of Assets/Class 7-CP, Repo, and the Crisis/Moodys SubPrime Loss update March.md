## SUMMARY

Moody's has updated its projection of cumulative losses for recent vintage subprime pools. Moody's now expects cumulative losses of  $13\%$ ,  $30\%$  and  $36\%$  of original securitized subprime collateral for 2005, 2006 and 2007 vintages, respectively. These projections reflect our opinion of the loss mitigation that will be afforded by the recently announced Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP). In the absence of the plan, Moody's loss estimates would have been  $14\%$ ,  $33\%$  and  $40\%$ , respectively, for these vintages.

In September 2008<sup>1</sup>, Moody's issued a report updating its loss projections for recent vintage subprime RMBS pools. In that report, we discussed two alternative scenarios to highlight the range of potential outcomes under divergent stress assumptions. In this update to our subprime loss expectations, we have migrated to a scenario broadly consistent with the stressed scenario discussed in September.

Since September 2008, performance of subprime pools has weakened. Prepayment rates, which had been at historic lows, have further diminished to the mid single-digit range. In light of the weak housing market and limited available credit for subprime borrowers, we believe that voluntary prepayments will remain depressed. Since September 2008, loss severities on subprime loans have increased rapidly from approximately  $50\%$  to greater than  $60\%$ . We anticipate that loss severities will rise to around  $70\%$ , based on an expected further  $10 - 15\%$  decline in home values.

The rating actions resulting from these revised loss projections will vary by vintage, but it is likely that the vast majority of mezzanine and subordinate certificates currently rated B or above will be downgraded to ratings of Caa or below, particularly for such bonds issued in 2006 and 2007. Actions on senior bonds will differ based on payment priority and protection relative to projected losses.

This report will begin by discussing the trends in subprime mortgage performance that have led to Moody's revised loss projections. It will follow with a discussion of Moody's updated loss projection methodology, with a sample mortgage pool examined in detail.

## RECENT PERFORMANCE

The performance of mortgage pools backing subprime transactions issued in 2005, 2006 and 2007 has

continued to deteriorate. As of January 2009, the seasoning-adjusted rate of serious delinquencies (those loans 60 or more days delinquent, in foreclosure, or held for sale [i.e. real estate owned or REO]) has worsened in each quarter of issuance between Q1 2006 and Q2 2007, and are far higher than what earlier vintages had experienced at similar points in their lives (Figure 1).

While the proportion of delinquent loans has leveled off recently, the stabilization coincides with an acceleration of property liquidations. The rapid growth in cumulative loss levels across all quarter-vintages (Figure 2) is evidence of increasing liquidation volume. Combined, the data suggest that the volume of defaulting loans has continued to accumulate.

Currently,  $42 \%$ of outstanding 2006vintage subprime loans are at least 60 days delinquent, in foreclosure, or held for sale (REO). Moody's believes that, without intervention, nearly all of the already delinquent loans would eventually default. This assessment is based on very high observed roll rates to foreclosure combined with increasing unemployment and decreasing property values. In addition, we believe that, by year end, one-third of borrowers who are currently paying their mortgages will become delinquent and eventually default. This projection is based on loan-level analysis of the mortgages² and loan characteristics as predictors of future defaults. This analysis includes forecasted loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) for the end of 2009, when the decline in home prices is expected to reach bottom. The LTV ratios were determined by using projections from Moody's Economy.com for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). In addition, other predictive metrics such as loan type, occupancy status and documentation level were considered in the analysis.

Loss severities have also worsened in the last few months, rising to  $63\%$  according to the latest subprime performance data. We forecast a continued rise in severity to around  $70\%$ , based on an expected further  $10 - 15\%$  decline in home values. While home prices are expected to slowly recover, subprime severities are likely to remain elevated over time. Even as the housing market boomed in recent years, subprime loss severities increased with loan age. This is generally attributable to accrual of servicer advances and deterioration in property condition over the course of lengthened foreclosure timelines. The likelihood of similar issues persisting in the future leads Moody's to conclude that, despite the anticipated recovery in the housing market, subprime severities are likely to remain elevated over time.

Rapidly falling prepayments (Figure 3) are evidence of a dearth of refinancing opportunities for borrowers.

The scarcity results from a tight credit market and little or no homeowner equity. Originally high LTV ratios have further increased with declining home prices. Despite the possibility of a modest recovery in the housing environment over the next few years, Moody's expects subprime borrowers to be subject to prolonged refinancing limitations due to negative equity and lack of available credit. As the expected life of a subprime loan is extended, the likelihood of default is expected to

similarly grow as life event risk increases with the passage of time. Moody's analysis indicates that, without intervention,  $72\%$  of all remaining 2006vintage subprime loans (both current and delinquent) would eventually default. A large component of this  $72\%$  is comprised of loans that are already seriously delinquent.

When we last updated subprime loss figures in September, 2008, we generalized that our expected case corresponded to:

"an environment where performance improves over the medium-to-long term. In this scenario, levels of delinquency and default will decline, implying that government intervention, loss mitigation strategies, and recovery in the housing market will generally help the performance of non-delinquent borrowers. This scenario also assumes moderate improvement in refinancing opportunities for subprime borrowers who are current on their mortgages."

Our stressed scenario, by comparison, reflected an environment where:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/bd6ebcfb-31d7-47d9-9fbd-5a4cf4d5779a/9d17502ba8ccf0eab609e604659ae573da9b6bc78ddc3d07f11d8270dd1d5011.jpg)

"levels of delinquency and default remain elevated throughout the life of a transaction as loss severities rise. Such performance implies that government intervention and loss mitigation strategies will result in insignificant improvements in credit performance. Any near-term recovery in the housing market would be unlikely in this scenario. This scenario further assumes continued refinancing constraints for subprime borrowers, limiting future prospects for prepayment."

Since September, performance data (particularly prepayment and severity trends) suggests that the latter, more stressful scenario is materializing. As a result we are migrating our underlying assumptions to reflect such a scenario. Further, the rapid rise in loss severity relative to our current home price forecasts necessitates updating our assumptions to reflect an even more stressful case than had been previously discussed.

However, as noted above, intervention attributable to the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, announced February 18th, may have a mitigating impact on future delinquency and defaults. To account for the impact of large-scale modification, we have included an explicit calculation of modification benefit into our loss projection methodology.

## LOSS PROJECTION METHODOLOGY

While subprime pools are generally homogeneous in terms of their collateral characteristics, collateral attributes such as loan type (FRM vs ARM), geographic location and LTV can be highly predictive of performance. Therefore, we have further enhanced our previously published, loss-curve based methodology. While the updated approach will account for pool characteristics on a deal-by-deal basis, the underlying assumptions for the subprime population as a whole are generally consistent with those underlying our stressed loss curve expectations. Ultimately we migrated away from the loss-curve-based approach outlined in the September paper because we believe that the updated approach will more precisely distinguish between the relative risks across pools.

## The Default Burnout Factor (DBF) Approach with Collateral Analysis

The Default Burnout Factor (DBF) approach is based on the assumption that the portion of a pool that is current when home prices bottom out in the future will perform better than the portion of the pool that has already defaulted or is seriously delinquent at that point in time.

Therefore, we seek to, first, project serious delinquencies forward to the anticipated home-price trough. Second, we calculate the implied, transaction-specific lifetime default rate reflective of that delinquency projection. Third, Moody's adjusts this default rate to reflect improving future prepayment and default conditions and applies the resulting rate to the projected remaining loans. To all projected defaults we apply our deal-specific severity expectation. Overall this expectation for 2005 through 2007 vintage deals averages roughly  $70\%$ .

## Projecting Delinquencies

Specifically, the DBF approach uses current performance trends to project out delinquencies and prepayments through late 2009 (the projection date), corresponding to the current expected trough in home prices. Based on home price projections from Moody's Economy.com, as well as on other research, we have assumed that home prices will fall by  $10 - 15\%$  during 2009 and will bottom out by year end.

Our methodology projects serious delinquencies for each pool forward to year end by averaging the results of two distinct approaches:

- Performance-Based Projection - The projected serious delinquency rate is determined by linearly interpolating the observed trends in the serious delinquency rate and the loan default rate for the pool over the most recent 6 months.  
- Collateral-Based Projection - The serious delinquency rate for each pool is projected using a regression model based on key loan-level credit characteristics and metro-level home price behavior. For each loan in the pool, the likelihood of serious delinquency or default as of the projection date is estimated using a regression model based on loan type (fixed/adjustable), purpose, documentation, occupancy status, property type, FICO score, origination loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and expected home price appreciation/depreciation from the loan closing date until the end of 2009. The individual loan results are aggregated to determine the serious delinquency and default projection for the pools they belong to. (The Appendix provides a detailed description of the collateral-based projection methodology.)

The results of the performance-based and collateral-based projection methods are generally within  $20\%$  of each other. For some individual pools, however, the difference in the results may be more significant. When considering these two approaches Moody's typically assigns a weight of  $30\%$  to the performance-based projection and  $70\%$  to the collateral-based projection.<sup>3</sup>

Once delinquencies have been projected, Moody's subprime expected lifetime roll rates are applied to arrive at lifetime defaults. These roll rates are converted to a default rate by taking a weighted average based on the current, pool-specific distribution of serious delinquencies. An example of this calculation as well as expected subprime lifetime roll rates are presented in Figure 5.

## Calculating Lifetime Default Rate ("Default-to-Liquidation")

Moody's calculates an adjusted Default-to-Liquidation rate based on the current level of cumulative defaults to date, the defaults resulting from the roll rate analysis, and the assumed prepayments.

- Cumulative defaults to date are observed from historic performance data by dividing cumulative losses to date by historic average severities.  
- Defaults from the projected pipeline are taken from the calculation described above  
- Prepayments are assumed to be held constant at their current levels based on individual pool performance through the year-end projection period (subject to a cap of  $10\%$ )

Default-to-liquidation is calculated by, first, adding cumulative defaults to date to expected defaults from the projected delinquency pipeline. Next, the resulting sum is divided by the pool pay-down to date adjusted for the expected prepayment to year end. The resulting ratio will next be adjusted to reflect expected relative improvement in performance as described below.

## Applying the Default Burn-out Factor

Finally, the portion of the pool that is not seriously delinquent on the projection date is assumed to perform better than the portion of the pool that had been seriously delinquent up to that point. This is reflected in the Default Burnout Factor (DBF) assumption. Put simply, the DBF represents one minus the expected reduction in default rates going forward.

The expected default rate on the non-seriously delinquent portion of the pool after projection date is the product of the previously calculated Default-to-Liquidation rate and the DBF. Projected losses on this portion of the pool are calculated by multiplying the projected default rate by the assumed loss severity rate.

Typical DBFs applied to 2006 & 2007 vintage subprime pools average  $75\%$ . However, DBFs can range from  $50\%$  to  $90\%$  depending on each pool's historical performance and collateral composition. For example a lower DBF may be applied to a fixed-rate pool deemed to be more responsive to improving conditions as a function of its collateral characteristics and/or performance history. Conversely, a pool which may have seen high prepayments early in its life, but has substantially weaker collateral remaining may have a higher DBF applied to it. Along these lines, pools from the 2005 vintage had generally experienced stronger performance early in their lives which is generally not expected to be replicated going forward. To these, Moody's will typically apply a DBF of  $85\%$ .

After calculating a pool's remaining defaults based on the application of the DBF, Moody's arrives at total future defaults by adding the resulting projection to defaults expected from the projected pipeline. The pool-specific loss severity assumption is then applied to the resulting sum to arrive at projected future losses.

The result can then be added to cumulative losses incurred to date to arrive at expected lifetime cumulative losses.

## Projecting Loss Given Default ("Loss Severity") & Calculating Losses

Loss severity is estimated by taking an equally weighted  ${}^{4}$  average of the following three values:

- The most recent actual three-month average severity observed on the pool  $(+8\%^5$  to adjust for anticipated future severity increases);  
- A collateral-driven severity estimate. This is determined through a loan level analysis of LTV, future anticipated home price change, estimated gross recovery, time to liquidate the property, and various liquidation and maintenance costs (see Appendix for more details); and  
- General Subprime  $1^{st}$  Lien Severity Assumption: 70%

In addition, the observed average loss severity component is subject to a floor (55%) and a cap (75%) to eliminate data anomalies and any volatility associated with limited sample sizes. This cap and floor will also be adjusted to account for lender paid mortgage insurance coverage

## Adjusting For Second Lien Loans

Many primarily first lien transactions contain portions of collateral that are junior-lien in nature. Therefore, we must adjust the described approach to account for the risk differential between the two asset types.

Since most subprime borrowers are in a negative equity position, second lien loans have defaulted at an alarming rate. The negative equity results in  $100\%$  loss given default in virtually all cases. Given the elevated risk associated with second lien collateral Moody's assumes that the few remaining second lien loans in first lien securitizations will default at a frequency of  $90\%$  with  $100\%$  severity.

## Adjusting Loss Projections for Potential Modification

As noted above, we have tempered its "no-intervention" loss projections to account for the large-scale mortgage modifications that are now likely. Moody's pre-intervention analytics, outlined in the preceding sections, would forecast average losses to the 2005, 2006 and 2007 vintage subprime pools of  $14\%$ ,  $33\%$ , and  $40\%$  of original securitized balances, respectively. Potential government-sponsored modification programs, notably the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP), lead us to reduce our current cumulative loss forecasts to  $13\%$ ,  $30\%$ , and  $36\%$  of original balances for the respective vintages.

In our opinion, servicers would be substantially more aggressive in modifying mortgages going forward given the incentive structure and explicit guidelines of the HASP Plan. Servicers, however, will be unable to modify some of the loans that are likely to default – including many loans currently in foreclosure and all loans in REO. Additionally many investor property loans, second lien loans, and lowor no-documentation loans will be ineligible for modification. Although the outlined HASP Plan has stressed interest rate reduction as the first option, and any cram-down legislation has yet to pass, we believe that some successful modifications will involve principal reduction. We also anticipate that some small amount of principal losses would occur through the modification of loans that would have otherwise paid in full without the benefit of modification. Ultimate loss reduction in this sector will hinge on the modification program's success in avoiding re-default.

## Estimating Modification Rates

In light of the HASP plan's goals and industry-wide call to action, as well as the incentive payments and cost-sharing it offers, servicers are likely to seek to implement more aggressive modification terms wherever possible. The \$1,000 upfront cash incentive provided to servicers for each modification will alleviate additional costs associated with active loss mitigation efforts and could encourage servicers to modify more loans. In forecasting modification rates under the HASP plan, we assume that servicers will be reasonably aggressive in their modification efforts.

Given these assumptions and constraints, Moody's modification analysis begins by projecting the balance of loans that will be modified. The starting point for this projection is Moody's calculation of the percentage of expected future defaults using the methodology described above. This calculation is made by merely taking projected future losses, as a percentage of the outstanding balance divided by expected future severity.

Once we derive expected future defaults without intervention, we then determine the balance of loans which may be modified by eliminating those that are identified as ineligible, including:

100% of loans classified as REO  
100% of remaining second lien loans  
33% of loans currently in foreclosure

Moody's estimated modification rate,  $50\%$ , is then applied to the resulting figure.

As many ineligible loans, such as investor loans and unemployed obligors, are likely to remain even after the aforementioned exclusions, our assumed  $50\%$  modification rate would actually represent a more substantial proportion of eligible mortgages.

### Projecting Recidivism and Principal Forgiveness

The re-default rates on loans modified so far have been significant with over half of these borrowers becoming delinquent again in a very short time (i.e. six-months). However, it is expected that servicers may attempt more aggressive modifications - lowering borrowers' rates to as low as  $2\%$  and forbearing substantial portions of principal without interest. While ultimate recidivism could range from  $40\%$  to  $100\%$ , Moody's estimates that  $65\%$  of modified loans will re-default. Further Moody's expects principal losses to occur through some servicer actions. Given the targeted  $38\%$  &  $31\%$  DTI levels, we believe that a portion of successful modifications will be, in part, due to reduced principal obligations. Therefore, we have further adjusted our loss expectations by the approximation that  $15\%$  to  $25\%$  of successful modifications (those which do not re-default) will involve principal reductions averaging  $15\%$  of their outstanding balance.

Moody's expects that a percentage of loans not expected to default under our projection will also receive modifications, some of which would also include principal reductions. Losses attributable to such modification will partially offset the reduction to loss projections. Moody's estimates that  $2 - 5\%$  of loans which would otherwise not default will receive principal modifications of  $15\%$ .

Each of the previously outlined assumptions regarding modification represents our best estimate under highly uncertain conditions. As more data with respect to the level, type and effectiveness of modifications undertaken within the HASP guidelines become available, we will adjust our assumptions accordingly.

As an example, Moody's expects that, without intervention,  $72\%$  of outstanding 2006-vintage subprime loans will default. As approximately  $10\%$  of such loans are in REO,  $16\%$  are in foreclosure and  $2\%$  are second liens, we assume that of the projected defaults, only  $54\%$  of outstanding loans could be eligible for modification. This remaining  $54\%$  will still include some investor obligors, some recently unemployed borrowers and others who will prove too difficult to modify. Moody's assumes  $50\%$  of the  $54\%$  will be modified, or  $27\%$  of the outstanding balance. Given that an additional portion of loans that would have otherwise paid in full without modification will also be modified, Moody's arrives at its expectation that  $30 - 35\%$  of outstanding loans will be modified.

### Calculating Updated Projected Losses - An Example

Figure 6 provides an example of the DBF approach applied to a sample subprime transaction, quantifying losses without the benefit of the HASP Plan or other substantive modification program. This transaction is assumed to have a pool factor of  $55\%$  (Row A) at 30 months of seasoning (Row B), a CPR of  $8\%$  (Row C), and realized losses to date of  $6\%$  (Row G).

The DBF approach projects delinquencies to the end of 2009. Row T shows that the projected  $60+$  delinquency rate as a percent of original balance as of year end is projected to be  $31\%$ . This figure is arrived at by weighting the collateral (Row S) and Performance (Row R) projections by  $30\%$  and  $70\%$  respectively.

Rows T looks to the distribution of delinquencies compared to the lifetime roll rates (from Figure 6) in assigning expected default frequency to the projected delinquency. In this case,  $95\%$  of the projected delinquencies are expected to default.

Row X, the adjusted pool factor, shows the portion of the pool's original balance (19%) that is estimated to be outstanding and current (that is, less than 60 days delinquent) as of year end. This is calculated by, first, reducing the current pool factor (55%) by any principal pay-down through the projection point (7.5% = 90% pool factor * 10% Annual CPR / 12 * 10 months) less the percentage of the previously described projected delinquencies (31%) and any current second liens.

Applying expected lifetime average loss severity assumptions (Row V) to the projected defaults, and adding back losses to date, we arrive at cumulative losses after projected delinquencies (Row Y),  $27\%$  in the example. The total defaults to this point (Row Z) can be calculated by dividing cumulative losses as of today by historical average loss severities and adding this to the expected defaults from the projected delinquency pipeline. Next, this can be converted to a cumulative default rate by calculating implied cumulative defaults (Row Z) as a percentage of the aggregate first lien pool factor reduction (100% minus Row X minus Row D). This implies a projected and realized default rate as a percentage of original balance (as shown in Row AA) of  $49\%$ .

Utilizing the resulting figure as the expected future default rate would imply that past performance, given macro-conditions, would be replicated on the remaining pool. However, as demonstrated in the example, we expect conditions to improve in terms of both prepayments and defaults. Therefore, we reduce the anticipated future default rate by the DBF (Row AB) to reach the anticipated default rate to be applied to the adjusted pool factor from row X. Multiplying the adjusted pool factor (row X), by the expected future severity (Row V) and also by the projected default rate (row AC), we arrive at projected future losses (Row AD)  $(19\% * 37\% * 70\% = 5\%)$ .

Finally, the cumulative loss projection (as a percent of original balance) is equal to  $32\%$  (Row AE). This equals the sum of current realized losses (Row G,  $6\%$ ), projected pipeline losses (Row W,  $21\%$ ), projected future first lien losses (Row AD,  $5\%$ ) and expected future second lien losses (Row E *  $90\%$ ,  $0.9\%$ ).

# Modification Adjustment

Continuing with the previous example, figure 7 below presents how Moody's will adjust the previously described analysis to account for the estimated benefit derived from of large-scale modification.

First, we calculate projected future defaults by dividing projected loss (as a percentage of outstanding balance) by expected future loss severity. Next, to limit the loans eligible for modification, we subtract all loans classified as REO as well as any remaining second lien loans and 1/3 of all foreclosures. In this example we are left with  $55\%$  of remaining loans eligible for modification.

To this figure, we then apply the estimated modification rate from row I (50%) to arrive at projected modifications of 26% of the outstanding pool. Assuming servicers successfully mitigate default for 35% of these borrowers (65% re-default rate: row K) we arrive at projected defaults despite modification (17%: row L). This figure is then added to the projected non-modified defaults (row M) to arrive at the adjusted total default projection of 60% of outstanding loan balance (row N).

Next we calculate losses attributable to principal reductions. The first component of this calculation generates the anticipated losses from reduced principal on cured loans. To calculate this value we first, identify the cured loans (100% minus row K times row J) and apply our expected frequency and severity of principal reduction occurring within cured loans (Frequency = 20%: row O, Severity = 15%: row P). The result, in this example, is less than 1% of current balance lost due to principal reduction. The second component of losses is attributable to principal reduction on loans that did not need modification to avoid default. To calculate this value we multiply the percentage of loans we do not expect to default (31%) by the percentage of such loans anticipated to be modified and the percentage of such modifications expected to reduce principal. The product of the prior calculation is multiplied by the expected severity of loss associated with principal reduction (row P) to arrive at projected losses (row T). Total losses

attributable to principal reductions are then added (row U) to the adjusted loss from re-defaulting modifications (row N divided by row C) to arrive at the modification adjusted projected loss (row V).

## LOSS PROJECTION RESULTS

The resulting total projected losses for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 vintages are summarized in Figure 8. We continue to observe a material difference in expected cumulative loss by vintage, and anticipate substantially larger losses for late 2006 and early 2007 than for deals securitized earlier.

In Moody's updated projections, the 2005 vintage will ultimately lose an average of  $13\%$  of original securitized balance, corresponding to an additional loss of  $36\%$  of the outstanding balance. 2006 vintage subprime pools will ultimately lose an average of  $30\%$  of the original securitized balance, corresponding to an additional loss of  $45\%$  of the outstanding balance. Subprime pools issued in 2007 pools will on average lose  $36\%$  of original balance, an additional  $42\%$  of the outstanding collateral balance.

A number of factors will influence the extent to which ultimate losses differ from Moody's updated projections. Loss severities will depend in part on whether home price depreciation proceeds ahead of or behind Moody's expectation as well as the speed of the foreclosure and liquidation process. Future default frequencies will likely be influenced by broad economic factors such as unemployment. Further economic decline would hasten the pace of new defaults, while a strong rebound might dampen it. And, among the largest uncertainties, the willingness of the government to directly intervene in the housing and/or securitization markets could have substantial impact on the ultimate outcome.

There will continue to be much uncertainty about the ultimate scope and effectiveness of the recently announced Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan for at least several months, and potentially well over a year. Given this uncertainty and the rating implications of successful, large-scale loss mitigation efforts, Moody's has tempered its loss expectations accordingly. If the program ultimately proves underutilized or recidivism rates exceed our estimates, we may revise our loss projections accordingly.

## Impact of Updated Loss Projections on Ratings

Moody's expects significant rating migration across the capital structure for virtually all 2005, 2006 and 2007 transactions. However, the sequential nature of most principal waterfalls will ensure that the ratings of many senior bonds that are deemed highly likely to be paid in full in the near term will be confirmed.

While the modification assumptions described above have had a mitigating effect on projected losses, it is noteworthy that extensive modifications could reduce available credit support. Aggressive reductions in mortgage rates on subprime borrowers will reduce available excess spread that would have otherwise been utilized to cover pool losses and accelerate the retirement of senior securities. The level of modifications currently anticipated will likely reduce excess spread by  $20 - 40\%$  over the next few years, based on our updated projections. In assigning updated ratings to subprime RMBS, this assumed loss of excess spread will offset a material portion of the anticipated reduction in default achieved through loan modification.

Overall, the forthcoming rating changes will vary by vintage and collateral quality, but it is likely that the vast majority of mezzanine and subordinate certificates currently rated B or above would be downgraded to ratings of Caa or below, particularly for bonds issued in 2006 and 2007. Actions on senior bonds will differ based on payment priority and protection relative to projected losses. Given the level of losses currently projected, a majority of senior certificates will likely be downgraded below investment grade. Many, particularly longer duration senior bonds from 2006 and 2007, are expected to be downgraded to B or below.

As general guidance to subprime RMBS ratings at the lower end of Moody's scale, securities rated B2 or higher are likely to be paid off in full under expected conditions. Once a security is likely to take a loss under an expected scenario, we will typically rate it B3 or lower. To determine those ratings, an estimated recovery ratio is calculated using available enhancement, including excess spread, and the priority of principal distribution. Securities with expected recoveries of  $75\%$  to  $95\%$  are rated in the Caa range. Securities with expected recoveries of  $25\%$  to  $75\%$  are rated Ca, while securities are rated C if their expected recoveries are below  $25\%$ .

## APPENDIX: COLLATERAL-BASED DELINQUENCY PROJECTION

In addition to its linear projections based on a pool's past performance, Moody's supplemented its delinquency projections with a loan-level collateral-based approach. The performance-based and collateral-based projections are weighted in a pool's ultimate delinquency projection as of the projection date. The collateral-based approach incorporates loan characteristics such as borrower FICO, CLTV, loan type and purpose, and level of documentation as well as an estimate on home price appreciation (HPA) in order to project the likelihood that a loan will default over the projection period.

# Data Sample and Variables

Moody's compiled loan-level collateral and performance data for loans included in subprime transactions issued in 2005, 2006 and 2007. We apportioned the overall loan population into six subgroups by period of half-yearly origination (1H2005-2H2007).

Moody's classified each first lien loan according to seven independent variables. Two of the variables, Origination FICO and Updated Combined Loan to Value (CLTV), take numerical values. The rest featured values that were classified as follows:

- Loan Type: Fixed or ARM  
Loan Purpose: Purchase, Refinance or Cash-Out  
Occupancy: Investor, Owner, or Other  
- Documentation: Unknown, Full, Partial, or No documentation  
Property Type: Single Family, Other, Condominiums

The Updated CLTV is intended to capture the impact of changes in home prices on default performance, calculated as follows:

Updated CLTV = Origination CLTV * Origination Median Home Price/Current Median Home Price

Median home prices were obtained from Moody's Economy.com at an MSA level.

# Analytical Approach and Results

Moody's developed a logistic regression to quantify the historical relationship of a loan's characteristics with its probability of default. The dependent variable, State of Default, was set equal to 1 if the loan has defaulted and 0 if it has not defaulted between the time of origination and late 2008. For this purpose, Moody's defines a defaulted loan as one that is 60 or more days delinquent, in foreclosure or REO, in bankruptcy, or charged-off.

Moody's found that all of the variables were statistically significant for the subgroups. The impacts of key variables such as FICO and Updated CLTV were consistent across vintages. The impacts of other variables, however, were moderately different across origination periods. Moody's believes that differences in origination practices across vintages are driving these differences in the observed results.

# Projecting Roll Rates on Non-Delinquent Loans

The final step in the analysis is to transform the default likelihoods obtained from the regression output into 12-month roll-rates to default for non-delinquent loans.

For any given combination of loan characteristics, the regression equation gives the likelihood of that loan defaulting. In order to link that default probability to the rate at which current loans will roll into default over the projection period, Moody's compared the regression output of loans that were current as of late 2007 with those loans' rate of delinquency as of late 2008. Figure 9 describes the upward-sloping relationship between the loans' estimated default likelihood (grouped in cohorts rounded to the nearest integer) and their rate of  $60+$  delinquency. For example, for all of the loans that were current as of late 2007 with an estimated default likelihood of  $20\%$ ,  $17\%$  were found to be in default 12 months later. Three distinct roll-rate curves were developed for vintages 2005 to 2007.

Moody's projects the default likelihood of each non-delinquent loan by applying Moody's Economy.com MSA-level 12-month HPA forecasts to the Updated CLTV and plugging it, along with the other loan characteristics, into the regression equation. Moody's then finds the corresponding 12-month delinquency rate for the resulting default likelihood cohort and applies it to each loan in the cohort, giving the loans' probability of becoming  $60+$  days delinquent over the projection period. A pool's delinquency projection is the sum of (1) the aggregation of these probabilities for each current loan in the pool and (2) the percentage of loans that were already in default as of the current date.

The above analysis was only used for first lien loans. For second lien loans, Moody's assumes harsher default likelihood and did not utilize the above analysis.

# Calculating Loss Severity Using Forward-Looking HPA Forecast

Moody's applied Updated LTVs and general assumptions regarding the costs of maintenance and liquidation (10% of the current home price), interest (10%), taxes and insurance (7%), and gross proceeds (70% of projected property value) to defaulted loans in order to calculate loan loss severities:

Loss Severity = (Updated LTV - Net Proceeds) / Updated LTV, where

Net Proceeds = Gross Proceeds - Maintenance and Liquidation Costs - Interest Costs - Taxes and Insurance Expenses

Although the above assumptions are based on historical data on home liquidation, an increase in foreclosure sale and REO liquidation timelines along with higher discounts on liquidations may result in higher actual loss severities than expected.
