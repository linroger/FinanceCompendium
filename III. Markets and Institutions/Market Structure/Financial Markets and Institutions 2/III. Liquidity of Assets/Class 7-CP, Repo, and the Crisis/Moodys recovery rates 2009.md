# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

# Summary

This report comprises Moody's twenty-second annual default study in which we update statistics on the default, loss, and rating transition experience of corporate bond and loan issuers for 2008, as well as for the historical period since 1920. Briefly, we find that:

101 Moody's-rated corporate issuers defaulted on a total of  \$238.6 billion of bonds and\$ 42.6 billion of loans in 2008. Including issuers who were not rated as of January 1, 2008, 104 corporate issuers defaulted on \$239.8 billion of bonds and \$42.8 billion of loans.  
The financial industry was the most troubled sector in 2008 as measured by default volume. In that sector, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. in September was the largest default in history (\(120.2 billion debt).  
Across regions, 84 of the 101 defaulters in 2008 were North American issuers (74 in the U.S and 10 in Canada) with defaulted debt volumes totaling  \$226.2 billion. In Europe, 12 Moody's-rated corporate issuers defaulted on\$ 53.4 billion of debt. The remaining defaulters were Latin-American and Asian issuers.  
Moody's global speculative-grade default rate ended 2008 at  $4.1\%$ , more than quadrupling 2007's year-end level of  $0.9\%$ . The default rate for all Moody's-rated corporate issuers rose to  $1.9\%$  at the end of 2008 from  $0.3\%$  at year-end 2007.  

- Measured on a dollar volume basis, Moody's global speculative-grade bond default rate ended 2008 at  $5.8\%$ , up from 2007's year-end level of  $0.6\%$ . Among all Moody's-rated issuers, the volume-weighted default rate increased from  $0.1\%$  in 2007 to  $2.2\%$  in 2008.  
Moody's global speculative-grade default rate forecasting model predicts that the speculative-grade default rate will jump sharply to  $16.4\%$  in the fourth quarter of 2009, a level that, if it materializes, would exceed the peaks reached in 1991 and 2001.

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

Rating downgrades in 2008 surpassed rating upgrades for the first time since 2003. The upgrade-to-downgrade ratio fell significantly from 2.0 in 2007 to 0.3 in 2008.  

- Measured using post-default trading prices, the average recovery rate for senior unsecured bonds dropped from  $53.3\%$  in 2007 to  $33.8\%$  in 2008.

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

# Introduction

Moody's credit ratings facilitate the efficient functioning of capital markets by providing independent opinions on the creditworthiness of debt obligations issued by corporate issuers around the world. One of the primary purposes of Moody's corporate default study is to communicate the historical performance of Moody's ratings as predictors of default and loss severity for corporate issuers. In addition to providing useful data for investors and regulators, Moody's default studies also contribute to the transparency of the rating process and directly address the meaning of Moody's long-term debt ratings scale.

In the following three sections, we first summarize corporate default experience and credit trends in 2008 and discuss Moody's forecast for speculative-grade corporate defaults and recovery rates in 2009. This is followed by a review of rating accuracy metrics. We then present historical statistics on corporate defaults, ratings transitions, ratings performance metrics, and recovery rates. This year's default study contains several revisions to the historical data relative to previous years' reports, which are described in detail in a separate section at the end of the study. Finally, this report includes several detailed sections describing the methodologies used to generate the statistics as well as a guide to their reading and interpretation.

# 2008 – Financial Crisis Leads to Record Default Volumes

The global financial crisis reached a fevered pitch in 2008 with the failure of a number of large financial institutions, including the largest defaulter in history - the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Combined with defaults by other large financial institutions, including Washington Mutual and three large Icelandic banks, dollar default volumes easily set record highs. However, the damage was not limited to financial institutions as the financial crisis pushed the US and other developed economies into recession, and severely limited non-financial issuers' ability to access the debt markets. In fact, the high-yield debt markets were essentially closed for much of 2008 and high yield spreads reached record levels of roughly 2,000 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a result, defaults by non-financial issuers climbed sharply as the year proceeded with many distressed issuers unable to refinance maturing debt or obtain forbearance from covenant violations.

World-wide, 101 Moody's-rated corporate issuers defaulted on a total of  \$281.2 billion of debt in 2008. Default counts and volumes both surged from 2007 when only 18 companies defaulted on\$ 6.7 billion of debt. From a geographic standpoint, 84 of the 101 defaulters were based in North America while 12 were based in Europe. On a volume basis, defaulted debt totaled \$226.2 billion in North America and \$53.4 billion in Europe. Exhibit 1 presents annual default counts and defaulted debt volumes for the period 1970 to 2008. The chart shows that default volume in 2008 easily reached a record high, while the number of defaulted issuers was the highest since 2002. Exhibit 21 on page 19 lists the top ten defaults among Moody's-rated issuers for the period 1920-2008, six of which were by 2008 defaulters.

Exhibit 1

Among the 101 defaulters in 2008, more than half were by issuers in the broad Capital or Consumer Industries sectors<sup>1</sup>. Within these two sectors, defaults were highest in the Hotel, Gaming, & Leisure (15 defaulters) and Construction & Building (6 defaulters) industries. Measured by default volume, however, the FIRE<sup>2</sup> and Banking sectors easily topped the non-financial sectors as they accounted for almost  $80\%$  of the total default volume in 2008. The failures of Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, GMAC and three Icelandic banks were the largest defaulting financial institutions in terms of dollar volume. The largest non-financial defaulter was Tribune Company with almost \$13 billion in volume.

A unique characteristic of initial default events in 2008 was the high incidence of distressed exchanges. With debt markets essentially closed for high yield issuers, and the scarcity of DIP financing making bankruptcy a less attractive option, distressed issuers with unsustainable capital structures or liquidity problems had few options other than to offer debt exchanges, effectively implementing out-of-court restructurings that constitute events of default under Moody's definition of default. Of the 101 defaulters in 2008,  $23\%$ , or 23, were distressed exchanges, which is more than double the historical average of  $10\%$  of total initial default events. Exhibit 2 breaks down the 101 defaults in 2008 by initial default type and broad industry.

As a result of rapidly increasing defaults in 2008, the trailing twelve-month issuer-weighted default rate for all Moody's-rated issuers jumped from  $0.3\%$  in 2007 to  $1.9\%$  in 2008, marking its first up-tick since 2001. Among speculative-grade issuers, the default rate rose to  $4.1\%$  in 2008, more than a fourfold increase from its closing level of  $0.9\%$  at the end of 2007. To put this in historical perspective, since 1983, Moody's annual default rate for speculative-grade corporate issuers has averaged  $4.4\%$ , with the annual peak in 2001 at  $10.1\%$  and the trough in 2007 at  $0.9\%$ . Before 1983, the speculative-grade default rate reached a record peak of  $15.4\%$  during the Great Depression (see Exhibit 3). Measured on a dollar volume basis, Moody's speculative-grade corporate bond default rate jumped from  $0.6\%$  in 2007 to  $5.8\%$  in 2008. And the volume-weighted default rate for all Moody's-rated issuers increased to  $2.2\%$  in 2008 from  $0.1\%$  in 2007.

Exhibit 3

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

Consistent with rapidly weakening credit quality and increasing numbers of defaults, the upgrade-to-downgrade ratio for corporate issuers fell sharply in 2008. Specifically, there were 992 downgrades and 268 upgrades in 2008, sending the upgrade-to-downgrade ratio to 0.3 compared with 2.0 in  $2007^{3}$ . Exhibit 4 shows the annual upgrade-to-downgrade ratio for Moody's-rated corporate issuers between 1970 and 2008, indicating that the 2008 decline in the ratio was the largest in the past 39 years. Since 1970, the upgrade-to-downgrade ratio has averaged at 0.8.

Exhibit 4

Historically, as shown by Moody's research, default rates and recovery rates are negatively correlated. In 2008, this negative correlation reared its head again as rising default rates coincided with declining recovery rates. As shown in Exhibit 5, and as measured by post-30 day trading prices, average recovery rates for bonds and loans in all lien positions dropped in 2008 from 2007. For example, in 2008, senior unsecured bonds recovered an average of  $33.8\%$  on an issuer-weighted basis, well below 2007's  $53.3\%$ . Measured on a value-weighted basis, the decline was even more pronounced as the average senior unsecured bond recovery rate fell to  $26.2\%$  in 2008, from a level of  $56.9\%$  a year earlier. And relative to historical averages, recovery rates of all debts, with the exception of senior secured bonds, were below average in 2008 when measured on an issuer-weighted basis.

Value-weighted recovery rates were noticeably lower than issuer-weighted recovery rates in 2008 as larger defaulters experienced lower recovery rates relative to those of smaller defaulters. And, as shown in Exhibit 6, the recovery rates for large financial institutions in 2008 were especially low with Lehman Brothers recovering  $9\%$  on its senior unsecured bonds and the three Icelandic banks recovering less than  $5\%$  on their senior unsecured bonds. Washington Mutual Bank and Washington Mutual, however, recovered an average of  $42\%$  and the GMAC's distressed debt exchange led the pack with a relatively high recovery rate at about  $70\%$ .

Recovery rates in 2008 would have been even lower had it not been for the record level of distressed exchanges, which typically yield relatively high recovery rates. As shown in Exhibit 7 for 2008 defaulters, debt holders at all lien positions experienced higher recoveries on distressed exchanges relative to other types of defaults. For example, senior unsecured bond holders experienced an average  $50.8\%$  recovery rate from distressed exchanges, more than double the average recovery rates of  $20.8\%$  and  $24.4\%$  for payment defaults and bankruptcies, respectively.

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

The recovery data discussed above is based on debt trading prices 30 days after the default date. An alternative recovery measure is based on ultimate recoveries, or the value creditors realize at the resolution of a default event. For example, for issuers filing for bankruptcy, the ultimate recoveries are the present values of the cash and/or securities that creditors actually receive when these issuers exit bankruptcy, typically 1-2 years following their initial default dates.<sup>4</sup>

In Exhibit 8, we present data on ultimate recovery rates for North American companies in Moody's Ultimate Recovery Database.5 Last year, Moody's added 20 firms that either emerged from bankruptcy or resolved their default events in 2008. The average "firm-wide" recovery rate for these 20 firms was  $63.0\%$ , below 2007's  $68.7\%$  level, but still well above the long-term average of  $53.4\%$  since 1987. As shown in Exhibit 8, the individual debts at these 20 firms, in most cases, enjoyed higher recoveries in 2008 compared to historical averages. However, among the 10 of the 20 companies that defaulted in 2008 and also had their default events resolved in the same year, debt holders of all priorities, except senior unsecured bonds, experienced weaker recovery rates compared to their 1987-2008 historical averages. Since there is a substantial time lag between an issuer's default date and when its ultimate recovery is known, these data are consistent with there also being a lag in the observed cyclicality of ultimate recovery rates and default rates.

1. Some of these numbers differ from last year's report due to new data being added to the Ultimate Recovery Database during 2008.  
2. There were only two sr. sub bond defaults in 2008.

As highlighted above, Moody's and other academic researchers have found that annual corporate default rates are negatively correlated with annual average recovery rates as measured by post-default trading prices. There is also a similar negative relationship using ultimate data.<sup>7</sup> As shown in panel A in Exhibit 9, a linear regression of annual average senior unsecured bond recovery rates on annual speculative-grade default rates yields an R-square value of 0.5. In panel B using firm-wide ultimate recoveries, a similar negative correlation is also observed with an R-square of 0.4.

Moody's credit ratings are opinions of relative expected credit losses upon default, which are functions of both the probability of default and severity of default (LGD). Exhibit 10 shows annual credit loss rates from 1982 to 2008 for Moody's-rated corporate issuers. In 2008, the rising default rate, coupled with a higher loss severity rate, led to an increase in the credit loss rate among Moody's-rated issuers to  $1.2\%$ , compared to  $0.2\%$  in 2007. The average annual credit loss rate since 1982 is  $0.9\%$  (see underlying data in Exhibit 29).

# Default and Recovery Outlook for 2009

# Default Rate Forecasts

The ongoing banking crisis and global economic downturn make it almost certain that default rates will continue to climb sharply during 2009. The only outstanding questions are to what levels they will rise and how quickly. Because the impact of the current economic downturn on corporate debt issuers is likely to be more severe than for the two most recent credit cycles of the early 1990s and 2000s, Moody's expects that the speculative-grade default rate will exceed the peaks of  $11.9\%$  and  $10.4\%$  reached in those cycles, respectively. Indeed, the speculative-grade default rate could exceed the  $15.4\%$  record level set in 1933, when the speculative-grade market was solely a fallen angel market comprised exclusively of downgraded investment-grade issuers.

Moody's formal forecasting model, the Credit Transition Model (CTM)<sup>8</sup>, indicates that the global issuer-weighted speculative-grade default rate will hit a peak of  $16.4\%$  in November. If this forecast materializes, the speculative-grade default rate will almost quadruple from a level of  $4.1\%$  at the end of 2008. In terms of the absolute numbers of the defaulters, the model forecast implies roughly 300 defaulters in 2009.

Exhibit 11 shows the model's baseline forecasts through 2009, as well as the optimistic and pessimistic forecast scenarios. The baseline forecast assumes that the unemployment rate will increase to  $9.0\%$  in the U.S. and  $8.2\%$  in Europe by year end. We note, however, that the high level of uncertainty surrounding the likely severity and length of the current global economic downturn imply similarly high uncertainty around the point estimates of model-based forecasts of default rates. Moreover, some of the model's main drivers, including the current record low ratings mix of Moody's issuers and record high levels of high yield bond spreads, are in ranges not seen in the historical data used to parameterize the model, implying heightened model risk.

Exhibit 11

The high level of the high yield bond spread, which is a primary driver underlying the model's forecasts for rising default rates in 2009, began increasing in the second half of 2007 and reached a peak of approximately 2,000 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2008. Coincident with this increase in the high yield spread, Moody's Distressed Issuer index, which shows the percentage of speculative-grade issuers with debts trading at spreads to Treasuries greater than 1,000 basis points, also climbed sharply and now stands at  $52.6\%$  of speculative-grade issuers. Exhibit 12 shows the historical correlation between speculative-grade default rates,

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

high yield spreads, and Moody's Distressed Issuer index. The historical data suggest that movements in the high-yield spread often coincide with changes in the level of the speculative-grade default rate. During the last two credit cycles of 1990-91 and 2001-02, high yield bond spreads peaked at roughly 1,000 basis points, and were associated with peak speculative-grade default rates of roughly  $10 - 12\%$ . If this historical relationship were to hold up in this cycle, the recent peak of 2,000 basis points in the high yield spread suggests that speculative-grade default rates could approach  $20\%$ .

Exhibit 12

The current high default rate forecast also stems from deteriorating credit quality and increasing refunding risk for corporate issuers. As shown in Exhibit 13, at the beginning of 2009, the share of Caa-C issuers accounted for almost  $25\%$  of Moody's speculative-grade issuers, the highest level recorded since 1983. Moreover, roughly  $60\%$  of issuers currently rated Caa1 or below either have negative outlooks or are on watch for possible downgrades. In the current environment, lowly rated issuers are particularly vulnerable to default if they need to refinance maturing debt or obtain forbearance from covenant violations.

Exhibit 13

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

In addition to deteriorating credit quality, refunding risks are projected to increase over the next several years as more than one-half of current U.S. speculative-grade issuers have debts maturing in the next three years. As shown in Exhibit 14, measured by dollar volume, a total of  \$190 billion in debt is coming due over the next three years, which more than doubles the refunding needs of\$ 86 billion between 2008 and 2010<sup>9</sup>. This increase in issuers' refunding needs stems from maturing debt that was originated during the refinancing boom years of 2004-2007. Among Caa-C issuers, almost one-half have at least some debt maturing from 2009 to 2011.

Across geographical regions, the speculative default rate is expected to climb to  $15.8\%$  in the U.S. by year-end 2009, while the European default rate is expected to rise more sharply to  $19.6\%$ . Driving this differential is the currently weaker ratings mix among European speculative-grade issuers relative to U.S. issuers.

Exhibit 15 shows the baseline one-year default rate forecasts across industries in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., the consumer transportation industry, comprised mostly of airline companies, is expected to experience the highest default rate at over  $30\%$ . In Europe, the most troubled sector is expected to be durable consumer goods.

Besides forecasting default rates, the CTM can also forecast probabilities of upgrade and downgrade rates for all or any sub-group of Moody's-rated issuers. The CTM is currently forecasting that rating downgrades will continue to outnumber rating upgrades in 2009. The upgrade-to-downgrade ratio is anticipated to decline further to 0.2 in 2009 from 0.3 in 2008. Among investment-grade companies,  $5.8\%$  of issuers are expected to have their ratings downgraded to Ba1 or below in the coming twelve months. On the other hand, only  $1.6\%$  of speculative-grade issuers are expected to become rising stars in 2009.

# Recovery Outlook

As recovery rates are negatively correlated with default rates, Moody's expects recovery rates to decline in 2009 as default rates continue to increase. Moreover, recoveries are likely to be below historical averages as a result of strong loan issuance in recent years $^{10}$ . The increasing share of loans in issuers' liability structures implies less protection for loan investors because it entails a corresponding reduction in the share of total debt junior to the loans—which serves as a first-loss cushion for the loans in the event of default. For unsecured bond holders, the increasing loan shares imply more debt senior to the bonds and, therefore, lower recovery rates on those bonds. Based on Moody's current LGD assessments, the average expected recovery rate across all U.S. first lien loans is  $68\%$ , which compares with a historical average of  $87\%$  from Moody's ultimate recovery database. For senior unsecured bonds, the average expected recovery rate is  $33\%$ , which is also lower than historical average of  $40\%$  (see Exhibit 16). In light of the current economic slowdown, we also present the LGD outlook under regularand stress-downturn scenarios where firm-wide recovery rates average  $45\%$  and  $35\%$ , respectively. In the previous two credit cycles of 1991 and 2001, firm-wide recovery rates averaged roughly  $45\%$ . However, the current downturn, and its impact on firm-wide recovery rates, could certainly be more severe than those associated with the previous two credit cycles.

# Rating Accuracy Metrics

Moody's ratings have historically proven to be effective predictors of default. This is illustrated in Exhibit 17, which plots the average and median ratings of roughly 1,300 corporate issuers that defaulted from 1983 to 2008. The chart shows that Moody's-rated issuers have, on average, been downgraded to the Ba3 level as early as five years prior to default. Among issuers that defaulted in 2008, the average rating is Ba2 five years prior to default, which is slightly higher than its comparable historical average. In the year prior to default, 2008 defaulters' ratings were downgraded to B2 on average, which is comparable to historical average since 1983.

As a valuable tool to measure credit risk, ratings are expected to differentiate strong credits from weaker ones. In other words, an effective rating system should not only assign low ratings to issuers that ultimately default but also assign high ratings to those that are remote to default. A metric designed to measure this aspect of ratings performance is the cumulative accuracy profile (CAP) plot as shown in Exhibit 18. A rating system that possessed no predictive information about default risk would lie on the  $45^{\circ}$  line; the further the CAP curve

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

bows toward the northwest corner, the better it is at identifying defaults in the riskiest rating categories. Exhibit 18 shows that the CAP curve for 2008 lies below the one for the 1983-2008 period, which indicates a worse performance in 2008 relative to the historical average. The drop in rating performance in 2008 is largely the result of several investment-grade defaults in the banking and financial sectors, including Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and three Icelandic banks.

1. Moody's introduced alphanumericly modified Caa ratings in 1997. Caa letter ratings are mapped to Caa2 prior to 1997.

Another way to measure rating performance is the accuracy ratio, which is derived from the CAP curve. The accuracy ratio (AR) is the ratio of the area between the CAP curve and the  $45^{\circ}$  line, to the maximum possible area above the  $45^{\circ}$  line. AR values range from minus one to positive one and a higher AR indicates better rating accuracy. Exhibit 19 shows both oneand five-year horizon accuracy ratios for the period of 1983-2008. The graph suggests that the one-year accuracy ratio is positively correlated with the credit cycle: when defaults increase, the accuracy ratio falls. At the five-year horizon this correlation is much less evident. In the short run, the stability objective of Moody's rating system dampens rating changes; at longer time horizons, the stability objective is less of a constraint, and accuracy increases.

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

# Guide to Data Tables and Charts

In this section we briefly describe the interpretation of some of the Exhibits contained in this report. Methodological details are discussed in separate sections below.

Exhibit 11 presents Moody's speculative-grade default rate forecast for 2009. The model generated point forecasts for each month are shown, as well as forecasted optimistic and pessimistic bounds. The pessimistic and optimistic bounds represent positive and negative economic scenarios for the U.S. unemployment rate and high yield spread.

Exhibit 17 was derived by mapping Moody's ratings to a linear scale, then taking the average and median values of the numerically mapped ratings.

Exhibit 27 shows average senior unsecured recovery rates by letter rating and year prior to default. Each cell in the table indicates the average recovery rate on senior unsecured bonds with a specific rating within  $T$  years of default. For example, the  $35.4\%$  two-year B recovery rate reported in Exhibit 27 indicates that the average recovery rate on B rated issues that default at some time within a two-year period, not mean recovery rate for issuers rated B exactly two years before default.[11] Together with issuer-weighted average cumulative default rates, these multi-period recovery estimates are used to calculate cumulative expected credit loss rates, as presented in Exhibit 28.

Exhibits 38 through 42 show issuer-weighted historical average default rates by rating category over various investment horizons. These data were generated by averaging the multi-year default rates of cohorts formed at monthly intervals. In addition to being statements of historical fact, these data are also useful proxies for expected default rates. For example, over a five-year period a portfolio of B-rated issuers defaulted at a  $24.5\%$  average rate between 1983 and 2008 (see Exhibit 40). For an investor with a five-year exposure to a B-rated debt obligation or counterparty, this estimate also happens to be the best estimate of the expected risk of default for a B-rated exposure based on the available historical data, particularly over long investment horizons.

Exhibit 46 shows average cumulative volume-weighted default rates by rating category. Whereas issuer-based default rates weight each issuer equally, these data weight each issuer by the total volume of defaulted debt; larger defaults receive relatively more weight. Average default rates based on debt volume affected are less suitable estimates of expected default risk. One reason is that issuer default volumes vary considerably over time. On average, a leveraged corporate issuer defaults on approximately \$300 million of bonds. However, that total can be very high (e.g. \$30 billion for WorldCom). Issuer-based default rates receive particular emphasis in the rating process because the expected likelihood of default of a debt issuer holding a given rating is expected be the same regardless of differences in the nominal sizes of the exposures.

Exhibit 47 shows the cumulative issuer-weighted historical default rates of cohorts formed at annual intervals between the years 1970 and 2008 (January 1 of each year). These data are a subset of the data used to calculate the issuer-weighted averages shown in Exhibits 38 through 40 (which, again, are based on cohorts formed at monthly time intervals). The default rates in Exhibit 47 may be useful for scenario analysis. For example, if one believed that future default rates for a given pool of issuers will behave as they did in, say, 1997, then one can use the January 1, 1997 cohort cumulative default rates as proxies for expected default rates.

# Methodology and Data Sources

# Methodology Changes in this Year's Report

The historical data contained in Moody's 2009 global default study includes a number of revisions relative to previous years' publications. Moody's occasionally discovers historical defaults, leading to minor revisions of the historical data. As always, the data contained in the most recently published Moody's default study supersedes the data published in previous reports.

# Change in Senior Rating Algorithm

In January 2009, we applied a smoothing procedure in the senior rating algorithm to estimate every issuer's senior unsecured ratings. This enhancement aims to eliminate artificial rating changes that are not the result of a change in an issuer's credit quality, but due to a switch of reference debt on which the estimated senior unsecured rating is derived. The implementation of the smoothing procedure is particularly important when Moody's introduced new debt ratings, refined its rating scale, or adjusted its notching practices. For example, the introduction of issuer ratings on October 25 1999 results in numerous artificial rating changes if the smoothing procedure is not in place. At other times, the impact of the smoothing is modest. For instance, only  $3\%$  of Moody's-rated issuers have a different estimated senior unsecured rating (mostly by one notch) as of January 1, 2009 due to the introduction of the smoothing procedure.

# Removal of Special Purpose Vehicles

In January 2009, we removed a substantial number of special purpose vehicles from Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Principal Financial Group, Inc., and Protective Life Corporation. These SPVs are noninsurance conduits and mostly Aa3 or A1 credits. None of them had defaulted.

# Moody's Definition of Default

Moody's definition of default includes three types of credit events:

1. A missed or delayed disbursement of interest and/or principal;  
2. Bankruptcy, administration, legal receivership, or other legal blocks (perhaps by regulators) to the timely payment of interest and/or principal; or  
3. A distressed exchange occurs where: (i) the issuer offers debt holders a new security or package of securities that amount to a diminished financial obligation (such as preferred or common stock, or debt with a lower coupon or par amount, lower seniority, or longer maturity); and (ii) the exchange has the effect of allowing the issuer to avoid a bankruptcy or payment default.

The definition of a default is intended to capture events that change the relationship between debt holders and the debt issuer from the relationship which was originally contracted, and which subjects the bondholder to an economic loss. Technical defaults (covenant violations, etc.) are not included in Moody's definition of default. Secondary and tertiary defaults are reported only after the initial default event is believed to have been cured. This is to ensure that multiple defaults related to a single episode of credit distress are not over-counted.

# Rating Migration Calculations

A rating migration matrix completely summarizes changes in credit ratings over a given time horizon. The cells of the matrix are discrete-time estimates of rating migration probabilities. They show rate of rating change measured at two points in time; e.g. the start and end of one year. When calculating credit rating migration rates, Moody's treats rating changes, rating withdrawals, and defaults as mutually exclusive states. For example, an issuer that is downgraded on the day of default is counted only as a default, not a downgrade or a downgrade and default. Similarly, an issuer whose rating is withdrawn on the day of default is counted as a default, not a withdrawal.

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

The probability that an issuer's rating  $i$  held on cohort date  $y$  will transition to rating  $j$  (which includes default and withdrawal) over a time horizon  $T$  is calculated as:

$$
p _ {i j} ^ {y} (T) = \frac {n _ {i j} ^ {y} (T)}{n _ {i} ^ {y} (0)}
$$

The weighted average rating migration rate for all cohorts  $y$  in the historical data set  $Y$  is calculated as:

$$
\bar {p} _ {i j} (T) = \frac {\sum_ {y \in Y} n _ {i j} ^ {y} (T)}{\sum_ {y \in Y} n _ {i} ^ {y} (0)}
$$

# Default Rate Calculations

Moody's method for calculating cumulative default rates is a discrete-time approximation of the nonparametric continuous-time hazard rate approach. $^{12}$  Cumulative default rates are calculated from marginal default rates, which represent the probability that an issuer that has survived in the sample through a particular date will default over the next time interval (typically, one year) following that date.

The marginal default rate for issuers holding rating  $i$  on cohort date  $y$  is the ratio of the number of defaulting issuers in period  $t$  divided by the number of issuers exposed to the risk of default in period  $t$ .

$$
d _ {i} ^ {y} (t) = \frac {x _ {i} ^ {y} (t)}{n _ {i} ^ {y} (t) - x _ {i} ^ {y} (t - 1) - \frac {1}{2} [ w _ {i} ^ {y} (t) + w _ {i} ^ {y} (t - 1) ]}
$$

The denominator of the marginal default rate adjusts for defaults that occur prior to time interval  $t$ , as well as rating withdrawals,  $w(t)$ , that occur in periods prior to interval  $t$  and a small adjustment for withdrawals that occur in time interval  $t$ . Cumulative default rates for investment horizons of length  $T$ ,  $D(T)$ , are built up from the marginal default rates:

$$
D _ {i} ^ {y} (T) = 1 - \prod_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \left[ 1 - d _ {i} ^ {y} (t) \right]
$$

Or, expanding the above equation (and dropping indices for brevity):

$$
D (T) = d (1) + d (2) [ 1 - d (1) ] + d (3) [ (1 - d (1)) (1 - d (2)) ] + \dots + d (T) (\prod_ {t = 1} ^ {T - 1} [ 1 - d (t) ])
$$

In the first time period, a fraction of the credit exposures in the cohort either defaults or survives. The credit exposures that survive period one may then go on to default or survive in period two; those that survive period two may go on to default or survive in period three, etc. Because the time periods are non-overlapping and the probability of default in each period is assumed to be independent, the  $T$ -period cumulative default rate is defined as one minus the product of the  $T$  marginal survival rates.

The calculation of the average cumulative default rate for rating class  $i$ ,  $\overline{D}_i(T)$ , is derived from the weighted average marginal default rates,  $\overline{d}_i(t)$ , calculated from all the available cohort marginal default rates in the historical data set  $Y$ :

$$
\overline {{D}} _ {i} (T) = 1 - \prod_ {t = 1} ^ {T} [ 1 - \overline {{d}} _ {i} (t) ]
$$

# Corporate Default and Recovery Rates, 1920-2008

where

$$
\bar {d} _ {i} (t) = \frac {\sum_ {y \in Y} x _ {i} ^ {y} (t)}{\sum_ {y \in Y} n _ {i} ^ {y} (t)}
$$

The default rates calculated in multi-year rating migration matrices are not comparable to those calculated using Moody's discrete-time hazard rate method described above. Rating migration matrices account for rating withdrawals separately (in the column labeled WR) while the hazard rate method incrementally adjusts the denominator of the marginal default rate to remove rating withdrawals. Occasionally, withdrawal-adjusted rating migration matrices are calculated as follows:

$$
p _ {i j} ^ {y} (T) ^ {*} = \frac {p _ {i j} ^ {y} (T)}{(1 - p _ {i w} ^ {y} (T))}
$$

Using this method, all issuers whose ratings are withdrawn are removed. In effect, data for issuers whose ratings are withdrawn is completely discarded. This method generally yields higher default rate estimates than the hazard rate method. Hence, Moody's hazard rate-derived default rate estimates lay between unadjusted migration matrix-derived default rates and withdrawal-adjusted migration matrix-derived default rates.

# Recovery Rate Calculations

Moody's estimates defaulted debt recovery rates using market bid prices observed roughly 30 days after the date of default. Recovery rates are measured as the ratio of price to par value. Using post-default prices to measure recovery (or its complement, loss severity) parallels common practice in the credit default swaps market. Moreover, recovery rates measured in this way are most relevant for cash bond investors who liquidate their holdings shortly after default as often required by their portfolio governance rules or their own investment objectives. For investors holding defaulted securities until ultimate resolution, prices observed shortly after default are generally accepted as the market's estimate of discounted expected ultimate recovery rates.

The alternative approach of directly measuring ultimate realized recoveries presents a number of estimation challenges, including the appropriate discount rate to apply to cash-flows and valuing the assets used to pay creditor claims, which may include illiquid new securities (e.g., equity and derivative instruments) as well as physical assets. The table below defines the various ways Moody's calculates recovery rates. $^{13}$  For the purposes of measuring expected credit loss rates, we rely on issuer-weighted mean recovery rates.

<table><tr><td>Statistic</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td>Issuer-Weighted Mean Recovery Rates</td><td>They are derived by estimating mean recovery rates for each issuer, then averaging them across issuers.

# Credit Loss Rate Calculations

Moody's credit ratings are opinions of relative expected credit losses. Credit losses are therefore a function of both probability of default (PD) as well as the severity of default (LGD). The expected credit loss rate for rating category  $i$  is calculated as the product of the  $T$ -horizon average issuer-weighted default rate and the  $T$ -horizon average issuer-weighted senior unsecured loss severity rate (where  $r(T)$  is the average senior unsecured recovery rate at horizon  $T$ ):

$$
l _ {i} (T) = \bar {D} _ {i} (T) \times (1 - \bar {r} _ {i} (T))
$$

# CAP Curve and Accuracy Ratio

In addition to assigning low ratings to issuers that ultimately default, the effectiveness of a rating system depends on its ability to assign high credit ratings to issuers that do not default. In other words, an efficient rating system is able to separate the low credit risks from the high credit risks. A metric designed to measure this aspect of ratings performance is the cumulative accuracy profile (CAP) plot. $^{14}$  The CAP plot graphs the cumulative proportion of defaults from a portfolio (the y-axis) against the proportion of issuers exposed to the risk of default (the x-axis), sorted by riskiness. A rating system that randomly identified defaults from non-defaults would plot a line directly on the 45-degree line. The more powerful the discriminatory power of the rating system, the further the CAP curve bows toward the top left corner.

CAP curves are powerful tools for visualizing rating performance, but can be unwieldy from making comparisons over many time periods. A summary measure of rating accuracy that can be derived from the CAP curve is the accuracy ratio (AR). The accuracy ratio is the ratio of the area between the CAP curve and the 45-degree line to the total area above the 45-degree line. A rating system that perfectly differentiates defaults from non-defaults would score an AR of  $100\%$ , while a rating system that had zero predictive ability would score  $50\%$ .[15]

# Data Sources

Moody's bases the results of this study on its proprietary database of ratings and defaults for corporate bond and loan issuers. Municipal and sub-sovereign debt issuers, structured finance securities, private placements, and issuers with only short-term debt ratings are excluded unless otherwise noted. In total, Moody's data covers the credit experiences of over 18,000 corporate issuers that sold long-term public debt at some time between 1920 and 2008. As of January 1, 2008 approximately 6,000 corporate issuers held a Moody's long-term bond, loan, or corporate family rating.

Moody's database of corporate defaults covers over 3,600 long-term bond defaults by issuers both rated and non-rated by Moody's. Additional data sources, such as Lehman Brothers index data, supplemented Moody's proprietary data in the construction of the aggregate dollar volume-weighted default rates. Defaulted bond pricing data was derived from Bloomberg, Reuters, and TRACE. The majority of these market quotes represent an actual bid on the debt instrument, although no trade may have occurred at that price. Over the 1982-2008 period, the dataset consists includes post-default prices for approximately 3,000 defaulted instruments issued by over 1,400 defaulting corporations. Moody's makes the 1970-2008 credit rating, default, and recovery rate data used in this study available through its Default Risk Service (DRS) database.
