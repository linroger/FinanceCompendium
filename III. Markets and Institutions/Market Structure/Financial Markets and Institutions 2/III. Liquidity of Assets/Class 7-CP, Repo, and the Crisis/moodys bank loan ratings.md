# Moody's Bank Loan Ratings: Pricing Implications and Approach

The following Special Comment is based upon remarks made by Michael Dommermuth before the membership of the Kinsai Institute for Financial Affairs in New York on March 5, 1996.

# Introduction

The banks represented by this audience play a pivotal role in the pricing of syndicated loans. Syndicated loans often price at the margin--the incremental pricing needed to secure the next bank as a member of the syndicate group. Often times, that next bank is a Japanese bank operating in the U.S. commercial loan market. It is no coincidence then that a significant theme of today's discussion is risk-adjusted pricing on bank loans.

There are three topics today. First, I will discuss the convergence of the commercial bank loan and bond markets. Convergence will most likely help banks to manage risk and it will better enable them to seek out economic rewards that are more clearly in line with the risks they assume.

Second, I will talk about how we see the role of ratings and how we intend to serve the loan market. Third, I will summarize our approach to rating bank loans.

# Convergence

According to many market participants, we are on the cusp of permanent change in the U.S. syndicated loan market. The bank loan market is becoming more complex. With the passage of time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the securities and loan markets notwithstanding the artificial distinctions created by differences in regulatory treatment (see Chart 1). A growing number of institutional, fixed-income investors no longer feel limited to the securities market. In fact, they are prepared to buy whatever debt obligation provides the best return on a risk-adjusted basis.

This change has also brought about new classes of investors. First, there are the prime funds-- closed-end mutual funds whose major asset consists of syndicated loans and who provide a variable rate of return to their largely retail clientele. There are also the Close, or collateralized loan obligation funds, who use the proceeds from highly-rated bond issues to acquire portfolios of syndicated loans. Close attempt to arbitrage pricing differences between the loan and securities markets (see Appendix A for a listing of Close currently rated by Moody's).

Likewise, a growing number of commercial banks are recasting themselves as loan portfolio managers who are prepared to buy and sell loans, depending on their particular needs to manage return and risk. Several banks, for example, have established specialized loan funds that are marketed to institutional investors.

As the major commercial agent-banks encroached on the traditional turf of the securities firms and began to underwrite bond issues, the securities firms responded predictably. Today, many "bulge bracket" securities firms market their ability to offer their clients "one-stop shopping." Now, not only do they underwrite and trade securities and provide advisory services, they also originate, syndicate, trade and hold loans for their own account.

As the composition of the loan market changes, it is becoming increasingly liquid. Last year, there was over \$30 billion in one-side trading volume. Though only a small portion of all loans are currently traded, Moody's believes that trading activity will increase significantly when a better balance is achieved between the supply and demand for funds.

These changes will have a profound impact on buy/sell decision-making and overall loan management.

Chart 1: Convergence: A Blurring of Distinctions

There are many contributors to convergence, but some of the key drivers are: (a) a concern on the part of regulators and others that loans may be mispriced, thereby weakening the U.S. banking system and contributing to disintermediation of the banks to the securities markets*; (b) a strong desire on the part of the commercial banks to mitigate risk through active portfolio management techniques; and (c) a generalized relaxation of Glass-Steagall.

In deciding how Moody's could best serve the needs of the marketplace during this time of change, we spoke with a number of market participants. The consensus view expressed to us was that they wanted a more efficient market. They wanted the ability to identify pricing anomalies between the loan and securities markets. Once identified, they wanted the ability to exploit these anomalies. That

meant that they also needed a more liquid market. They generally embraced the notion of convergence, believing that deeper participation in the market would be helpful in promoting market liquidity. What is more, they felt that overlapping participation between the securities and loan markets on the part of institutional investors was inevitable, as well as beneficial. They also wanted a more stable environment. By that, they meant that they wanted to raise the level of transparency as to the risk elements contained in credit facilities, and they wanted a framework for discussion of these risk elements. To be fair, not everyone in the banking community shares these views. Strong divisions of opinion exist not only between banks but within banks. Moody's believes that these divisions are to be expected for a market that is changing so dramatically.

# The Role of Ratings

Moody's bank loan ratings were designed with a view to achieving the market's objectives. What we intend to do is not terribly innovative and it does not represent radical new thinking. In its broadest sense, we intend to serve the bank loan market in the same way that we have served so many other markets, including the Eurobond, Euroyen, and structured finance markets. In fact, we believe that interesting parallels exist between the loan market as it stands today and the junk bond market of the early 1980's. At that time, the junk bond market was dominated by a single underwriter. It was characterized as having a relatively shallow investor base and was not terribly liquid. It was also largely an unrated market. Many of the issues Moody's faces in its attempt to best serve the loan market are the same issues we faced in the junk bond market.

Today, the junk bond market bears only passing resemblance to what it was. Junk bonds are no longer dominated by a single underwriter, but feature many underwriters. The market benefits from an investor base that is expanding and it is becoming more liquid. Also, almost all new junk bond offerings carry debt ratings.

With this history in mind, Moody's intends to serve the bank loan market in three ways. First, we believe our ratings and research will make the market more transparent and therefore will facilitate a framework for risk-adjusted pricing. Second, we hope to provide the broad ratings coverage that market participants have asked for. Third, we intend to do our best to have our ratings and research available in a timely fashion.

I would like to talk about each of these three contributions in greater detail, focusing first on a framework for risk-adjusted pricing.

# A Framework for Risk-Adjusted Pricing

Moody's approach to the rating of the bank loan market was based upon a few beliefs. First, we believe that the securities market prices for risk more efficiently than the loan market. We believe that is so because active secondary market trading captures material new information and its associated impact on price somewhat better than loan pricing grids. It is also a more efficient market because there are fewer regulatory-related pricing distortions. For example, mutual funds do not have to set aside capital against their holdings. It is also a more transactional environment where relationship issues count less heavily in establishing price.

Second, we believe conventions used in the loan market result in mispricing of some bank loans. One such convention is the so-called "notching" convention. Syndicated loans are often priced as if they were rated one-refined rating notch above the same company's senior unsecured bonds or two refined rating notches above its subordinated bonds. We believe that this convention does not adequately capture the real differences in risk that can exist at different points in a company's capital structure.

Third, Moody's would tend to agree with regulators that a truer balance between risk and reward is probably beneficial to the banking community. If banks price a "good" credit too richly, they will provide motivation for that borrower to turn to the securities market, leaving the banks with the loans of less-creditworthy borrowers whose loans are priced too cheaply. Ultimately, such an imbalance will erode the capital position of the commercial banks as default rates reach cyclical highs.

Because market participants are looking for greater transparency in the bank loan market--an ability to make risk-return comparisons with other securities markets, Moody's decided to use its traditional rating scale in rating bank loans. These ratings facilitate a framework for the marketplace that enables price transferal from the securities market to the loan market. Using traditional ratings, participants in loan syndications can, for example, compare the pricing of a Ba2-rated bank loan to that of a large diversified portfolio of Ba2 bonds having similar duration. Moody's also chose to use its traditional rating scale because it had already become part and parcel of the language and culture of the bank loan market. Pricing grids, for example, often are based upon a company's bond ratings.

However, loans are not bonds. In fact, the average recovery on a defaulted bank loan tends to be materially higher than on defaulted, unsecured bonds--especially for the loans of non-investment grade borrowers (leveraged loans). Leveraged loans have higher average recoveries because of structural and collateral issues that are not typically present in unsecured bonds.

Traditional ratings are, however, well-suited for the loan market because Moody's long-term ratings have always been measures of expected loss. They are not frequency-only measures. Moody's long-term ratings are meant to reflect not only the likelihood of default, but also our expectations for the extent of loss should default occur. That is why senior unsecured bonds are rated higher, on average, than the subordinated bonds of the same company. While the likelihood of default on these two instruments is the same, the average recovery on senior unsecured bonds is significantly better than on subordinated bonds. This is the same reason why Moody's usually rates leveraged bank loans from one to three refined rating notches above the senior unsecured bond rating of the same company, or one to four refined rating notches above the same company's subordinated bond rating (see Chart 2).

Graph 1 shows cumulative expected losses on bonds rated by Moody's using 58 years of default information (please refer to Moody's Special Comment, Corporate Bond Defaults and Default Rates 1938-1995, published January 1996). For example, the expected losses on diversified portfolios of B1 to B3 rated bonds and Ba3 to Ba1 rated bonds are  $15.6\%$  and  $6.2\%$ , respectively, over five years. The data shown in this graph reflects historical performance; it may not necessarily be reflective of future ratings performance, although Moody's has no reason to believe future performance will be materially different.

A key objective of Moody's is to ensure consistency of its ratings regardless of the type of capital market instrument to which the rating applies. A Ba2 rated bank loan, for example, should have the same risk attributes as a Ba2 rated bond. Therefore, with the passage of time, the cumulative loss experience of bank loans should be similar to that of same-rated bonds.

Graph 2 shows recovery experience of capital market instruments as measured by bond prices one month following an event of default. The line represents median recovery per every \$100 of bonds issued. The bars show average recovery plus and minus one standard deviation about the mean. Therefore, the bars show where two-thirds of all recoveries on defaulted bonds occur. Although there is only limited information on loss recovery experience available in the public domain, Moody's experience suggests that median recoveries on bank loans are substantially higher than on senior secured bonds. But the variability about mean recoveries on bank loans is as wide as is evidenced in all other capital market instruments.

This graph has many important implications. First, it supports our intuitive understanding of the linkage between seniority of claim and recovery experience. As creditors move up the capital structure, they are more likely to improve recovery prospects. There may be many reasons for the relatively small difference in median recovery between senior secured and senior unsecured bonds. But one important reason for the small difference is that bank creditors often take security over a company's best assets, leaving secured bond creditors with less liquid and less valuable assets.

Second, the high degree of variability about average recovery experience suggests that rigid application of notching conventions is simply not supported by observed performance. More simply put, ratings must be assigned to capital market instruments based upon the substance of what they are versus what they are called. If Moody's believes, for example, that a senior unsecured bond is likely to experience losses consistent with a senior subordinated bond in default, then the rating assigned to the senior unsecured bond should reflect that judgment.

The highly variable recovery experience equally suggests that rigid application of notching conventions does not adequately reflect reality for bank loans either. This is an important consideration. Participants in the syndicated loan market inform us that bank loans often price as if they were one refined rating notch higher than the same company's senior unsecured bonds or two refined rating notches above its senior subordinated bonds. Clearly, the high degree of variability in recovery experience suggests that such notching conventions may often result in the mispricing of bank loans.

As Graph 3 shows, the ratings Moody's has assigned to bank loans have a much greater range than market notching conventions would suggest. Moody's bank loan ratings are one to four refined rating notches higher than the same company's senior subordinated bond ratings (Moody's compares bank loan ratings to senior subordinated bond ratings for the reason that the majority of all non-investment grade companies have no senior unsecured bonds outstanding). In fact, the ratings that Moody's has assigned to bank loans suggest that the market's notching convention would result in inaccurate pricing on  $40\%$  of all syndicated loans.

If it is true that the market's convention for pricing loans results in mispricing; it is also true that indices of pricing are inaccurate. One practice used by market commentators is to quote drawn LIBOR spreads grouped by companies' bond ratings. For example, one common approach to quote pricing is to select loan facilities of companies who have Ba2 ratings assigned to their bond issues. An average of drawn LIBOR spreads are then calculated and quoted. This practice is misleading, however, due in large part to the sometimes large differences that can arise between a company's bank loan ratings and that same company's senior unsecured bond rating. A basket of facilities of companies whose bonds are rated Ba2 may include loans that are rated Ba2 to Baa3.

Graph 3: Bank Loan vs. Subordinated Bond Ratings of the Same Company

A more accurate means of pricing is on a same rating (same risk) basis. Instead of grouping all companies whose bonds are rated Ba2, for example, it is more accurate to quote pricing based upon all facilities that are rated Ba2.

Using this new approach to loan pricing, Graph 4 shows drawn LIBOR spreads for facilities Moody's has rated compared to historical expected loss experience over an 18 month duration. As the

graphs show, drawn LIBOR spreads exceed expected loss experience for facilities rated Baa3 to Ba3. It is not clear why expected losses exceed drawn LIBOR spreads for lower-rated facilities, although there are at least two possible explanations. First, it is possible that the results are a statistical aberration due to small sample size. There are only about 20 facilities that Moody's rates B2, for example. Some market participants, however, suggest that there is an implicit glass ceiling to LIBOR spreads, above which bankers are reluctant to go. If this hypothesis is in fact correct, it would suggest that participants in B1 and B2 rated bank loans are being inadequately compensated for risk.

Of course, this comparison of LIBOR spreads and expected loss assumes that loans have, on average, an 18 month duration. Cumulative expected losses are higher for longer durations. What is more, this comparison assumes that all loans have an equal propensity to prepay. This is, of course, not the case. It is more accurate to say that loans of more creditworthy borrowers are more likely to be prepaid than is true of less creditworthy borrowers or the loans that are more likely to experience default. This logic suggests that longer durations should be used in comparing drawn LIBOR spreads to expected loss.

Often, comparisons are made between the LIBOR-equivalent pricing of a company's bonds to its bank loans. This type of comparison is helpful in supporting an already existing intuitive understanding of risk. Such comparisons usually show that the pricing on a non-investment grade company's bank loans is lower than on its bonds. The lower pricing on loans is not surprising because loans usually represent a lower risk than unsecured bonds. This approach to pricing analysis, however, is limited by the fact that wide differences can exist between the credit quality of a company's bonds and bank loans.

More meaningful and revealing comparisons can be made using the same data on a risk adjusted basis. In other words, by comparing the pricing on loans and bonds rated at the same level as shown in Graph 5. This graph uses information published in Loan Pricing Corporation's Gold Sheets Relative Value Analysis. However, rather than group pricing by company, Moody's has taken the same information and arranged it by the actual rating we have assigned to each loan and to each bond. Using this approach, it becomes easier to detect pricing aberrations between same-rated loans and bonds.

# Ratings Coverage

Moody's will ultimately provide the market the rating coverage it wants in facilitating efficiencies. Since Moody's announced its intention to rate bank loans in April, 1995, it has rated over 415 facilities of 210 companies amounting to over \$96 billion (see Graph 6 for Moody's cumulative ratings coverage as well as Appendix B for a listing of facilities currently rated by Moody's). Coverage for

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/1c4e5ae2-64e6-464b-a2e7-f456c0068949/33fc255f59bc4bfe8d2fb5351c003696c791b3af5f94bf097a481cd2221ec51e.jpg)  
Graph 5: A New Framework for Risk-Adjusted Pricing Comparisons

coverage's sake is not an objective of Moody's. Rather, we would like to provide ratings coverage only in circumstances where we believe it brings clear value to the marketplace. Moody's has three tests for value. First, the loan is likely to be drawn. This first test usually precludes the rating of CP backstop facilities, for example. Second, the loan must be capable of being traded either through assignment or participating interests. Third, Moody's must believe that there is enough information available to express an accurate opinion of risk.

With regard to this last test of value, we should note that only 13 companies do not already carry bond ratings from Moody's of the 210 companies whose bank loans have now been rated. Of the 13 unrated companies, virtually all were subsidiaries of companies who did carry bond ratings from Moody's at the time the bank loans were rated. In addition, Moody's has always believed that an understanding of a company's loan facilities plays a critical role in developing an understanding of the risks inherent in that company's bond obligations. Loan covenants, loan structure, and structural sub-ordination issues are all critical credit considerations that must be reflected in the rating of the bonds (see "Moody's Investors Service: Global Credit Analysis," published by IFR Books, 1991). Therefore, Moody's has always sought information on a rated company's facilities even well before our announcement that we would be rating bank loans.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/1c4e5ae2-64e6-464b-a2e7-f456c0068949/d4149d7e13170180b37bd7f3d349ff82b8f1b5d1aedbb95a41478fe526dd3530.jpg)  
Graph 6: Moody's Cumulative Ratings Coverage

Although Moody's often reviews the "bank book" in rating new facilities, we view these documents with skepticism. While bank books do provide useful summary information as to the proposed terms and conditions of the facility agreements, Moody's believes that these documents are often primarily used as sales tools by the agent bank in facilitating the syndication process. A more reliable approach to rating bank loans, in our opinion, is to review the contractual obligations of all the parties, including upstream/downstream guarantee language, the credit facility agreement, any inter-creditor agreements, security agreements, and related contractual agreements.

# The Timing of Opinion-Making

Although not always possible, Moody's believes that it is more valuable to the marketplace if we are able to render our rating opinions before prospective participants make the decision to participate in a new syndication. Thus, Moody's makes every effort to issue ratings following the bank meeting, but on or prior to the commitment date (see Chart 3).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/1c4e5ae2-64e6-464b-a2e7-f456c0068949/65ce4274ca6075a3817cc62e2e3cb7bf38ee039a1eaf74a12be31e011050238e.jpg)  
Chart 3: Timing of Opinion-making

However, it should be noted that facility agreements may change prior to loan closing. Consequently, Moody's makes use of its prospective ratings denoted by a (P) before the rating. Prospective ratings are an indication of what we believe that the final rating will be upon loan closing. If a material change to a loan facility is made prior to closing that Moody's did not anticipate, the final rating of that facility may well be different than the prospective rating.

# Moody's Approach to Rating Bank Loans

Moody's uses the same approach to rating loans as we would to any other type of debt obligation (see "Moody's Investors Service: Global Credit Analysis," published by IFR Books, 1991). The same analyst who is responsible for rating and monitoring the ratings assigned to a company's senior unsecured bonds, subordinated bonds, preferred stock and commercial paper is likewise responsible for assessing and monitoring that company's bank loans. The rating committee process is also the same. However, additional analysts may be brought into the committee process because of the incremental analytic issues brought to bear in the rating of loans.

Loans are not bonds, and it is certainly true that most loans require additional analysis. The incremental considerations involved in bank loan analysis can be categorized along six broad headings: (1) loan structure; (2) capital structure; (3) collateral security; (4) bankruptcy-related legal issues; and (5) covenants.

# Loan Structure

A seemingly obvious, but crucial first step for the analyst is to understand which entity within the corporate structure is the actual obligor under the facility agreements. While loans at the non-operating, holding company level may well present issues of structural subordination, more often these issues are in whole or in part negated by the presence of upstream guarantees (see Chart 4). Even at the holding company level, bank creditors gain proximity to assets to the extent that guarantees are secured by the most valuable operating assets of the operating subsidiaries and to the extent that the guarantees are legal, valid, binding, and enforceable. In point of bankruptcy, unsecured guarantees are less effective in mitigating loss since obligations of the guarantor rank pari pasu with all other senior unsecured obligations of the obligor. In this regard, Moody's experience suggests that it is difficult to fully anticipate all competing claims against a company's assets.

Holding company loans that are supported by a pledge of the stock in the operating company are not generally considered effective loss mitigants except in special circumstances. A pledge of stock in an operating company whose financial prospects are not materially linked in any way to the financial fortunes of the holding company may be considered a valuable asset, particularly in instances where, in the event that the pledge were to be enforced, the owner of the stock could liquidate its holdings quickly without a material diminution in value. More commonly, however, the value of the pledged stock is intimately connected to the solvency of the holding company and may be worthless as an asset in bankruptcy.

Chart 4: Loan Structure

Mandatory Prepayments. Mandatory prepayment provisions refer to circumstances in which the borrower must repay all or part of loan amounts outstanding. Two common instances in which early repayments must be made relate to significant asset sales and excess cash flow (cash flow amounts that exceed a prescribed amount). To the extent that loan amounts outstanding are repaid early, thereby accelerating the normal amortization schedule of the loan, the lenders' exposure to loss is reduced and the overall riskiness of the loan is reduced. There is, however, an inverse correlation between the desirability of an early repayment and the likelihood that mandatory prepayment provision will be invoked, thereby reducing its effectiveness as a risk mitigant. For example, the cash flows of a borrower experiencing financial distress usually fall below the excess cash flow trigger mechanisms. Equally, when rating a newly originated loan, it is often difficult to forecast that the borrower will in fact effect major asset sales with any degree of certainty.

The other key aspect of mandatory prepayment provisions Moody's examines is whether prepayments are applied on a pro-rata basis to all its term loans and revolving facilities, or are first applied to a single facility. For example, Moody's rated Westinghouse's short-dated term loan higher (Baa3)

than its other facilities (Ba1). In this case, mandatory prepayments were first applied to the earlier maturing term tranche and Moody's was confident that Westinghouse would in fact effect major asset sales within a relatively short time frame.

Another variation on this theme is a cash flow sweep. This provides for some or all of a company's free cash flow to be applied toward loan repayment. These "sweeps" continue until either (a) certain financial hurdles are met (implying improved financial conditions); or (b) the loan is repaid in its entirety.

Springing Liens. Springing liens usually refer to circumstances in which the lenders may take security over a company's assets. From a credit perspective they are usually less effective as a risk mitigant than a perfected first security interest in tangible assets. Numerous circumstances can be envisioned where lenders would have difficulty establishing a perfected lien on a company's assets at the time when the lien is most advantageous--when the borrower is experiencing financial distress (see Moody's Special Comment, Trigger Happy, published December 1995)). However, some springing liens are better structured than others. Those that are structured such that the borrower would not be able to impede the ability of the lenders to perfect their security interest and those that are structured such that the provisions of the bankruptcy code are less likely to imperil the lenders' lien on assets are generally viewed more favorably than others.

Springing liens can sometimes also refer to circumstances where the lenders must release their collateral security (referred to as "reverse springing" liens). The circumstances in which security may be released usually refer to the improving credit quality of the borrower. Federated's bank facilities permit the lien over its assets to be released, for example, upon becoming an investment grade credit. In that particular case, Moody's assigned the same rating to Federated's secured bank facilities as it did to its senior unsecured bonds (Ba1). In considering reverse springing liens, Moody's focuses on the likelihood that the lien on a borrower's assets will be released.

Inter-creditor Agreements. Inter-creditor agreements are contractual arrangements between two or more sets of lenders under two or more distinct loan deals that are meant to equalize each set of lenders exposure to loss should default occur. The terms of the inter-creditor agreement usually prescribe that the proceeds from liquidated assets will be shared on a pro-rata basis between the different lender groups. For example, a company may have one loan deal at the holding company level and one at the operating company, each with different sets of collateral security. While on the surface the two facilities would appear to represent different risks, the presence of an inter-creditor agreement may equalize the risks inherent in each of the facilities because relative recovery under the two facilities would be equal in point of default. In assessing inter-creditor agreements, Moody's primarily focuses on two key issues. First, is there a pro-rata sharing of the proceeds from liquidated assets? Second, is the agreement likely to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable?

Escrow Accounts. Lenders will sometimes establish an escrow account in which the proceeds from the loan are deposited. Amounts from the escrow account are only released to the borrower if certain conditions are met. To the extent that the borrower defaults or is otherwise considered insolvent, the lenders may recapture moneys remaining in the escrow account, thereby reducing their exposure to loss. The presence of an escrow account was particularly helpful, for example, in reducing the risk of loss of the lenders to Harrah's Jazz under its bank facility.

# Capital Structure

In rating any of a company's debt obligations, an assessment of its capital structure is critical. Such an examination reveals the extent to which debt ranked lower in the capital structure will provide a cushion or buffer of protection against the risk of loss on obligations ranked more highly. Moody's believes that there is no single correct approach to assessing capital structure, but three approaches tend to dominate our analysis: (a) the distressed asset value approach; (b) the sustainable debt approach; and (c) the enterprise value approach. Regardless of the approach taken, the prospective nature of Moody's ratings suggest that it is important not only to consider a company's existing capital structure, but also possible changes in capital structure during the term of the facility.

The Distressed Asset Value Approach. Using this approach to capital structure analysis, the analyst assesses the amount of cushion against the risk of loss by comparing a company's secured debt to the value of the pledged assets under distressed circumstances (see Chart 5). This approach to assessing capital structure is most relevant in circumstances where (a) the lenders have a lien on some or all of a company's assets and (b) the company may well enter bankruptcy as a liquidating concern rather than a going concern. Even if a company is likely to remain a going concern should default occur, distressed asset values are a reasonably reliable proxy for the amount of negotiating strength the secured lenders will have relative to other creditors during bankruptcy proceedings. As such, it is predictive of the risk of loss for many types of companies.

Chart 5: Capital Structure--The Distressed Asset Value Approach

In determining the value of assets in distressed circumstances it is tempting to apply standard discounts to broad asset classes (e.g.,  $80\%$  of accounts receivable,  $50\%$  to inventories, etc.). Such an approach, however, tends to be oversimplifying. In reality, for example, some accounts receivable retain value in distressed circumstances more than others. Moody's therefore has adopted a case-by-case analysis of the secured assets where qualitative judgment plays an important role. While standard discounting of broad asset groups is inappropriate, it is true that, on average, some broad asset groups tend to be better collateral security than others. Receivables often provide better protection than inventories, which are often better than property, plant and equipment. Here are some of the major issues Moody's considers in examining each of the major asset types:

(i) Accounts Receivables--quality of obligors; concentration of obligors; type of obligors; turnover; diversification of accounts; loss experience; and potential for dilution.  
(ii)Inventory--state of inventory (e.g., finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials); type of inventory (e.g., perishable or non-perishable); risk of obsolescence; fashion risk; location of inventories (e.g., inventories at supplier locations are sometimes more difficult to seize); inventory turnover; accounts payable and the extent to which suppliers may claw back inventories.  
(iii)Property, Plant & Equipment--(i) possible presence of environmental hazards; (ii) depth of prospective acquirers; (iii) cost of constructing new PP&E versus buying existing PP&E; (iv) relative efficiency of PP&E versus state-of-the-art; (v) cyclicality of borrower's industry and linkage to the value of PP&E in point of bankruptcy; (vi) recent appraisals; and (vii) separability of PP&E for liquidation purposes.  
(iv)Pledge of Subsidiary Stock--(i) correlation between the financial health of the borrowing entity and that of the subsidiary or affiliate; and (ii) the secondary liquidity of the pledged stock under distressed circumstances.

More generally, when assessing distressed asset values, Moody's focuses on four broad factors (see Chart 7). First, how highly correlated is the value of the pledged assets to the solvency of the borrower? The value of the major operating company's stock is usually highly correlated with the solvency of the holding company, for example. Second, how liquid are the assets in distressed circumstances? Accounts receivable, for example, are usually more liquid than a piece of equipment within a plant. Third, how stable or predictable are asset values? Certain commodity products are highly liquid, but also their value often changes almost daily. Fourth, what unique characteristics of the pledged assets could impact value? For example, are the assets prone to obsolescence (e.g., high technology), perishable (e.g., non-dry grocery goods), or subject to fashion risk (e.g., textiles).

Sustainable Debt Analysis. The valuation of a company's assets is sometimes an inaccurate predictor of recovery prospects. This would be the case, for example, for certain types of service-based companies whose balance sheets reflect a low level of assets versus revenues. Therefore, another approach used by Moody's to assess recovery prospects is to presume that the borrower must restructure and reduce its debt load in distressed circumstances (see Chart 7). The question then becomes, in emerging from its restructuring, how much debt can the company sustain while remaining a viable, going concern (i.e., sustainable debt in distressed circumstances)?

Chart 7: Sustainable Debt Analysis

Moody's derives sustainable debt by first assessing a company's core EBITDA. In other words, we attempt to gauge what level of earnings can be relied upon regardless of industry or macroeconomic conditions. From these earnings, we adjust for the minimum levels of capital expenditures the company will require to adequately maintain its core businesses, as well as for the company's working capital requirements. The resulting cash flow is intended to measure the amount of cash generated and available to service interest expense. Dividing this result by some average measure of the interest rates applicable to a company's debt yields the amount of debt a company can sustain in distressed circumstances. As with all of these approaches to assessing a company's capital structure, judgment plays a critical role in the analysis, given its prospective nature. It is equally important that the analyst also consider the degree of variability about the expected outcome.

# Enterprise Valuation Approach.

The third way to assess a company's capital structure is to compare it to the value of the enterprise under distressed circumstances. Like the sustainable debt analysis, this approach treats the company as a going concern. It is an approach that is particularly useful in circumstances where the book assets of a company do not adequately reflect their real economic worth.

The determination of enterprise value is, at best, a matter of judgment in large part reflecting the prospective nature of the analysis. Merger and acquisition activity relating to other, comparable companies, or indeed the borrower itself, reveals the range of multiples that these companies currently trade at. However, they may well not be indicative of the multiples that the borrower may trade at in distressed circumstances. Rather, the analyst must make two determinations. First, what are the key drivers of current multiples and how could these drivers change over time (e.g., are current multiples artificially high due to cyclical trends in the industry rather than secular ones)? Second, what is the company's core level of cash flow expected to be in distressed circumstances?

# Term Tranches: Differential Risk?

We are often asked if later maturing tranches of a multi-tranched term loan deal should be rated differently to reflect the differences in risk associated with each tranche. The short answer is, not usually.

First, Moody's ratings typically ignore differences in maturity. Five-year senior unsecured bonds of a company are rated the same as its ten-year senior unsecured bonds. Moody's does, however, recognize that longer-dated bonds or loans tend to carry a higher cumulative chance of default than shorter-dated bonds. This difference in risk is in fact reflected in Moody's default studies, which show a steady increase in the likelihood of default with the passage of time. Investors as well have long recognized that later maturities often mean more risk and they reflect that incremental risk into the pricing of bonds. Longer-dated bonds typically trade at wider spreads than do shorter-dated bonds.

The alternative to this approach is to adjust the rating assigned to the bonds each day as the bonds approach maturity. Using this approach, a company could have a wide range of ratings assigned to all its bond issues ranging from B3 to Aaa. Investors inform us that this would be confusing and probably damaging to the efficiency of the market. Similarly, maturity differences alone are not enough to distinguish the ratings of each of the term tranches.

There are, however, instances in which Moody's could rate each of the term tranches differently: first, if each of the term tranches had materially different collateral security; second, if each of the term tranches had different seniority in bankruptcy; third, if mandatory prepayment provisions were not applied on a pro-rata basis and it was likely that meaningful amounts of prepayments would occur.

# Legal Considerations

A variety of legal issues, mostly relating to the bankruptcy code, are featured in Moody's overall risk assessment. Some of the more important considerations are as follows:

Perfected security interest. Do the lenders have a first, perfected security interest in the collateral? Also of importance, will the administrative agent oversee the security interest in such a way that it is highly unlikely other creditors will secure a more senior ranking claim to the assets (e.g., the administrative agent fails to record changes in the location of the assets or the name of the borrower)?

Prior ranking claims. Pursuant to section 507 of the bankruptcy code, a variety of creditors may rank senior to the claims of even the senior secured lenders, including: (a) administrative expenses; (b) unpaid wages, salaries, or commissions; (c) unpaid taxes; and (d) contributions to employee benefit plans. Moody's therefore examines the extent to which such senior ranking claims may reduce recoveries available to the lenders.

**Preferential transfers.** Pursuant to section 547 of the bankruptcy code, certain transfers made to creditors, as well as certain liens, may be voided by the bankruptcy trustee. The preference period extends from 90 days to 1 year depending upon whether the beneficiary of the transfer or lien was considered an "insider." The risks associated with preferential transfers are accentuated for the most risky borrowers who are in imminent risk of being considered insolvent for purposes of the bankruptcy code.

**Priming liens.** Section 364 of the bankruptcy code governs the hierarchy of available means by which a debtor in possession may obtain additional financing, including the potential for a lender of new money to obtain a security interest on assets assigned to a pre-petition secured lender. In most cases, it may be argued that collateral at 1.5 times coverage plus a substantial equity cushion, for example, is not excessive in providing adequate protection to the amount of the pre-petition, secured lender's claim. Importantly, this lender's rights extend not only to the principal amount of the loan, but also to any accrued interest and costs during the bankruptcy period. However, should a court determine that a new money, secured loan would enhance the value of the pre-petition claim such that the pre-petition lender would be considered adequately protected, then some portion of the pre-petition claim on assets might be released in favor of a new money lender. An overabundance of asset protection is difficult to prove and a reassignment of collateral rights rarely transpires without the pre-petition lender receiving a replacement lien.

Legal, valid, binding, and enforceable obligations. Moody's will form a judgment as to whether it is reasonable to assume that the obligors under the loan agreements will be legally required to perform their obligations in accordance with the terms of the contracts.

# Covenants

Covenants indirectly help creditors to the extent that they limit the financial actions of management. Covenants also act as early warning indicators of trouble, allowing the lenders to either extract concessions from management or to accelerate debt when an event of default has occurred.

More generally, however, loan structure, collateral, and capital structure are more predictive of the ratings Moody's has assigned to bank loans than is covenant structure. The voting rights contained in many facility agreements provide for frequent changes to the affirmative and negative covenants, more often than not, resulting in a weakening of the covenants. In this regard, the covenants contained in bank facilities sharply contrast with the protections commonly available within security indentures. For companies that must file their facility agreements with the SEC, it is not uncommon to also find at least one and possibly many more amendments to the original agreement. As such, Moody's considers many affirmative and negative covenants of a highly dilutive nature, which undermines their value as a predictive tool of risk.

# Monitoring

Moody's actively monitors the ratings it has assigned to bank facilities in the same way that it monitors the ratings assigned to bonds. As significant changes occur in the underlying credit fundamentals affecting a borrower or a specific facility, the ratings concerned may be placed under review for possible downgrade or upgrade. Alternatively, the ratings may be downgraded or upgraded without being first placed under review, where warranted.

Since Moody's began rating bank loans in April 1995, the facilities of 10 companies have been either upgraded or downgraded. Though this represents a lower degree of ratings volatility relative to changes in bond ratings, Moody's fully expects that bank loan rating volatility will converge with the degree of volatility seen in its bond ratings as we expand our loan ratings coverage.
