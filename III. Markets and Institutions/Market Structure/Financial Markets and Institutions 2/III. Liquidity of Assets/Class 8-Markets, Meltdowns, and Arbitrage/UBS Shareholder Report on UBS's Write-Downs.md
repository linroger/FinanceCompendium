## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

In 2007 and in relation to the first quarter of 2008, UBS AG ("UBS") has made several announcements of losses incurred in relation to structuring, trading and investment activities in mortgage and asset-backed securities, in particular with respect to securities referencing US "Subprime" residential mortgages. UBS first announced Subprime-related losses in connection with the closure of Dillon Read Capital Management ("DRCM") in May 2007.1 UBS ultimately reported net losses of USD 18.7 bn in relation to US residential mortgage sector exposures for the year ended 31 December 2007 (the "Subprime Losses").

The Swiss Federal Banking Commission ("EBK") requested that UBS report to it the key facts relevant to understanding the principal root causes leading to the Subprime Losses. Based on UBS's current knowledge of the facts, UBS reported on 7 April 2008 on the factual basis of UBS's Subprime Losses, as well as a preliminary analysis of the root causes leading to such losses. UBS has not yet provided a comprehensive report to the EBK on remediation or other actions taken (or to be taken). UBS will formally discuss these matters with the EBK at a later date and will then communicate them to its shareholders in due course.

This Shareholder Report (the "Shareholder Report") sets out UBS's key findings, including the principal causes of the Subprime Losses UBS identified in retrospect following an internal review of the various businesses incurring the Subprime Losses. While not addressing every detail that UBS discussed with the EBK, the Shareholder Report provides (within the relevant Swiss data protection laws and business secrecy limitations) a comprehensive overview of the relevant developments that led to the Subprime Losses, as well as the relevant causes and contributing factors to those losses.

KPMG Ltd, Zurich, has read this Shareholder Report and the report to the EBK (consisting of a factual report, appendices and an executive summary) and determined, in their professional judgement, the Shareholder Report contains a reasonable summary of the information that UBS included in their report to the EBK. The KPMG letter is attached hereto as Appendix 1.

## 2. Overview of Losses and Key Announcements

### 2.1 Chronology

The chronology of UBS's disclosure to the market of the Subprime Losses (and other significant events / announcements) is as follows:

- On 3 May 2007, UBS announced the closure of DRCM and net negative revenue at DRCM of USD $150m$  for the first quarter 2007.  
- On 6 July 2007, UBS announced that the Board of Directors ("BoD") had appointed M Rohner as UBS's Group CEO to succeed P Wuffli, effective immediately.  
- On 3 August 2007, UBS announced the appointment of A Esteves as Global Head of Fixed Income for the Investment Bank ("IB").  
- On 14 August 2007, UBS made a profit warning in connection with its disclosure of results for the second quarter of 2007. Specifically, UBS reported that "if the current turbulent conditions prevail throughout the quarter," UBS "will probably see a very weak trading result in the Investment Bank," and "this makes it likely that profits in the second half of 2007 will be lower than in the second half of [2006]."  
- On 1 October 2007, UBS pre-announced that, after a write-down of Subprime positions, it likely would record an overall Group pre-tax loss of between CHF 600 m and CHF 800 m for the third quarter. At the same time, UBS announced a number of management changes, including that M Rohner would take over the role of IB Chairman and CEO, that H Jenkins would step down from that role, and that the Group CFO C Standish would retire (to be succeeded by M Suter, previously the Executive Vice Chairman of UBS). Additionally, J Scoby would become Group Chief Risk Officer ("Group CRO").  
- On 30 October 2007, UBS reported an operating loss of CHF 726 m for the third quarter. This reported loss was within the range provided in UBS's 1 October 2007 pre-announcement.  
- On 10 December 2007, UBS announced that it had taken additional write-downs of roughly USD 10 bn. As a result, UBS expected a loss for the fourth quarter and indicated that it might record a loss for the full year. At the same time, UBS announced measures to substantially strengthen its capital position, including a placement of mandatory convertible notes of CHF 13 bn with two strategic investors.  
- On 30 January 2008, UBS pre-announced its fourth-quarter 2007 and full-year 2007 results. UBS reported an expected loss of approximately CHF 4.4 bn for full-year 2007, a fourth quarter loss of approximately CHF 12.5 bn, and an additional USD 4 bn in write-downs in positions related to the US residential mortgage market.  
- On 14 February 2008, UBS announced fourth-quarter 2007 and full-year 2007 results in line with its 30 January 2008 announcement, with losses related to the US residential mortgage market of USD 18.7 bn. On the day before, UBS had also announced the appointment of J Johannson as Chairman and CEO of the IB and a number of additional appointments to the GEB.

Whilst outside the scope of UBS's report to the EBK (and therefore not within the scope of this Shareholder Report), UBS pre-announced its first quarter 2008 results on 1 April 2008. Based on preliminary internal estimates, UBS reported that it expects a net loss attributable to shareholders of approximately CHF 12 bn. The first quarter 2008 figures included additional write-downs of approximately USD 19 bn on US real estate and related structured credit positions. UBS further reported that its exposure to US residential Subprime mortgage related positions declined from USD 27.6 bn as at 31 December 2007 to approximately USD 15 bn as at 31 March 2008, and that the exposure to Alt-A positions declined from USD 26.6 bn as at 31 December 2007 to approximately USD 16 bn as at 31 March 2008. As described in the pre-announcement, these reductions reflect the results of asset disposals as well as the effects of further write-downs. At the same time, UBS announced a fully underwritten rights issue of approximately CHF 15 bn to strengthen Tier 1 capital and that M Ospel, Chairman of UBS, would not seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2008.

### 2.2 Business Lines Affected by the Losses

UBS had significant levels of Subprime investments in three distinct businesses:

- Within DRCM, there were Subprime positions in the Reference Linked Notes ("RLN") program, the Asset Backed Securities Relative Value ("ABS Relative Value") strategy, ABS Collateralized Debt Obligation Trading ("ABS CDO Trading") strategy and in the US Short Term Asset Backed Portfolio. The business of DRCM was pursued within UBS Global Asset Management ("Global AM"), until DRCM's re-integration into IB in the second quarter of 2007. Most of DRCM's "legacy" Subprime positions were subsequently managed by the IB's Securitized Product Group ("SPG"). More detail on these DRCM strategies is provided at section 4.1 of this Shareholder Report.  
- Within the IB, the Fixed Income business area's Rates business had Subprime positions. The Rates business had warehoused and retained Collateralized Debt Obligations ("CDOs") backed by Subprime collateral, including (in particular) Super Senior tranches of such CDOs. These Subprime positions were held principally by the CDO desk within Rates. More detail on this business is set out at section 4.2 of this Shareholder Report.  
- Also within IB the Foreign Exchange / Cash Collateral Trading ("FX/CCT") business had Subprime positions in the ABS Trading Portfolio, which was a part of the overall Relative Value Trading Portfolio ("RVT Portfolio") managed by the IB FX/CCT ABS Trading team. More detail on this business is set out at section 4.3 of this Shareholder Report.

Losses on the DRCM trading strategies contributed approximately $16\%$ of UBS's Subprime Losses for the year ended 31 December 2007. The IB's CDO desk contributed approximately $66\%$ of UBS's Subprime Losses in the same period and losses from the FX/CCT business a further $10\%$. Other parts of the IB's Fixed Income business (such as the SPG Proprietary Trading desk and the Credit Fixed Income ("CFI") business) contributed to the remainder of UBS's Subprime Losses. Given the significance of the losses suffered by the three businesses set out above, these are the focus of this Shareholder Report.

#### 3.1.1 Establishment of UBS Group Strategic Objectives

#### 3.1.2 UBS Group Strategy in 2006 and 2007

### 3.2 Dillon Read Capital Management

### 3.3 Investment Bank Fixed Income business

As a result of the agreements relating to the formation of DRCM, UBS made two senior leadership changes in the IB. In June 2005, P Wuffli, the then Group CEO recommended to the BoD that H Jenkins succeed J Costas as IB CEO and the BoD approved this appointment on 29 June 2005, effective from 1 July 2005. S Bunce was also recommended to become IB Head of Fixed Income, replacing M Hutchins.

Shortly after his appointment, H Jenkins commissioned external consultants to undertake a review of strategic initiatives for the IB. The resulting findings suggested a need to focus on a number of areas, including emerging markets, commodities, delivery of IB products to WM businesses, and streamlining of risk processes. These were presented at an IB Management Committee ("IB MC") meeting in September 2005, where it was recommended that the IB must grow significantly to avoid falling behind competition.

At the same time, the IB also undertook a specific review of the Fixed Income business in conjunction with external consultants. It was recognized in 2005 that, of all the businesses conducted by the IB, the biggest competitive gap was in Fixed Income, and that UBS's Fixed Income positioning had declined vis-à-vis leading competitors since 2002. In particular, the IB's Fixed Income, Rates & Currencies ("FIRC") revenues decreased since 2004, and accordingly, FIRC moved down in competitor league tables by revenue. According to an external consultant, the IB Fixed Income business grew its revenue at a slower rate than its peers.

The external consultant compared the gap between UBS and the composite leader (defined as top 3 in a specific product area) in various fixed income products and concluded that the

IB had gaps in the Credit, Securitized Products and Commodities businesses, with smaller gaps in Rates and Emerging Markets.

The consultant also noted that strategic and tactical initiatives were required to address these gaps and recommended that UBS selectively invest in developing certain areas of its business to close key product gaps, including in Credit, Rates, MBS Subprime and Adjustable Rate Mortgage products ("ARMs"), Commodities and Emerging Markets. ABS, MBS, and ARMs (in each case including underlying assets of Subprime nature) were specifically identified as significant revenue growth opportunities. The consultant's review did not consider the risk capacity (e.g. stress risk and market risk) associated with the recommended product expansion.

In March 2006, the IB presented its Fixed Income growth strategy to the GEB. The key growth initiatives noted in the presentation included:

- Emerging Markets - expand fixed income capability in emerging markets countries focusing on Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Mexico;  
Commodities - expand commodities business globally;  
Securitized Products - build out a new Securitized Products Group, including a Commercial Real Estate Capital Markets group and proprietary trading desk;  
- High Yield - expand Global Structured Finance and High Yield Loan Capital Markets business;  
- Structured Credit – expand investment grade structured credit and trading businesses;  
- Expand businesses and local markets presence in APAC region; and  
- Expand municipal securitization, derivatives and proprietary trading businesses.

#### 4.2.3 Super Senior Positions - Retention and Hedging

### 4.3 UBS Investment Bank: Foreign Exchange / Cash Collateral Trading

Under the arrangements described in section 5.8 of this report, IB's FX/CCT business has overall responsibility for (i) funding UBS's balance sheet, (ii) providing a central treasury function for all BGs within the UBS Group and (iii) facilitating a single point of entry into the short term wholesale cash markets. In connection with this role, FX/CCT manages UBS's daily liquidity strategy. The ABS Trading Portfolio is one part of the RVT Portfolio managed by FX/CCT within this role. The RVT Portfolio is a proprietary portfolio that historically invested in AAA-rated government and corporate bonds. The primary purpose of the RVT Portfolio (including therefore the ABS Trading Portfolio) was to act as a liquidity buffer or reserve for the UBS Group generally.

The ABS Trading Portfolio consisted of AAAand AA-rated ABS, referencing as underlying assets car leasing, credit card, commercial and residential mortgages and student loans. There was a heavy bias towards US underlying assets, reflecting a general bias in the market and also reflecting that many of these assets were pledgeable with central banks (especially the US Federal Reserve). Since establishment in late 2002 / early 2003, the ABS Trading Portfolio was of a value of between USD 25 bn and USD 30 bn. In Q3 2007 it was liquidated (as far as possible) as part of the liquidation of the RVT Portfolio more generally to create liquidity in response to the dislocation of the credit markets in August. Losses from the RVT Portfolio (primarily attributable to the ABS Trading Portfolio) in 2007 contributed approximately  $10\%$  of the total UBS losses.

UBS created the ABS Trading Portfolio in late 2002 / early 2003 after Credit Risk Control ("CRC") downgraded its country rating for Japan. This meant that FX/CCT had to reduce its then substantial holding of Japanese Government Bonds ("JGB"). Because FX/CCT retained the same level of funding liabilities and an unchanged revenue budget, it proposed to build up a portfolio of US ABS. In order for the assets to be a suitable replacement for the holdings of JGB that were to be liquidated, any replacement securities had to be:

REPO-able;  

- Highly rated – i.e. AA or AAA;  
- Capable of being pledged to (one or more of) the primary Central Banks as collateral for UBS's own borrowings; and  
- Capable of being sold in the short term.

There were also a number of other advantages of ABS perceived at the time, including small spreads, USD denomination and no interest rate dependencies (floating rate instruments only in the portfolio). Because they had a higher yield (e.g. than government bonds), including ABS in the RVT Portfolio meant that there was no negative carry trade in the RVT Portfolio.

#### 5.8.3 Development of UBS's Balance Sheet and Risk Weighted Assets

UBS regularly conducted comprehensive analyses of its balance sheet development (with detailed monthly and quarterly reporting to GEB and GRSC). Amongst other things, this reporting concerned the ongoing and continued growth in the overall balance sheet and RWA growth over time. The UBS balance sheet (total assets) grew by approximately  $17\%$  in both 2005 and 2006, and IB's share of the total balance sheet was always over  $80\%$ . That growth rate continued in the first half of 2007 and RWA grew at a commensurate rate throughout the period.

These developments were subject to Group Senior Management review and discussion. In late 2006, Group Treasury noted substantial balance sheet growth, that top quality collateral was reducing and that asset growth over the past 12 to 18 months was involving a build up in less liquid assets being funded mainly by unsecured liabilities with a lesser term. It was also noted that the high level of tradable assets included, amongst other things, the build out of the IB's ABS and MBS positions. At the time, it was suggested that imposing simple volume limits on balance sheet usage was not appropriate but it was agreed that additional analysis would be done. In this respect it should be noted that substantial Subprime Losses arose from activities that were either not reflected in the balance sheet at all or where balance sheet consumption was not significant. For example, whilst Super Senior and Negative Basis trades led to the holding of debt securities classified as trading assets carried at fair value, Super Senior VFNs were (at least initially) unfunded and required balance sheet usage only to the extent of their replacement value, which was, initially, zero.

The requested analysis was presented by Group Treasury to the GRSC in March 2007. At the time, Group Treasury discussed whether the cash capital position could turn negative and, amongst other measures, proposed a haircut funding model (with the result that liquid assets be funded by short term funding, whereas illiquid assets are funded by term money), a hard limit on IB illiquid assets and a freeze on IB's balance sheet. Whilst the haircut funding model was agreed, the proposed limits were not agreed by the then Group and IB CEOs. The Group Treasurer was asked to explore other options.

The ChO was updated on funding and liquidity issues in April 2007, at which time the ChO expressed concerns as to these issues. The then-Group CEO advised that he wanted to see how effective short term measures were before considering a general freeze in June / July. The ChO confirmed that it wished to be updated again in July / August, at which time they said it would consider illiquid asset caps in the IB.

In Q2 2007, the IB balance sheet continued to grow to a level of approximately CHF 2,500 bn (though the growth rate was slowing). At the same time, however the cash capital position deteriorated even as work continued between Group Treasury and the IB to decide how best to implement the haircut funding model that had been approved in March.

Shortly thereafter, the liquidity crisis in the wider market began. Actions taken in response resulted in:

- Imposition of hard balance sheet and RWA targets on the IB (necessitating asset reduction by the IB – with a focus on reducing illiquid assets);  
- Implementation of the already approved haircut funding model:  
- Implementation of a revised internal transfer price curve for the IB (increasing the relevant internal price for funds to the greater of UBS cost of funds and the adjusted average of a peer benchmark): and  
- The creation of a segregated liquidity buffer.

# 6. Key Findings Relating to the Causes of the Losses

### 6.1 Implementation of Agreed UBS Growth Strategy

The overriding and consistent UBS strategy in the period was that of a global firm concentrating on three global core businesses – wealth management, asset management and investment banking and securities trading – as well as retail and corporate banking in Switzerland. One of the key strategic objectives was the integrated business model with a "one firm" approach which is designed to facilitate client referrals and the exchange of products and distribution services between businesses and as a result contributed to revenue flows.

During the period under review the UBS Group pursued a growth strategy, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. Within that overarching strategy, there were a number of sub-strategies / initiatives, including:

- Build-out of the IB's Fixed Income business: The Fixed Income growth strategy was presented to the GEB in March 2006. The GEB, while generally supportive, stressed that the increase in highly structured illiquid commitments that could result from this growth plan would need to be carefully analyzed and tightly controlled and an appropriate balance between incremental revenue and VaR / Stress Loss increase would need to be achieved to avoid undue dilution of return on risk performance.
- Expansion of UBS's alternative asset management business (i.e. including the establishment of DRCM): DRCM was established in line with agreed UBS Group strategic objectives, inter alia, to create a new alternative investment management business to meet client needs. The IB PFCA and CRE businesses were identified as attractive candidates (clients had expressed a desire to co-invest in the IB PFCA strategies).

Whilst UBS's review did not identify a fundamental flaw in relation to its objectives, in hindsight UBS believes that implementation of these particular growth initiatives as well as the level of challenge by Group and IB Senior Management on these initiatives was a contributing factor to the build up of UBS's Subprime positions which subsequently incurred losses.

UBS's retrospective review focused on root causes of these losses with the view toward improving UBS's processes. This Shareholder Report will first discuss the most significant causes or contributing factors specific to the Subprime Losses incurred by the individual businesses described in the preceding sections. Finally, UBS will present the most significant causes or contributing factors to the Subprime Losses that UBS believes are structural and thus relevant to more than one business or the UBS Group overall.

# 6.2 Causes Specific to the Individual Businesses

UBS's determination of the causes discussed below (and those discussed throughout this Shareholder Report and in the information reported to the EBK) is based on its retrospective review of relevant events and has been arrived at with the benefit of hindsight.

# 6.2.1 CDO Warehouse – Causes of Loss

- Fragmented approval structure: The CDO business model involved structuring a CDO for a manager and retaining as much as  $60\%$  of the capital structure on UBS's own books. The deal size would frequently be in excess of USD 1 bn. In other parts of the IB (or elsewhere in UBS) a commitment of that size would be subject to intensive management scrutiny, either in the form of a "Commitment Committee" or other express IB Senior Management approval. Membership of most Commitment Committees would normally comprise senior control function representatives, and frequently management representatives with a strong alignment to UBS's overall franchise. In relation to the CDO business, a fragmented approval process applied, rather than a commitment committee. On several occasions, requests for TRPA and Credit Risk approval of CDS with the CDO were presented to certain of the relevant authorities only after the warehouse was ramped, i.e., the majority of assets backing and to be sold to the CDO had already been acquired. A rejection at such point in time would have entailed expensive unwinding of the CDO Warehouse and deal (and was therefore unlikely). It appears that all requests for approval were granted. Further, CDOs were not subjected to commitment scrutiny prior to the agreement with a collateral manager, as would be the case with analogous commitments elsewhere in the bank, for example in IB's Debt Capital Markets business. Although there is no indication that the existence of the warehouse was determinative of the ultimate approval to go forward with the CDOs, it is possible that earlier consideration of whether the CDOs should have been undertaken might have led to a more robust analysis of the advisability of the transaction as a whole.
- Potential structuring / trading conflict: The CDO origination team and the CDO desk that purchased the Super Senior positions that were retained on UBS's books operated within the same reporting lines. UBS believes that this could have given rise to disincentives regarding investment strategy. While this potential was discussed at the GRSC in the first quarter 2007, no action was taken as the GRSC was assured that these potential conflicts were managed by having sufficient separation and senior oversight of the business.  
- Absence of risk management: In Q2 2007, the CDO desk was giving a relatively pessimistic outlook in relation to certain aspects of the Subprime market generally in response to questions from Group and IB Senior Management about UBS's Subprime exposures. Notwithstanding this assessment, the MBS CDO business acquired further substantial Mezz RMBS holdings and the CDO desk prepared a paper to support the significant limit increase requests. The increase was ultimately not pursued.  
- Lack of operational / notional limits: Throughout 2006 and until Q3 2007, there were no aggregate notional limits on the sum of the CDO warehouse pipeline and retained CDO pipeline positions – although warehouse collateral was identified as one of the main sources of market risk in reviews of the CDO Warehouse conducted by the IB MRC function in Q4 2005 and again in Q3 2006.  
- Incomplete risk control methodologies: MRC placed considerable reliance upon VaR and Stress limits to control the risk of this business. The warehouse positions were subject to the overall Mortgage US VaR limit, and each Warehouse required approval by MRC and other control functions through the TRPA process. However, MRC did not implement additional risk methodologies or aggregate notional limits, even when losses were made

in Q1 and Q2 2007 on retained securities in the CDO Warehouse (securities or tranches left over from previous securitizations). In addition, MRC supported a change in stress methodology in April 2007, which had the effect of enabling greater volumes of securities to be warehoused within existing overall stress limits.

- Funding framework: The UBS funding framework (for further details on this see section 5.8) facilitated relatively high levels of CDO warehouse activity, as the securities in the warehouse provided positive carry (until 2007, when market conditions generated increasingly large losses).

# 6.2.2 CDO Super Senior Positions – Causes of Loss

- NegBasis Super Seniors: The NegBasis Super Senior positions were fully hedged with highly rated (generally AAA-rated) counterparties (generally monoline insurance companies). There appears to have been no breakdown in CRC's setting and monitoring of counterparty limits. The losses sustained on these positions as at 31 December 2007 were the result of the significant widening of margins to monoline exposures in anticipation of the expected severe downgrades, and the financial difficulties encountered by one particular counterparty.

# 6.2.3 AMPS and Unhedged Super Seniors

- AMPS model: The AMPS model was certified by IB Quantitative Risk Control ("QRC"), but with the benefit of hindsight appears not to have been subject to sufficiently robust stress testing. Further, the CDO desk did not carry out sufficient fundamental analysis as market conditions deteriorated, or conduct 'look-through' analysis to re-assess potential issues in the AMPS structure or the underlying CDO structure. The cost of hedging through a NegBasis trade was approximately 11 bp, whereas the cost of hedging through an AMPS trade was approximately  $5 - 6$  bp. The reasons for the differential pricing of hedging strategies that from a risk metrics perspective were deemed equivalent appears not to have been closely scrutinised at desk or other levels.  
- Funding framework: Several of the Super Senior positions (either retained from UBS CDO securitizations, or purchased from third parties) had thin positive carry of approximately 20 bp, i.e., the costs of funding the Super Senior positions were lower than the (expected) yield on these positions. More demanding internal transfer pricing requirements could have made several cash positions unattractive due to negative carry, which may have resulted in closer scrutiny of the overall carry strategy. It should be noted, however, that the unfunded Super Senior VFN positions would not have been constrained in the same way by more onerous funding requirements, as they required no initial funding, and only their mark-to-market (not nominal) values showed on the balance sheet (in RWA figures).  
- Lack of monitoring / visibility: Once hedged, either through NegBasis or AMPS trades, the Super Senior positions were VaR and Stress Testing neutral (i.e., because they were treated as fully hedged, the Super Senior positions were netted to zero and therefore did not utilize VaR and Stress limits). The CDO desk considered a Super Senior hedged with  $2\%$  or more of AMPS protection to be fully hedged. In several MRC reports, the long and short positions were netted, and the inventory of Super Seniors was not shown, or was unclear. For AMPS trades, the zero VaR assumption subsequently proved to be incorrect as only a portion of the exposure was hedged as described in section 4.2.3, although it was believed at the time that such protection was sufficient. A

consequence of this treatment was a lack of visibility to, and challenge of these positions by, Group and IB Senior Management.

- Lack of notional limits until Q3 2007: NegBasis trades were subject to notional limits, and underlying CDO trades were approved through the TRPA process. However, MRC did not set a notional limit for AMPS Super Seniors, or for the overall holdings of Super Seniors until Q3 2007.  
- Absence of specific approval process for unhedged positions: Other than the general TRPA process for CDOs, there was no approval process or particular restriction on retaining or purchasing unhedged Super Senior positions (including unhedged positions acquired in anticipation of execution of AMPS hedges). The CDO desk did not submit an NBI request for the AMPS business, although in total eleven AMPS trades were executed.  
- Incomplete capture of risk attributes by risk control: The risk reports for this business reported notionals (but after netting) and credit deltas. The presentation of the risk on a credit delta basis overlooked the fact that there was only  $2 - 4\%$  (sometimes more) protection on Mezzanine RMBS. MRC did not seek to expand the monitoring framework to capture other dimensions of the risk, such as gamma (i.e., the absolute change in the delta of an option when the price of the underlying asset moves).

# 6.2.4 Dillon Read Capital Management

The principal causes of loss in the respective DRCM trading strategies are identified below.

- RLN – Failure to mitigate fully the impact of a tail event: The RLN losses arose in the context of unprecedented liquidity conditions seen in August 2007. At circa  $7\%$  of the notional value of the global RLN program, which had been profitable since its launch in 1999, these losses are probably most appropriately viewed as the program experiencing a tail event.  
- ABS / MBS Relative Value Trading losses: Insufficient accounting for the risk of divergent movements between previously correlated asset classes or instruments ("basis risk"): From Q2 2006, the relevant desk began purchasing ABS tranches with underlying  $2^{\text{nd}}$  lien mortgages of higher credit quality. While this was in response to increased credit concerns over Subprime ABS securities, write-downs were required in Q1 2007, and rose ultimately to USD 430 m (prior to transfer to IB). While DRCM's home equity linked trading book had been net short in Subprime exposure since September 2006, short positions in CDS on single ABS, spreadlocks and the ABX were investment grade as opposed to the substantial portion of below investment grade long positions.
- Insufficient attention to idiosyncratic risk factors (i.e., the risk of price change due to unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market): UBS believes that the ABS / MBS relative value trading losses arose from insufficient attention being paid to fundamental risk factors specific to the Subprime sector within DRCM's home equity-linked trading book (idiosyncratic risks – such as vintage,  $1^{\text{st}}$  /  $2^{\text{nd}}$  lien, etc.), and to basis risk errors made in hedging those positions. Risk management, risk control and valuation systems and data appear to have been lacking.  
- ABS CDO Trading losses: The losses on this program were, in the context of the market dislocation, relatively limited.  
US Short Term Asset Backed Portfolio losses – Funding model and over-reliance on AAA ratings: The UBS funding model allowed carry trades to evolve using excess cheap liquidity. Losses are attributed mainly to over-reliance on the AAA rating of the portfolio securities that in retrospect did not perform in line with the rating.

# 6.2.5 FX/CCT ABS Trading Portfolio

- Lack of reaction to changing market: The various parties involved with the portfolio were aware of the content of the portfolio and the deterioration in the Subprime markets generally. However, those persons seem to have believed that there would not be an impact on the highly rated ABS in the portfolio. In addition, it seems that further comfort was taken from the continued acceptance of the respective assets as eligible collateral with the relevant Central Banks and the short term nature of the assets. Also, liquidity was generally assumed, even though trading activity in the ABS Trading Portfolio was relatively low.  
- UBS's overall funding framework and approach to liquidity management: IB FX/CCT is a profit centre within IB – but was tasked to manage the Group's liquidity reserve. The IB preferred to have a positive carry trade in the portfolio. This was arguably an influencing factor in the decision to replace JGBs with ABS in 2002. There was no decision to forego some level of profit to ensure that the Group's liquidity reserve was fully capable of liquidation in any event and at any time. Rather there seems to have been an historic assumption that the portfolio would fulfil its need if and when required. Additionally, Group Treasury's direct involvement in the ABS Trading (or RVT Portfolio more generally) on a day to day basis seems to have been limited historically due to the long-standing delegation to IB FX/CCT of management of UBS's daily liquidity strategy.  
- Incomplete risk control methodologies: There was considerable reliance on AA/AAA ratings and sector and concentration limits which did not take into account the fact that more than  $95\%$  of the ABS Trading Portfolio was referencing US underlying assets (i.e., mortgage loans, auto loans, credit card debts etc.).  
- Lack of granular data: Neither risk management nor the control functions had readily accessible data upon which to perform fundamental analysis of the securities in the portfolio, for example vintage,  $1^{st}$  or  $2^{nd}$  lien or FICO score.

# 6.3 Overarching Causes

These overarching causes, like the causes discussed above and throughout this Shareholder Report and in the information reported to the EBK are based on UBS's retrospective review of relevant events and have been arrived at with the benefit of hindsight.

# 6.3.1 DRCM

DRCM accounted for approximately  $16\%$  of the Subprime Losses as at 31 December 2007. The broader relevance of DRCM to this Shareholder Report is as follows:

- Loss of senior Fixed Income risk management expertise in the IB: The creation of DRCM had a significant impact on the IB businesses and leadership, in particular as applied to Fixed Income. At the IB, there was a change in CEO and in Fixed Income leadership, and two key IB businesses (PFCA and CRE) were, from the IB's perspective, lost in the sense that considerable talents had moved from the IB to DRCM and were no longer available for the IB's own growth initiatives in that business field. The leadership changes also had an impact on the level of risk management expertise available at the IB, in particular as the IB's new leadership's acknowledged expertise was in sales and not trading (especially Fixed Income trading).  
- Insufficient challenge of the business case and governance approach: The manner in which DRCM was established did not correctly weigh the strength of UBS as an organisation against the perceived importance, interests and demands of a few individuals, and allowed exceptional levels of autonomy within a complex and non-standard governance model.  
- Distraction for Senior Management: Both the formation and dissolution of DRCM were highly destructive for Senior Management. This arose in two key ways. Firstly, DRCM's formation required the focus of IB Senior Management and therefore reduced their ability to attend to the ambitious growth plans of Fixed Income. Secondly, DRCM's dissolution absorbed considerable time of both Group and IB Senior Management at a critical point in the deterioration of the Subprime sector.  
- Added growth pressure for IB Fixed Income: DRCM was not viewed as an outsourcing of IB's Fixed Income capability. Rather, the IB intended to grow its own Fixed Income business, notwithstanding the loss of PFCA, a major component in the creation of DRCM. This in turn added to the pressure to grow IB Fixed Income.  
- DRCM's use of the IB's control framework and infrastructure platform: IB operational and logistics support and control oversight functions had to cover both the retained (and growing) IB Fixed Income business as well as the DRCM business (which was essentially a new business venture being built from scratch). Additionally, the ongoing discussions around establishment and implementation of the DRCM business and the complex issues it raised (e.g. a separate risk framework for the OIF and CFC) required substantial attention from members of IB, Global AM and Group Senior Management on an ongoing basis. Implementation of DRCM demanded substantially more resource commitment at all levels than was initially expected. These burdens played a role in reducing the ability of the control and logistics functions to investigate and respond to the exposures in the IB.  
- Lack of full capitalization on the DRCM loss experience: It appears that although the DRCM losses were often in asset classes that were rated lower than Subprime positions in the IB, the closure of DRCM could have been a basis for a more comprehensive review and assessment of all Subprime positions in the IB, and for a review of UBS's risk assessment processes in connection with the same. While reviews for similar exposures within IB were initiated as a result of the DRCM losses, those reviews did not succeed in

identifying the latent issues within, among other positions, the IB's substantial portfolio of retained CDO Super Senior tranches.

# 6.3.2 Fixed Income

- Growth orientation: The IB was focused on the maximization of revenue. There appears to have been a lack of challenge on the risk and reward to business area plans within the IB at a senior level. UBS's review suggests an asymmetric focus in IB Senior Management meetings on revenue and P&L, especially when compared to discussions of risk issues. Business-peer challenge was not a routine practice in those meetings.  
- Lack of challenge within the IB to IB Fixed Income strategy: The review benchmarking UBS with peers that had been commissioned from an outside consultant, and the subsequent development and presentation of an ambitious Fixed Income growth strategy to the IB Management Committee and the GEB, were intent on closing perceived gaps to competitors, but apparently were not sufficiently challenged internally. In particular it seemed to be assumed that there were no infrastructure constraints that might affect implementation, that requisite skills existed or could be hired, or that there was no balance sheet utilization limit or other natural market barriers.  
- Lack of recognition for required growth in supporting resources: There does not appear to have been investment in the type of control resources and infrastructure commensurate with the significant increases in volumes, revenues, and complexity of the Fixed Income strategic objectives. The systems infrastructure was not capable of capturing the complexities associated with some of the more complex Fixed Income products.  
- Limited substantive off-cycle strategic re-assessment within the IB: Notwithstanding quarterly meetings held by IB Management, there does not appear to have taken place a significant (re)assessment (or resulting change) in IB strategy outside the routine annual process over the relevant period. This seems to contrast with peer investment banks who conducted reviews more frequently.  
- Inappropriate risk metrics used in strategic planning and assessment: IB business planning relied on VaR, which appears as the key risk parameter in the planning process. When the market dislocation unfolded, it became apparent that this risk measure methodology had not appropriately captured the risk inherent in the businesses having Subprime exposures.  
- Lack of hard limits on RWA / balance sheet usage: Coupled with the funding framework, this meant the IB was not incentivised in an appropriate way to assess and prioritise between businesses from a resource allocation perspective when setting strategy.

The discussion above focuses on IB. However, these points also reflect or raise questions about the wider strategy setting process for UBS Group as a whole.

# 6.3.3 Governance

UBS believes that the overall design of the UBS governance framework is appropriate and with clear allocation of responsibilities. As with the questions on strategy noted above, our

review of the minutes of the relevant committees on the BoD, GEB and IB level lead us to the conclusion that the overriding issues relate principally to implementation and effectiveness.

# 6.3.3.1 Group Governance

In September 2006, Group Senior Management expressed general concerns about the US housing market within the GRSC. Further, from the time the first losses in DRCM became apparent in Q1 2007, the GRSC was alert to the issues associated with Subprime investments generally and keen to understand UBS's exposure to these markets. However, IB Senior Management only appreciated the severity of the problem in late July 2007. Consequently, only on 6 August 2007, when the relevant IB management made a presentation to the ChO, were the ChO and the CEO of UBS given a comprehensive picture of the exposures of UBS relating to their CDO Super Senior positions. UBS has identified a number of factors that appear to have detracted from the effectiveness of Group Senior Management's response to the Subprime situation.

- Failure to demand a holistic risk assessment: Whilst the Group Senior Management was alert to general issues concerning the deteriorating US housing market, they did not demand a holistic presentation of UBS's exposure to securities referencing US real estate assets before July 2007, even though such an assessment may have been warranted earlier in view of the size of UBS's real estate assets. Whilst attempts were made to understand the risks in the Subprime segment before that time, Risk Control and business management described substantial notional exposures in AAA-rated securities, limited exposures to lower rated instruments and low Stress Loss on the portfolio. Similarly, IB Senior Management assured Group Senior Management that the risks in the IB were well managed. It appears that the IB management did at no stage conduct a robust independent assessment of its overall Subprime exposures. Consequently, Group Senior Management relied on assurances of others rather than obtaining all of the facts and analytically reviewing the situation.
- Failure to manage the agenda: Prior to Q3 2007, discussions in relation to Subprime exposures were frequently one item in what were often extensive agendas of Group management committees. The review of these exposures was in contrast with the attention that Group Senior Management gave, for instance, to leveraged finance transactions which were subject to extensive debate and challenge with clear direction in relation to the Group's overall risk appetite. When the potential Subprime related issues were being discussed, on the other hand, the presentations made to Group Senior Management did not generate sufficiently well defined actions with hard deadlines and follow up.
- Lack of succession planning: On establishment of DRCM, leadership succession at the IB was identified on a reactive basis, rather than as a part of a wider and long standing succession planning arrangement.

# 6.3.3.2 Investment Bank Governance

The IB had many committees that had the mandate to review and discuss issues relevant to the businesses with exposure to the Subprime market. The overriding IB governance issue seems principally to be one of lack of effectiveness of these key committees. UBS believes that the most important factors that contributed to this are:

- Failure to demand a holistic risk assessment: It appears that the focus of the IB was revenue growth and filling the gap to competitors. This contrasts with the level of debate at the same time within relevant Group governance committees such as the GRSC.  
- Failure to own the business: Members of the IB Senior Management apparently did not sufficiently challenge each other in relation to the development of their various businesses. The Fixed Income strategy does not appear to have been subject to critical challenge, for instance in view of the substantial investments in systems, people and financial resources that the growth plans entailed.

# 6.3.4 Funding Framework and Balance Sheet / RWA Management and Control

In retrospect, it appears that the UBS funding framework and related approach to balance sheet management were significant contributors to the creation of UBS's Subprime exposure generally for the following reasons:

# 6.3.4.1 Funding Framework

- Low cost of funding: Given the internal funding rates in the UBS Funds Pricing Policy as it existed at the relevant times, UBS's businesses generally were able to fund themselves internally at prices that were better than those available in the market.  
- Lack of differentiation between liquid and illiquid assets / term funding: The internal funding framework as it operated pursuant to the Funds Pricing Policy did not create sufficient incentives for the businesses to match funding or to distinguish liquid and illiquid assets. Effectively, the full benefit of UBS's ability to obtain funding at a relatively low cost in the market was passed through to the business, without any adjustment to reflect the nature of the relevant business activity.  
- Limited business sensitivity to funding issues: Coupled with the lack of hard limits on Balance Sheet usage / RWA, it appears that the funding framework created an environment in which significant levels of funding were available to the business generally. The Funds Pricing Policy made trades more profitable than they would otherwise have been as even investments in instruments generating small yields still were profitable. This incentivised carry trades generally across the IB.  
- Resistance to change the funding framework: Whilst there was discussion in 2005 and the first half of 2006 on controls about the nature and tenor of funding for DRCM, no similar approach was considered for application to the IB (or more widely) until late 2006 / early 2007 when discussions at the Group Senior Management level culminated in the (in principle) approval of a haircut funding model by the GRSC in March 2007 and approval of a revised internal transfer price curve (implemented in November 2007).

A number of IB businesses (including those generating Subprime Losses) grew in 2006 by creating portfolios with relatively low returns on assets. In hindsight, UBS believes that the implementation of a more stringent funding model for the IB could have resulted in different investment decisions by the IB. However, such a funding model was seen by IB Senior Management as potentially impacting their growth plans.

# 6.3.4.2 Balance Sheet / RWA Management and Control – Findings

- Lack of principles on Balance Sheet / RWA management and control: Whilst there is a long-established policy framework around treasury, funding and liquidity related matters, which complemented UBS's wider governance framework, there has not historically been an equally clearly articulated statement of UBS's key principles for balance sheet and RWA management and control.  
- Ex-post review versus pre-agreed limits: There was regular, frequent and detailed reporting on balance sheet and other related developments, however, this was after the event. A proposal in early 2007 from Group Treasury to impose hard limits on IB balance sheet usage and illiquid asset positions to halt further growth was not agreed by the then Group and IB CEOs.  
- Resistance to hard limits: The balance sheet size was not considered a limiting metric. Whilst there was regular reporting by Group Treasury on balance sheet development, there was no formal Asset & Liability Committee ("ALCO") to take decisions on balance sheet allocation until establishment of the IB ALCO in January 2007. This issue became more pronounced when liquidity deteriorated. In Q3 and Q4 2007, hard balance sheet limits and RWA targets for the IB were agreed and fixed (including for 2008). However such top down setting of hard limits did not take place previously.  
- Business prioritisation: It appears that within IB the emphasis was on delivering growth, with the size of the balance sheet a second order issue. There was some communication within IB Senior Management to limit balance sheet growth, and also some concern expressed at Group level. However, there was continued growth in the IB balance sheet and RWA in Q1 and Q2 2007.

# 6.3.5 Risk Management

UBS has identified the following contributory causes in relation to risk management by the relevant businesses generally, including:

- Gaps in risk management expertise / experience at the IB Senior Business Management level: The successors of the departing top managers in IB appointed in July 2005 had strong sales and client attributes, but it appears that neither had strong risk management backgrounds. A senior risk manager in Fixed Income was not hired, even though this had been planned in 2006.  
- Failure to respond to wider industry concerns: At the level of relevant business management, there appears not to have been sufficient discussion of or actions upon concerns surrounding Subprime as an asset class until Q3 2007, even though UBS's research team issued research reports on this area. This seems to have arisen largely from the belief that deterioration in the Subprime market would not impact AAA assets. For example, in March 2007, the Rates business gave a relatively pessimistic assessment of certain aspects of the Subprime market to Group Senior Management. However, over this period, CDO Warehouse activity continued and the CDO desk proposed increases in limits.  
- Absence of Front-desk limit structure: Relevant IB business management do not appear to have imposed a framework of additional limits on the business under review beyond those set by risk control functions. Whilst it is noted that a threshold limit was imposed

on Negative Basis trades, and that the NBIs for Negative Basis and Super Senior VFN entailed notional limits, the limits that bounded this business' activities appear to have largely been confined to those set by MRC or the requirement for transaction approval through TRPA. There is no indication that IB Senior Management seriously challenged the efficacy of pursuing this business in the face of increasing concern about the US housing market and specifically the Subprime sector.

- Lack of fundamental analysis, or to "look through" structures: In several of the relevant businesses, the CDO desk did not conduct significant fundamental analysis of underlying Subprime until Q3 2007.

# 6.3.6 Risk Control

The vast majority of positions that caused the Subprime Losses were monitored under and subject to the limit structure of the Market Risk framework. The exception was the MOSG business, which was part of DRCM. That business was subject to the Credit Risk framework. Apart from that, CRC's participation in the businesses exposed to the Subprime market was limited to the approval of transactions. CRC was one of the participants in the TRPA process and approved the long tenor CDS as part of the CDO business. CRC also monitored exposures to monoline insurers.

Managing risk is first and foremost the responsibility of the business. Consequently, many of the points that follow apply equally to the business. UBS's analysis identified a number of factors within the Risk Control functions, specifically within Market Risk, that suggest that the overall Risk Control framework was insufficiently robust. Those factors are outlined below.

# 6.3.6.1 Measurement and Monitoring Tools:

- Time series reliance: The historical time series used to drive VaR and Stress are based on five years of data, whereby the data was sourced from a period of relatively positive growth. Regular work being performed during the relevant period focused on confirming the efficacy of existing scenarios based on broad based economic developments and historical events. When updates to methodologies were presented to Group and IB Senior Management, hindsight suggests that these updates did not attribute adequate weight to the significant growth in the US housing market and especially the Subprime market. The Market Risk function did not develop scenarios that were based on more fundamental attributes of the US housing market.  
- Lack of Housing Market Risk Factor Loss limits: In a similar vein, it appears that no attempt was made to develop an RFL structure that captured more meaningful attributes related to the US housing market generally, such as defaults, loan to value ratios or other similar attributes to statistically shock the existing portfolio.  
- Over-reliance on VaR and Stress: MRC relied on VaR and Stress numbers, even though delinquency rates were increasing and origination standards were falling in the US mortgage market. It continued to do so throughout the build-up of significant positions in Subprime assets that were only partially hedged. Presentations of MRC representatives to UBS's senior governance bodies did not provide adequate granularity of Subprime positions UBS held in its various businesses. No warnings were given to Group Senior Management about the limitations of the presented numbers or the need

to look at the broader contextual framework and the findings were not challenged with perseverance.

- Over-reliance on ratings: MRC relied on the AAA rating of certain Subprime positions, although the CDOs were built from lower rated tranches of RMBS. This appears to have been common across the industry. There is no indication that MRC sought to review the quality of existing portfolios as questions were being raised in relation to the Subprime sector more generally. A comprehensive analysis of the portfolios may have indicated that the positions would not necessarily perform consistent with their ratings.  
- Lack of recognition of idiosyncratic risk: Whilst an analytical review conducted by GIA identified certain risks in the Subprime trading books, senior risk control did not appear to take those issues into account when concluding that positions were hedged.  
- Lack of comprehensive Subprime risk assessment: Senior risk control did not seek to undertake a comprehensive risk assessment of UBS's Subprime exposure, including understanding gross notional and hedge coverage. Efforts were made to capture the Subprime holdings by mid-February 2007, however materials did not effectively include the Super Senior and Negative Basis positions.

# 6.3.6.2 Limit Framework

- Lack of comprehensive limit framework: VaR and Stress were intended as portfolio risk measures and monitoring tools. These were to be supplemented with Risk Factor and Operational Limits. MRC did not develop a comprehensive limit framework to ensure that the Subprime portfolio would be contained within limits that matched Group Senior Management's concern about exposures in this asset class.  
- Lack of response / speed of reaction: Although the limitations of VaR and Stress Loss were known, MRC do not appear to have prioritised closing gaps in the existing framework.

# 6.3.6.3 Reporting

- Complex and incomplete risk reporting: Market and Credit Risk developed a significant reporting suite. In the Market Risk area the reporting seems to be intensive. A number of attempts were made to present Subprime or housing related exposures. The reports did not, however, communicate an effective message for a number of reasons, in particular because the reports were overly complex, presented outdated data or were not made available to the right audience. The extensive catalogue of risk reports runs against a simple presentation of the risks that needed to be managed and identification of the actions that needed to be taken. Risks were siloed within the risk functions, without presenting a holistic picture of the risk situation of a particular business.  
- Lack of substantive assessment: MRC did not routinely put numbers into the broader economic context or the fundamentals of the market when presenting to Senior Management.

# 6.3.6.4 Healthy Scepticism

- Independence: Fundamental analysis of the Subprime market seems to have been generally based on the business' view and less on MRC's independent assessment. In

particular, there is no indication that MRC was seeking views from other sources than business. MRC provided support to the business that requested to receive more favourable treatment in relation to the application of the Stress Loss methodology to the CDO warehouse. While this may have been an opportunity to rethink the rationale for the business model as a whole, MRC accepted these proposals from the business and thus enabled it to grow further. Further, risk systems and infrastructure were not improved because of a willingness by the risk function to support growth.

- Lack of challenge to business: MRC appears not to have substantively challenged the CDO desk when significant limit increases for the RMBS warehouse were requested initially in late 2006, and then again in Q2 2007, when the Subprime CDO business was undergoing significant growth.  
- Assumed liquidity: The Super Senior notes were always treated as trading book (i.e., the book for assets intended for resale in the short term), notwithstanding the fact that there does not appear to have been a liquid secondary market and that the business tended to retain the Super Senior tranche. This is supported by MRC's own analysis according to which reliance was placed on a home equity time series created from new issue rather than secondary market data. The liquidity assumption by MRC and Finance was based on new issues in a rapidly expanding market. Treatment under the "banking book" would have significantly changed the economics of the CDO desk business as this would have increased the required regulatory capital charges. Further, liquidity risk associated with having concentrated positions in an asset class (albeit AAA rated) does not appear to have been actively challenged.

# 6.3.6.5 Testing the Business Model

- Lack of holistic assessment: It does not appear that MRC thoroughly investigated the CDO business model. In particular, given the state of the Subprime market at that time, the CDO desk's request for limit increases in Q2 2007 to further support growth of the CDO business (which was ultimately not approved) might have given rise to a more fundamental re-evaluation of risks inherent in the CDO business.

# 6.3.6.6 Infrastructure Investment

- Inadequate systems: The existing risk management, finance and risk control systems were not sufficiently robust with respect to risk monitoring in relation to complex products. This led to an inability to obtain a portfolio view in certain products. These infrastructure issues had been raised but no substantial actions appear to have been taken to address concerns. Infrastructure limitations became even more problematic with the business growth into more complex, higher margin products.

# 6.3.6.7 Silos

- Lack of strategic coordination: The risk functions (Market, Credit and Finance) operate as independent units, brought together to assess individual transactions. It does not appear that these functions sought systematically to operate in a strategically connected manner.

# 6.3.6.8 NBI/TRPA Processes

- Shortcomings in approach: There was no NBI process for the CDO structuring business or for the AMPS business. AMPS trades were subject to repeated TRPA approvals – with the effect that whilst trade-by-trade approvals were obtained, substantively the depth and breadth of assessment was probably not at the same level that would have been applied if an NBI case had been submitted. Additionally, TRPAs for CDOs appear often to have been presented to the control functions for approval only at a relatively late stage, when the majority of the assets backing and to be transferred to the CDO special purpose vehicle had already been warehoused and the consequences of declining the proposal would have entailed costly unwinding of the warehouse.
- Focus on speed: The NBI and TRPA processes were also seen by some IB business areas, including Fixed Income, as bureaucratic and slow. The IB's NBI and TRPA processes were subject to a number of reviews and recommendations for improvement, over a period of several months – but the emphasis was generally on speeding up approvals as opposed to ensuring that the process achieved the goal of delivering substantive and holistic risk assessment of the proposals presented.

### 6.3.7 Finance Oversight

The basis of accounting for, and the valuations applied to, securities and synthetic positions was significant to the economic performance of the businesses with Subprime exposure and to the financial incentives for the staff involved in these businesses. In particular it was important to the timing and levels of profit recorded by the ABS / MBS and CDO desks in the Rates area that their strategies (for example the AMPS trades) were eligible for Day 1 P&L treatment. BUC operated as an independent control unit in confirming the determinations made by the ABS / MBS and CDO desks. UBS considered the approach to valuations and reporting taken by BUC in relation to the positions over the period and identified the following as a factor in UBS's lack of an effective response to the market dislocation:

- Inability to accurately assess valuation risk on a timely basis: A number of key indicators in relation to valuation issues over structured Fixed Income products were identified and reported in the period prior to Q3 2007. These included a reduced ability to source external prices to verify trader marks and general increases in the value of untested positions. Due to limitations in data, BUC were not in a position to challenge on a timely basis the assertion for valuation purposes of the flat or low risk nature of the retained Super Senior positions. BUC reported (as have other independent internal control units) that there were examples where significant manual intervention and reconciliation was required to assess the relevant risk nature, or where data was fragmented or insufficiently granular. These conditions existed for some time and represented latent and significant risks that were not reported by BUC as being of the highest priority until Q3 2007, after the impact of the Subprime crisis had become apparent.

### 6.3.8 Compensation

UBS has identified the following contributory factors related to compensation and incentives:

- Structural incentives to implement carry trades: The UBS compensation and incentivisation structure did not effectively differentiate between the creation of alpha

(i.e., return in excess of a defined expectation) versus the creation of return based on a low cost of funding. In other words, employee incentivisation arrangements did not differentiate between return generated by skill in creating additional returns versus returns made from exploiting UBS's comparatively low cost of funding in what were essentially carry trades. There are no findings that special arrangements were made for employees in the businesses holding Subprime positions. However, the relatively high yield attributable to Subprime made this asset class an attractive long position for carry trades. Further, the UBS funding framework amplified the incentives to pursue compensation through profitable carry trades. For example, several Super Senior trades had relatively thin overall positive carry.

- Asymmetric risk / reward compensation: The compensation structure generally made little recognition of risk issues or adjustment for risk / other qualitative indicators (e.g. for Group Internal Audit ratings, operational risk indicators, compliance issues, etc.). For example, there were incentives for the CDO structuring desk to pursue concentrations in Mezzanine CDOs, which had a significantly higher fee structure (approximately 125-150 bp) than High-Grade CDOs (approximately 30-50 bp). Similarly, the CDO desk had an incentive to pursue AMPS trades, as they provided, compared to NegBasis trades, a less expensive (and therefore higher return) form of hedging. Also, Day1 P&L treatment of many of the transactions meant that employee remuneration (including bonuses) was not directly impacted by the longer term development of positions created. The reluctance to allow variations between financial reporting and management accounting made it less likely that options to vary the revenue attributed to traders for compensation purposes would be considered.  
- Insufficient incentives to protect the UBS franchise long-term: Under UBS's principles for compensation, deferred equity forms a component of compensation that generally increases with seniority. Although incentivisation of employees broadly builds in increasing levels of deferred equity for increasingly senior people, it remains the case that bonus payments for successful and senior IB Fixed Income traders, including those in the businesses holding Subprime positions were significant. Essentially, bonuses were measured against gross revenue after personnel costs, with no formal account taken of the quality or sustainability of those earnings.

Appendix 2: List of Abbreviations and Glossary  

<table><tr><td>ABS</td><td>Asset backed security; a debt security the value of which is derived from a pool of assets, or that is collateralized by the cash flows from a pool of assets. An ABS may be backed by loans, leases or other receivables. A security backed by mortgages (commercial or residential) is known as a Mortgage Backed Security or MBS.</td></tr><tr><td>ABS Relative Value</td><td>DRCM's Asset Backed Securities Relative Value trading strategy</td></tr><tr><td>ABS CDO Trading</td><td>DRCM's ABS Collateralized Debt Obligation trading strategy</td></tr><tr><td>ABX</td><td>The ABS Home Equity Synthetic Index (ABX. HE) as calculated by Marklt</td></tr><tr><td>AC</td><td>Audit Committee</td></tr><tr><td>Alt-A</td><td>Alt-A loans are considered less risky than Subprime mortgages, but usually have lower credit quality than "prime" loans. Alt-A loans were originally designed for borrowers with clean credit records, but with other issues that often meant they provided fewer documents or even no documents showing what they earned. These loans were attractive to investors in mortgage-backed securities because they offered higher yields than traditional "prime" home loans, but were underpinned by the cleaner credit records of the borrowers.</td></tr><tr><td>AMPS</td><td>AMPS (abbreviation for Amplified Mortgage Portfolio trades) provide a platform for hedging the credit spread exposure from UBS holdings in long synthetic and cash assets. Typical trades would be that UBS buys protection on a specified percentage of market value losses in a specified reference pool of ABS assets (CMBS, CDO, CLO) or to buy protection between two predetermined levels. Structurally, AMPS are a synthetic ABS portfolio trade where investors take a leveraged exposure to a diversified pool of ABS. Investors take either the first market value loss on this pool or market losses between two predetermined levels. In return they receive a coupon of LIBOR + spread, where the spread depends on the quality of the underlying portfolio and level of market loss protection.</td></tr><tr><td>APAC</td><td>Asia Pacific region</td></tr><tr><td>ARMs</td><td>Adjustable rate mortgage products</td></tr><tr><td>Basis Risk</td><td>Basis risk is the risk associated with hedging one position with an opposite position using instruments that are not perfectly correlated. For example, on the basis of past statistical information the prices of two instruments may be expected to move broadly in line with each other and they may therefore be considered to provide a hedge for each other. Any divergence in price movements between the two – including day to day divergences from the average – will result in gains or losses.</td></tr><tr><td>BG</td><td>Business Group(s)</td></tr><tr><td>bn</td><td>Billion(s)</td></tr><tr><td>BoD or Board</td><td>The board of directors of UBS, as comprised at the relevant time.</td></tr><tr><td>bp</td><td>Basis point(s) – one hundredth of a percent</td></tr><tr><td>BUC</td><td>Business Unit Control, part of the IB Finance function</td></tr><tr><td>CDO</td><td>Collateralized debt obligation; a structured credit product which is a more complex form of Asset Backed Security (ABS). CDOs are backed by a portfolio of fixed-income assets. e.g. a pool of bonds, loans and other assets, but not all assets are necessarily of the same type (which distinguishes CDOs from other types of ABS). CDOs are structured to offer investors different degrees of risk and correspondingly different levels of income depending on which tranche they invest in. These tranches carry different credit ratings and are grouped into: senior tranches (rated AAA, AA), mezzanine tranches (A to BB), and equity tranches (unrated).</td></tr><tr><td>CDS</td><td>Credit default swap</td></tr><tr><td>CEO</td><td>Chief Executive Officer</td></tr><tr><td>CFC</td><td>The DRCM Controlled Finance Companies</td></tr><tr><td>CFI</td><td>Credit Fixed Income</td></tr><tr><td>CHF</td><td>Swiss Franc(s)</td></tr><tr><td>ChO</td><td>Chairman's Office</td></tr><tr><td>CMBS</td><td>Commercial Mortgage Backed Security</td></tr><tr><td>CMO</td><td>Collateralized Mortgage Obligation</td></tr><tr><td>CRC</td><td>Credit Risk Control</td></tr><tr><td>CRE</td><td>Commercial Real Estate</td></tr><tr><td>DRCM</td><td>Dillon Read Capital Management</td></tr><tr><td>EaR</td><td>Earnings-at-Risk; EaR is an assessment of the potential loss inherent in our business in the current economic cycle, across all business lines, and from all sources, including primary risks, operational risks and business risks. It is measured against a severe, low probability, but nevertheless plausible constellation of events over a one year time horizon.</td></tr><tr><td>E&amp;Y</td><td>Ernst &amp; Young AG, UBS's external auditors</td></tr><tr><td>EBK</td><td>The Eidgenössische Bankenkommission or Swiss Federal Banking Commission</td></tr><tr><td>EWM</td><td>GWM&amp;BB's European Wealth Management business</td></tr><tr><td>FICC</td><td>The IB's Fixed Income Currencies and Commodities business</td></tr><tr><td>FICO</td><td>A FICO score is a credit score developed by Fair Isaac &amp; Co. Credit scoring is a method of determining the likelihood that credit users will pay their bills.</td></tr><tr><td>FIRC</td><td>The IB Fixed Income, Rates and Currencies business</td></tr><tr><td>FX/CCT</td><td>The IB's Foreign Exchange / Cash Collateral Trading business, now referred to as the IB's Money Markets,</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Currencies and Commodities business ("MCC"), which is in turn part of the IB's Fixed Income Currencies and Commodities ("FICC") business.</td></tr><tr><td>GEB</td><td>The Group Executive Board of UBS, as comprised at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>GHMR</td><td>Group Head of Market Risk</td></tr><tr><td>GIA</td><td>Group Internal Audit</td></tr><tr><td>Global AM</td><td>UBS Global Asset Management, a business group of UBS</td></tr><tr><td>GRSC</td><td>The GEB Risk Sub-Committee, as comprised at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>Group CCO</td><td>The Group Chief Credit Officer at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>Group CFO</td><td>The Group Chief Financial Officer at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>Group CRO</td><td>The Group Chief Risk Officer at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>Group Senior Management</td><td>The members of the GEB and GRSC, at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>GWM&amp;BB</td><td>UBS Global Wealth Management &amp; Business Banking, a business group of UBS</td></tr><tr><td>Hedge</td><td>A position taken to offset potential changes in value of another position. The effectiveness of a hedge depends on the correlation between the factors from which the values of the two positions are derived – the greater the correlation, the more effective the hedge and the less basis risk is introduced. For example, an exposure to an auto manufacturer might be hedged by buying credit protection on that manufacturer (low basis risk) or on another auto manufacturer (higher basis risk), or on a manufacturer in a different sector (potentially high basis risk).</td></tr><tr><td>IB</td><td>UBS Investment Bank, a business group of UBS</td></tr><tr><td>IB ALCO</td><td>The IB Asset &amp; Liability Committee</td></tr><tr><td>IB CRO</td><td>The IB Chief Risk Officer at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>IB MC</td><td>The IB Management Committee (superseded by the IB Executive Committee ("IB EC") in Q3 2007)</td></tr><tr><td>IB R&amp;GC</td><td>The IB Risk &amp; Governance Committee</td></tr><tr><td>IB Senior Management</td><td>The members of the IB MC and IB EC, at the relevant time</td></tr><tr><td>ISDA</td><td>International Swap and Derivatives Association</td></tr><tr><td>JGB</td><td>Japanese Government Bonds</td></tr><tr><td>KPMG</td><td>KPMG Ltd, Zurich</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>Level 2 Assets are valued based on a valuation technique, which uses market observable inputs, where</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>available, derived from similar assets in similar and active markets, from recent transaction prices for comparable items or from other observable market data.</td></tr><tr><td>Level 3 Assets</td><td>Level 3 Assets are valued based on modeled / non-observable inputs, not corroborated by market data.</td></tr><tr><td>Limit</td><td>A quantitative control on the amount of exposure that risk managers can take. The limit can be expressed as a volume (total nominal or market value), or a potential loss given specified changes in (an) underlying market variable(s).</td></tr><tr><td>Long position</td><td>The status of owning or holding more of a given security or commodity than one has contracted to deliver in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>m</td><td>million(s)</td></tr><tr><td>MBS</td><td>Mortgage Backed Securities; a security similar to an asset-backed security, where the underlying assets are loans to owners of residential or commercial real estate secured with a mortgage over the property.</td></tr><tr><td>Market Risk</td><td>The risk of financial loss resulting from adverse changes in market variables, including general market risk factors such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity indices, commodity prices and credit spreads, and factors specific to individual names affecting the values of their securities and other obligations in tradable form, and derivatives linked to those names ("single name exposures").</td></tr><tr><td>Mezz / Mezzanine / Mezz ABS</td><td>A hybrid of debt and equity financing. Mezzanine ABS is typically used to finance the expansion of existing companies, and it is basically debt capital that gives the lender the rights to convert to an ownership or equity interest in the company if the loan is not paid back in time and in full. It is generally subordinated to debt provided by senior lenders such as banks and venture capital companies. Since mezzanine financing is usually provided to the borrower very quickly with little due diligence on the part of the lender and little or no collateral on the part of the borrower, this type of financing is aggressively priced with the lender seeking a return in the 20-30% range.</td></tr><tr><td>MOSG</td><td>The IB's Mortgage Origination Service Group, transferred to DRCM in June 2006</td></tr><tr><td>MRC</td><td>Market Risk Control</td></tr><tr><td>NBI</td><td>New Business Initiative (as defined in relevant UBS Group and Business Group policies)</td></tr><tr><td>NegBasis / Negative Basis Trade</td><td>A negative basis trade is a transaction in which UBS holds a highly rated (generally Super Senior AAA) structural financial asset hedged with a credit default swap on the exact same asset out to full legal maturity. The long position is typically an interest in the most senior tranche of a UBS issued CDO, where the underlying collateral consists of bonds or other securities, such as CMBS, RMBS securities. The protection seller is typically a monoline insurer.</td></tr><tr><td>NIM</td><td>Net Interest Margin certificates</td></tr><tr><td>OIF</td><td>The DRCM Outside Investor Funds</td></tr><tr><td>P&amp;L</td><td>Profit and Loss</td></tr><tr><td>PFCA</td><td>The IB's Principal Finance Credit Arbitrage business, transferred to DRCM in June 2006</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>Quarter</td></tr><tr><td>QRC</td><td>Quantitative Risk Control</td></tr><tr><td>Rating</td><td>Classification by a specialized agency of the credit quality of a corporation, bank, state or special purpose vehicle, or of securities issued by them, essentially expressing probability of default.

It is generally accepted that a FICO score less than 620 is considered Subprime. In addition to having lower FICO scores, Subprime borrowers typically have a loan-to-value ratio ("LTV") in excess of 80%.</td></tr><tr><td>Subprime Losses</td><td>The net losses of USD 18.7 bn in relation to US residential mortgage sector exposures reported by UBS for the year ended 31 December 2007</td></tr><tr><td>Super Senior</td><td>The highest AAA-rated tranche of a CDO.

- Super Seniors hedged at inception through Negative Basis Trades;
- Super Seniors hedged at inception through AMPS trades; and
- Super Seniors unhedged at inception.</td></tr><tr><td>Super Senior 
VFN</td><td>Super Senior variable funding notes are unfunded seniors, mostly in a hybrid or synthetic CDO structure. The holder of this tranche commits to fund under certain conditions: however, the likelihood of these events was assessed as small. The holder earns a premium for assuming this super-senior risk which steps up to LIBOR + Spread if the notes are ever drawn upon.</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1 Capital</td><td>The core component of capital which a bank is required to hold to support its risk-taking activities.
