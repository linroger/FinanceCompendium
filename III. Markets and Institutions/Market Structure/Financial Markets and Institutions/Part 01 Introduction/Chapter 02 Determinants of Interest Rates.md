# nominal interest rates

The interest rates actually observed in financial markets.

Nominal interest rates were relatively high in the 1980s, peaked in the early 1990s, and fell back to and was even below 4 percent in the early and late 2000s. As we discuss in detail in Chapter 4, in 2008 through 2016, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to historic lows as it took steps to stimulate the U.S. economy (which was suffering from its worst recession since the Great Depression).

This chapter examines factors that drive the level of current and future interest rates, as well as the link between interest rates and the time value of money. Sections 1 through 5 (as listed in the Learning Goals for this chapter) generally deal with the levels of interest rates, while Sections 6 through 8 are more concerned with differences among various interest rates. Finally, Section 9 demonstrates how interest rates affect the value of financial securities by reviewing time value of money concepts.

# LOANABLE FUNDS THEORY

Interest rates play a major part in the determination of the value of financial instruments. For example, in June 2013 the Federal Reserve announced that it expected to be able to reduce its efforts to support the U.S. economy as it recovered from the financial crisis of

2008-2009 by the end of 2013. The financial markets reacted significantly: the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which had previously posted three consecutive days of gains in value) declined over 200 points, 1.35 percent in value, the interest rate (for bond instruments the interest rate is most often referred to as the yield to maturity or just yield) on Treasury securities increased (i.e., the yield on two-year T-notes increased from 0.126 percent to 2.308 percent, the highest rate in over a year), gold prices dropped 3.4 percent, and the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies. When the Fed eventually raised interest rates in December 2015 (for the first time in 10 years), the DJIA jumped 224.18 points, or 1.3 percent, to 17,749.09, with only two of the 30 blue-chip companies on the index trading lower. Global equity markets rallied in volatile trading, while the dollar rose after the Fed's statement. However, this rate increase was highly anticipated. In a Reuters poll of more than 90 economists taken between December 4 and 9, the probability that the Fed would raise rates rose to 90 percent. Further, in its announcement, the Fed stressed that the pace of interest rate hikes would be gradual. Thus, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes that yielded 2.294 percent minutes ahead of the announcement, rose to 2.31 percent immediately after the announcement, before falling back to 2.2995 percent. Likewise, gold held steady after the announcement that the interest rate increase was a tentative beginning to a "gradual" tightening cycle.

Even beyond the low rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and several smaller European central banks undertook an unconventional monetary policy of setting negative interest rates. The European Central Bank first made its key interest rate negative in June 2014. As a tool intended to help fight slow economic growth and the threat of deflation then hanging over the euro zone, it was meant to be temporary. Five years later with global economic growth slowing even more, rates were set even lower, reaching  $-0.5$  percent in late 2019. When central banks set negative interest rates, the lender pays the borrower—that is, instead of getting paid for depositing funds with the central bank, the commercial bank now pays the central bank to deposit funds. Negative rates are an extreme version of the standard central bank strategy of reducing borrowing costs to spur consumption and investment—that is, low rates boost demand for credit.

The initial impact of negative interest rates was a boost in the value of the bonds that banks held on their balance sheets. The second impact of the initial rate cut was a boost to bank profitability that came from them borrowing at shorter terms and cheaper rates for lending to customers at higher rates over longer terms. However, negative interest rates can allow a buildup of unsustainable debt as companies and consumers finance purchases. The combination of high leverage and elevated valuations in areas such as real estate also weaken an economy's tolerance for eventual higher rates, forcing central banks to stay accommodative. They can also undermine faith in the banking system, leading to people hoarding banknotes and gold. The policy also throws a lifeline to unproductive firms that crowd out resources and hurt productivity growth. That is one of the lessons from Japan, where rates were cut to zero in the 1990s and set to negative in 2016. The nation's never-ending policy accommodation also suggests that what the economy really needs is structural economic reforms.

Given the impact a change in interest rates has on security values, financial institution and other firm managers spend much time and effort trying to identify factors that determine the level of interest rates at any moment in time, as well as what causes interest rate movements over time. One model that is commonly used to explain interest rates and interest rate movements is the *loanable funds theory*. The loanable funds theory views the level of interest rates as resulting from factors that affect the supply of and demand for loanable funds. It categorizes financial market participants—consumers, businesses, governments, and foreign participants—as net suppliers or demanders of funds.

# LG 2-1 Supply of Loanable Funds

The supply of loanable funds is a term commonly used to describe funds provided to the financial markets by net suppliers of funds. In general, the quantity of loanable funds supplied increases as interest rates rise. Figure 2-2 illustrates the supply curve for loanable funds. Other factors held constant, more funds are supplied as interest rates increase (the reward for supplying funds is higher). Table 2-1 presents data on the supply of loanable funds from the various groups of market participants from U.S. flow of funds data as of 2019.

The household sector (consumer sector) is one of the largest suppliers of loanable funds in the United States—84.66 trillion in 2019. Households supply funds when they have excess income or want to reallocate their asset portfolio holdings. For example, during times of high economic growth, households may replace part of their cash holdings with earning assets (i.e., by supplying loanable funds in exchange for holding securities). As the total wealth of a consumer increases, the total supply of loanable funds from that consumer will also generally increase. Households determine their supply of loanable funds not only on the basis of the general level of interest rates and their total wealth, but also on the risk of securities investments. The greater the perceived risk of securities investments, the less households are willing to invest at each interest rate. Further, the supply of loanable funds from households also depends on their immediate spending needs. For example, near-term educational or medical expenditures will reduce the supply of funds from a given household.

Higher interest rates will also result in higher supplies of funds from the U.S. business sector ($28.06 trillion from nonfinancial business and $98.47 trillion from financial business in 2019), which often has excess cash, or working capital, that it can invest for short periods of time in financial assets. In addition to the interest rates on these investments, the expected risk on financial securities and their businesses' future investment needs will affect their overall supply of funds.

Loanable funds are also supplied by some governments (\$5.66 trillion in 2019). For example, some governments (e.g., municipalities) temporarily generate more cash inflows (e.g., through local taxes) than they have budgeted to spend. These funds can be loaned out to financial market fund users until needed. During the recent financial crisis, the federal government significantly increased the funds it supplied to businesses and consumers as it attempted to rescue the U.S. economy from a deep economic recession (see Appendix 1A).

Finally, foreign investors increasingly view U.S. financial markets as alternatives to their domestic financial markets (27.20 trillion of funds were supplied to the U.S. financial markets in 2019). When interest rates are higher on U.S. financial securities than they are on comparable securities in their home countries, foreign investors increase their supply of funds to U.S. markets. Indeed the high savings rates of foreign households (such as Japanese households) has resulted in foreign market participants being major suppliers of funds to U.S. financial markets in recent years. Similar to domestic suppliers of loanable funds, foreigners assess not only the interest rate offered on financial securities, but also their total wealth, the risk on the security, and their future expenditure needs. Additionally, foreign investors alter their investment decisions as financial conditions in their home countries change relative to the U.S. economy and the exchange rate of their country's currency changes vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (see Chapter 9). For example, during the recent financial crisis, investors worldwide, searching for a safe haven for their funds, invested huge amounts of funds in U.S. Treasury securities. The amount of money invested in Treasury bills from this "flight to quality" was so large that the yield on the three-month Treasury bill went below zero for the first time ever. Investors were essentially paying the U.S. government to borrow money.

LG2-2

# Demand for Loanable Funds

The demand for loanable funds is a term used to describe the total net demand for funds by fund users. In general, the quantity of loanable funds demanded is higher as interest rates fall. Figure 2-2 also illustrates the demand curve for loanable funds. Other factors held constant, more funds are demanded as interest rates decrease (the cost of borrowing funds is lower).

Households (although they are net suppliers of funds) also borrow funds in financial markets (16.05 trillion in 2019). The demand for loanable funds by households reflects the demand for financing purchases of homes (with mortgage loans), durable goods (e.g., car loans, appliance loans), and nondurable goods (e.g., education loans, medical loans). Additional nonprice conditions and requirements (discussed below) also affect a household's demand for loanable funds at every level of interest rates.

Businesses demand funds to finance investments in long-term (fixed) assets (e.g., plant and equipment) and for short-term working capital needs (e.g., inventory and accounts receivable) usually by issuing debt and other financial instruments ( \$66.46 trillion for nonfinancial businesses and\$ 111.87 trillion for financial businesses in 2019). When interest rates are high (i.e., the cost of loanable funds is high), businesses prefer to finance investments with internally generated funds (e.g., retained earnings) rather than through borrowed funds. Further, the greater the number of profitable projects available to businesses, or the better the overall economic conditions, the greater the demand for loanable funds.

Governments also borrow heavily in the markets for loanable funds (28.86 trillion in 2019). For example, state and local governments often issue debt instruments to finance temporary imbalances between operating revenues (e.g., taxes) and budgeted expenditures (e.g., road improvements, school construction). Higher interest rates can cause state and local governments to postpone borrowings and thus capital expenditures. Similar to households and businesses, governments' demand for funds varies with general economic conditions. The federal government is also a large borrower partly to finance current budget deficits (expenditures greater than taxes) and partly to finance past deficits. The cumulative sum of past deficits is called the national debt, which in the United States www.ustreas.gov

in 2019 stood at a record 22.53 trillion. Thus, the national debt and especially the interest payments on the national debt have to be financed in large part by additional government borrowing. Chapter 4 provides details of how government borrowing and spending impacts interest rates as well as overall economic growth.

Finally, foreign participants (households, businesses, and governments) also borrow in U.S. financial markets (20.81 trillion in 2019). Foreign borrowers look for the cheapest source of dollar funds globally. Most foreign borrowing in U.S. financial markets comes from the business sector. In addition to interest costs, foreign borrowers consider nonprice terms on loanable funds as well as economic conditions in their home country and the general attractiveness of the U.S. dollar relative to their domestic currency (e.g., the euro or the yen). In Chapter 9, we examine how economic growth in domestic versus foreign countries affects foreign exchange rates and foreign investors' demand and supply for funds.

LG 2-3

# Equilibrium Interest Rate

The aggregate supply of loanable funds is the sum of the quantity supplied by the separate fund supplying sectors (e.g., households, businesses, governments, foreign agents) discussed above. Similarly, the aggregate demand for loanable funds is the sum of the quantity demanded by the separate fund demanding sectors. As illustrated in Figure 2-3, the aggregate quantity of funds supplied is positively related to interest rates, while the aggregate quantity of funds demanded is inversely related to interest rates. As long as competitive forces are allowed to operate freely in a financial system, the interest rate that equates the aggregate quantity of loanable funds supplied with the aggregate quantity of loanable funds demanded for a financial security,  $Q^{*}$ , is the equilibrium interest rate for that security,  $i^{*}$ , point  $E$  in Figure 2-3. For example, whenever the rate of interest is set higher than the equilibrium rate, such as  $i^{H}$ , the financial system has a surplus of loanable funds. As a result, some suppliers of funds will lower the interest rate at which they are willing to lend and the demanders of funds will absorb the loanable funds surplus. In contrast, when the rate of interest is lower than the equilibrium interest rate, such as  $i^{L}$ , there is a shortage of loanable funds in the financial system. Some borrowers will be unable to obtain the funds they need at current rates. As a result, interest rates will increase, causing more suppliers of loanable funds to enter the market and some demanders of funds to leave the market. These competitive forces will cause the quantity of funds supplied to increase and the quantity of funds demanded to decrease until a shortage of funds no longer exists.

# Factors That Cause the Supply and Demand Curves

# for Loanable Funds to Shift

While we have alluded to the fundamental factors that cause the supply and demand curves for loanable funds to shift, in this section we formally summarize these factors. We then examine how shifts in the supply and demand curves for loanable funds determine the equilibrium interest rate on a specific financial instrument. A shift in the supply or demand curve occurs when the quantity of a financial security supplied or demanded changes at every given interest rate in response to a change in another factor besides the interest rate. In either case, a change in the supply or demand curve for loanable funds causes interest rates to move. Table 2-2 recaps the factors that affect the supply and demand for loanable funds discussed in this section, their impact on the supply and demand for loanable funds for a specific security, and the impact on the market clearing (or equilibrium) interest rates holding all other factors constant.

Supply of Funds. We have already described the positive relation between interest rates and the supply of loanable funds along the loanable funds supply curve. Factors that cause the supply curve of loanable funds to shift, at any given interest rate, include the wealth of fund suppliers, the risk of the financial security, near-term spending needs, monetary policy objectives, and economic conditions.

*A "direct" impact on equilibrium interest rates means that as the "factor" increases (decreases) the equilibrium interest rate increases (decreases). An "inverse" impact means that as the factor increases (decreases) the equilibrium interest rate decreases (increases).

Wealth. As the total wealth of financial market participants (households, businesses, etc.) increases, the absolute dollar value available for investment purposes increases. Accordingly, at every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds increases, or the supply curve shifts down and to the right. For example, as the U.S. economy grew in the early and mid-2010s, total wealth of U.S. investors increased as well. Consequently, the supply of funds available for investing (e.g., in stock and bond markets) increased at every available interest rate. We show this shift (increase) in the supply curve in Panel a of Figure 2-4 as a move from  $SS$  to  $SS^{\prime \prime}$ . The shift in the supply curve creates a disequilibrium between demand and supply. To eliminate the imbalance or disequilibrium in this financial market, the equilibrium interest rate falls, from  $i^{*}$  to  $i^{*''}$ , which is associated with an increase in the quantity of funds loaned between fund suppliers and fund demanders from  $Q^{*}$  to  $Q^{*''}$ .

Conversely, as the total wealth of financial market participants decreases, the absolute dollar value available for investment purposes decreases. Accordingly, at every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds decreases, or the supply curve shifts up and to the left. The decrease in the supply of funds due to a decrease in the total wealth of market participants results in an increase in the equilibrium interest rate and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of funds loaned (traded).

Risk. As the risk of a financial security decreases (e.g., the probability that the issuer of the security will default on promised repayments of the funds borrowed), it becomes more attractive to suppliers of funds. At every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds increases, or the supply curve shifts down and to the right, from  $SS$  to  $SS''$  in Panel a of Figure 2-4. Holding all other factors constant, the increase in the supply of funds, due to a decrease in the risk of the financial security, results in a decrease in the equilibrium interest rate, from  $i^*$  to  $i^{**}$ , and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of funds traded, from  $Q^*$  to  $Q^{**}$ .

Conversely, as the risk of a financial security increases, it becomes less attractive to suppliers of funds. Accordingly, at every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds decreases, or the supply curve shifts up and to the left. Holding all other factors constant, the decrease in the supply of funds due to an increase in the financial security's risk results in an increase in the equilibrium interest rate and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of funds loaned (or traded). For example, during the financial crisis, the Baa corporate bond rates spiked and 10-year T-note rates dropped significantly as suppliers of funds moved away from riskier investments (Baa corporate bonds) to the safest possible investments (Treasury notes). In the loanable funds framework, this can be interpreted as a reduction in the supply of funds, due to investor uncertainty about credit quality of firms in the corporate bond market and as an increase in the supply of funds in the Treasury notes market, as investors fled to quality investments. Consequently, the equilibrium interest rate was higher in the corporate bond market and lower in the Treasury notes market.

Near-Term Spending Needs. When financial market participants have few near-term spending needs, the absolute dollar value of funds available to invest increases. For example, when a family's son or daughter moves out of the family home to live on his or her own, current spending needs of the family decrease and the supply of available funds (for investing) increases. At every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds increases, or the supply curve shifts down and to the right. The financial market, holding all other factors constant, reacts to this increased supply of funds by decreasing the equilibrium interest rate and increasing the equilibrium quantity of funds traded.

Conversely, when financial market participants have increased near-term spending needs, the absolute dollar value of funds available to invest decreases. At every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds decreases, or the supply curve shifts up and to the left. The shift in the supply curve creates a disequilibrium in the financial market that results in an increase in the equilibrium interest rate and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of funds loaned (or traded).

Monetary Expansion. One method used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy is to alter the availability of funds, the growth in the money supply, and thus the rate of economic expansion of the economy (we explain this process in detail in Chapter 4). When monetary policy objectives are to allow the economy to expand (as was the case in the late 2000s, during the financial crisis, and in the early 2010s), the Federal Reserve increases the supply of funds available in the financial markets. At every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds increases, the supply curve shifts down and to the right, and the equilibrium interest rate falls, while the equilibrium quantity of funds traded increases.

Conversely, when monetary policy objectives are to restrict the rate of economic expansion (and thus inflation), the Federal Reserve decreases the supply of funds available in the financial markets. At every interest rate, the supply of loanable funds decreases, the supply curve shifts up and to the left, and the equilibrium interest rate rises, while the equilibrium quantity of funds loaned or traded decreases.

Economic Conditions. Finally, as the underlying economic conditions themselves (e.g., the inflation rate, unemployment rate, economic growth) improve in a country relative to other countries, the flow of funds to that country increases. This reflects the lower risk

(country or sovereign risk) that the country, in the guise of its government, will default on its obligation to repay funds borrowed. For example, the severe economic crisis in Turkey in the late 2010s resulted in a decrease in the supply of funds to that country. An increased inflow of foreign funds to U.S. financial markets increases the supply of loanable funds at every interest rate and the supply curve shifts down and to the right. Accordingly, the equilibrium interest rate falls and the equilibrium quantity of funds loaned or traded increases.

Conversely, when economic conditions in foreign countries improve, domestic and foreign investors take their funds out of domestic financial markets (e.g., the United States) and invest abroad. Thus, the supply of funds available in the financial markets decreases and the equilibrium interest rate rises, while the equilibrium quantity of funds traded decreases.

Demand for Funds. We explained above that the quantity of loanable funds demanded is negatively related to interest rates. Factors that cause the demand curve for loanable funds to shift include the utility derived from assets purchased with borrowed funds, the restrictiveness of nonprice conditions on borrowing, and economic conditions.

Utility Derived from Assets Purchased with Borrowed Funds. As the utility (i.e., satisfaction or pleasure) derived from an asset purchased with borrowed funds increases, the willingness of market participants (households, businesses, etc.) to borrow increases and the absolute dollar value borrowed increases. Accordingly, at every interest rate, the demand for loanable funds increases, or the demand curve shifts up and to the right. For example, suppose a change in jobs takes an individual from Arizona to Minnesota. The individual currently has a convertible automobile. Given the move to Minnesota, the individual's utility from the convertible decreases, while it would increase for a car with heated seats. Thus, with a potential increased utility from the purchase of a new car, the individual's demand for funds in the form of an auto loan increases. We show this shift (increase) in the demand curve in Panel b of Figure 2-4 as a move from  $DD$  to  $DD''$ . The shift in the demand curve creates a disequilibrium in this financial market. Holding all other factors constant, the increase in the demand for funds due to an increase in the utility from the purchased asset results in an increase in the equilibrium interest rate, from  $i^*$  to  $i^{*''}$ , and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of funds traded, from  $Q^*$  to  $Q^{*''}$ .

Conversely, as the utility derived from an asset purchased with borrowed funds decreases, the willingness of market participants (households, businesses, etc.) to borrow decreases and the absolute dollar amount borrowed decreases. Accordingly, at every interest rate, the demand for loanable funds decreases, or the demand curve shifts down and to the left. The shift in the demand curve again creates a disequilibrium in this financial market. As competitive forces adjust, and holding all other factors constant, the decrease in the demand for funds due to a decrease in the utility from the purchased asset results in a decrease in the equilibrium interest rate and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of funds loaned or traded.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1. Who the main suppliers of loanable funds are?
2. Who the major demanders of loanable funds are?
3. What happens to the equilibrium interest rate when the demand for loanable funds increases?
4. What happens to the equilibrium interest rate when the supply of loanable funds increases?
5. How supply and demand, together, determine interest rates?

Restrictiveness of Nonprice Conditions on Borrowed Funds. As the nonprice restrictions put on borrowers as a condition of borrowing decrease, the willingness of market participants to borrow increases and the absolute dollar value borrowed increases. Such nonprice conditions may include fees, collateral, or requirements or restrictions on the use of funds (so-called restrictive covenants; see Chapter 6). The lack of such restrictions makes the loan more desirable to the user of funds. Accordingly, at every interest rate, the demand for loanable funds increases, or the demand curve shifts up and to the right, from  $DD$  to  $DD^{\prime \prime}$ . As competitive forces adjust, and holding all other factors constant, the increase in the demand for funds due to a decrease in the restrictive conditions on the borrowed funds results in an increase in the equilibrium interest rate, from  $i^{*}$  to  $i^{*''}$ , and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of funds traded, from  $Q^{*}$  to  $Q^{*''}$ .

Conversely, as the nonprice restrictions put on borrowers as a condition of borrowing increase, market participants' willingness to borrow decreases, and the absolute dollar value borrowed decreases. Accordingly, the demand curve shifts down and to the left.

The shift in the demand curve results in a decrease in the equilibrium interest rate and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of funds traded.

Economic Conditions. When the domestic economy experiences a period of growth, such as that in the United States in the mid-2000s and 2010s, market participants are willing to borrow more heavily. For example, state and local governments are more likely to repair and improve decaying infrastructure when the local economy is strong. Accordingly, the demand curve for funds shifts up and to the right. Holding all other factors constant, the increase in the demand for funds due to economic growth results in an increase in the equilibrium interest rate and an increase in the equilibrium quantity of funds traded.

Conversely, when domestic economic growth is stagnant, market participants reduce their demand for funds. Accordingly, the demand curve shifts down and to the left, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium interest rate and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of funds traded.

# MOVEMENT OF INTEREST RATES OVER TIME

# LG 2-5

As discussed in the previous section of this chapter, the loanable funds theory of interest rates is based on the supply of and demand for loanable funds as functions of interest rates. The equilibrium interest rate (point  $E$  in Figure 2-4) is only a temporary equilibrium. Changes in underlying factors that determine the demand for and supply of loanable funds can cause continuous shifts in the supply and/or demand curves for loanable funds. Market forces will react to the resulting disequilibrium with a change in the equilibrium interest rate and quantity of funds traded in that market. Refer again to Panel a of Figure 2-4, which shows the effects of an increase in the supply curve for loanable funds, from SS to  $SS^{\prime \prime}$  (and the resulting decrease in the equilibrium interest rate, from  $i^{*}$  to  $i^{*\prime \prime}$ ), while Panel b of Figure 2-4 shows the effects of an increase in the demand curve for loanable funds, from  $DD$  to  $DD^{\prime \prime}$  (and the resulting increase in the equilibrium interest rate, from  $i^{*}$  to  $i^{*\prime \prime}$ ).

# DETERMINANTS OF INTEREST RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES

# LG 2-6

So far we have looked at the general determination of equilibrium (nominal) interest rates for financial securities in the context of the loanable demand and supply theory of the flow of funds. In this section, we examine the specific factors that affect differences in interest rates across the range of real-world financial markets (i.e., differences among interest rates on individual securities, given the underlying level of interest rates determined by the demand and supply of loanable funds). These factors include inflation, the "real" risk-free rate, default risk, liquidity risk, special provisions regarding the use of funds raised by a security's issuance, and the term to maturity of the security. We examine each of these factors in this section and summarize them in Table 2-3.

# TABLE 2-3 Factors Affecting Nominal Interest Rates

Inflation—the continual increase in the price level of a basket of goods and services.

Real risk-free rate—nominal risk-free rate that would exist on a security if no inflation were expected.

Default risk—risk that a security issuer will default on the security by missing an interest or principal payment.

Liquidity risk—risk that a security cannot be sold at a predictable price with low transaction costs at short notice.

Special provisions—provisions (e.g., taxability, convertibility, and callability) that impact the security holder beneficially or adversely and as such are reflected in the interest rates on securities that contain such provisions.

Term to maturity—length of time a security has until maturity.

# inflation

The continual increase in the price level of a basket of goods and services.

# Inflation

The first factor to affect interest rates is actual or expected inflation in the economy. Inflation of the general price index of goods and services  $(IP)$  is defined as the (percentage) increase in the price of a standardized basket of goods and services over a given period of time. The higher the level of actual or expected inflation, the higher will be the level of interest rates. The intuition behind the positive relationship between interest rates and inflation rates is that an investor who buys a financial asset must earn a higher interest rate when inflation increases to compensate for the increased cost of forgoing consumption of real goods and services today and buying these more highly priced goods and services in the future. In other words, the higher the rate of inflation, the more expensive the same basket of goods and services will be in the future. In the United States, inflation is measured using indexes such as the consumer price index  $(CPI)$  and the producer price index  $(PPI)$ . For example, the annual inflation rate using the CPI index between years  $t$  and  $t + 1$  would be equal to:

$$
\text{Inflation}(IP) = \frac{CPI_{t+1} - CPI_{t}}{CPI_{t}} \times 100
$$

# real risk-free rate

The risk-free rate that would exist on a default-free security if no inflation were expected.

# Real Risk-Free Rates

A real risk-free rate is the interest rate that would exist on a risk-free security if no inflation were expected over the holding period (e.g., a year) of a security. The real risk-free rate on an investment is the percentage change in the buying power of a dollar. As such, it measures society's relative time preference for consuming today rather than tomorrow. The higher society's preference to consume today (i.e., the higher its time value of money or rate of time preference), the higher the real risk-free rate (RFR) will be.

Fisher Effect. The relationship among the real risk-free rate (RFR), the expected rate of inflation  $[E(IP)]$ , described above, and the nominal interest rate  $(i)$  is often referred to as the Fisher effect, named for the economist Irving Fisher, who identified these relationships early last century. The Fisher effect theorizes that nominal risk-free rates observed in financial markets (e.g., the one-year Treasury bill rate) must compensate investors for (1) any reduced purchasing power on funds lent (or principal lent) due to inflationary price changes and (2) an additional premium above the expected rate of inflation for forgiving present consumption (which reflects the real risk-free rate discussed above), or

$$
(1 + i) = [ 1 + E (I P) ] (1 + R F R)
$$

Rearranging this relation, when an investor purchases a security that pays interest, the nominal risk-free rate exceeds the real risk-free rate because of inflation.

$$ i = R F R + E (I P) + \left[ R F R \times E (I P) \right]
$$ where  $RFR \times E(IP)$  is the inflation premium for the loss of purchasing power on the promised nominal risk-free rate payments due to inflation. For small values of  $RFR$  and  $E(IP)$  this term is negligible.


Thus, the Fisher effect formula is often written as:

$$ i = R F R + E (I P) \tag {2-1}
$$

The approximation formula, in Equation (2-1), assumes  $RFR \times E(IP)$  is small. Thus, the nominal risk-free rate will be equal to the real risk-free rate only when market participants expect the inflation rate to be zero— $E(IP) = 0$ . Similarly, nominal risk-free rates will be equal to the expected inflation rate only when real risk-free rates are zero. Note that we can rearrange the nominal risk-free rate equation to show the determinants of the real risk-free rate as follows:

$$
R F R = i - E (I P) \tag {2-2}
$$

# EXAMPLE 2-1 Calculations of Real Risk-Free Rates

The one-year Treasury bill rate in 2018 averaged 2.25 percent and inflation (measured by the consumer price index) for the year was 1.90 percent. If investors had expected the same inflation rate as that actually realized (i.e., 1.90 percent), then according to the Fisher effect the real risk-free rate for 2018 was:

$$
DRP_{Aaa} = 2.98\% - 1.47\% = 1.51\%
$$

$$
DRP_{Baa} = 3.87\% - 1.47\% = 2.40\%
$$

The one-year T-bill rate in 2019 was 1.75 percent, while the CPI change for the year was 1.80 percent. This implies a real risk-free rate of $-0.05\%$—that is, the real risk-free rate was actually negative.

stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm

Panel a of Figure 2-5 shows the nominal risk-free rate (one-year T-bill rate) versus the change in the CPI from 1962 through 2019. Panel b shows the difference in the two rates (i.e., the real risk-free rate over the period). Because the expected inflation rate is difficult to estimate accurately, the real risk-free rate can be difficult to estimate accurately as well, since investors' expectations are not always realized. Figure 2-5 shows the realized inflation and real risk-free rates.

# default risk

The risk that a security issuer will default on that security by being late on or missing an interest or principal payment.

# Default or Credit Risk

Default risk is the risk that a security issuer will fail to make its promised interest and principal payments to the buyer of a security. The higher the default risk, the higher the interest rate that will be demanded by the buyer of the security to compensate him or her for this default (or credit) risk exposure. Not all securities exhibit default risk. For example, U.S. Treasury securities are regarded as having no default risk since they are issued by the U.S. government, and the probability of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt payments is practically zero given its taxation powers and its ability to print currency. Some borrowers, however, such as corporations or individuals, have less predictable cash flows (and no taxation powers), and therefore investors charge them an interest rate risk premium reflecting their perceived probability of default and the potential recovery of the amount loaned. The difference between a quoted interest rate on a security ( $\text{security } j$ ) and a Treasury security with similar maturity, liquidity, tax, and other features (such as callability or convertibility) is called a default or credit risk premium ( $DRP_{j}$ ). That is:

$$
D R P_{j} = i_{j t} - i_{T t} \tag {2-3}
$$ where


$i_{jt}$  = interest rate on a security issued by a non-Treasury issuer (issuer  $j$ ) of maturity  $m$  at time  $t$
$i_{Tt} =$  interest rate on a security issued by the U.S. Treasury of maturity  $m$  at time  $t$ www.moodys.com

The default risk on many corporate bonds is evaluated and categorized by various bond rating agencies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's. (We discuss these ratings in more detail in Chapter 6.)

In September 2019, the 10-year Treasury interest rate, or yield, was 1.47 percent. On Aaa-rated and Baa-rated corporate debt, interest rates were 2.98 and 3.87 percent, respectively. Thus, the average default risk premiums on the Aaa-rated and Baa-rated corporate debt were:

$$

D R P_{A a a} = 2.98 \% - 1.47 \% = 1.51 \%

$$

$$

D R P_{B a a} = 3.87 \% - 1.47 \% = 2.40 \%

$$

Figure 2-6 presents these risk premiums from 1977 through 2019. Notice from this figure and Figure 2-5 that default risk premiums tend to increase when the economy is contracting and decrease when the economy is expanding. For example, from 2008 to 2009 real risk-free rates (T-bills/CPI in Figure 2-5) decreased from 1.73 percent to  $-2.23$  percent. Over the same period, default risk premiums on Aaa-rated bonds increased from 1.97 percent to 2.05 percent and on Baa-rated bonds from 3.78 percent to 4.03 percent. Conversely, from 2009 to 2010, the real risk-free rate increased from  $-2.23$  percent to  $-1.18$  percent. Over this period, default risk premiums on Aaa-rated bonds decreased from 2.05 percent to 1.67 percent and on Baa-rated bonds from 4.03 percent to 2.92 percent.

# liquidity risk

The risk that a security can be sold at a predictable price with low transaction costs on short notice.

# Liquidity Risk

A highly liquid asset is one that can be sold at a predictable price with low transaction costs and thus can be converted into its full market value at short notice. If a security is illiquid, investors add a liquidity risk premium (LRP) to the interest rate on the security that reflects its relative liquidity. In the United States, liquid markets exist for most government securities and the stocks and some bonds issued by large corporations. Many bonds, however, do not trade on a regular basis or on organized exchanges such as the NYSE. As a result, if investors wish to sell these bonds quickly, they may get a lower price than they could have received if they had waited until maturity to sell the bonds. Consequently, investors demand a liquidity premium on top of all other premiums to compensate for the bond's lack of liquidity and the potential price discount from selling it early. Thus, the liquidity risk premium might also be thought of as an "illiquidity" premium.

A different type of liquidity risk premium may also exist (see below) if investors dislike long-term securities because their prices (present values) are more sensitive to interest rate changes than short-term securities (see Chapter 3). In this case, a higher liquidity risk premium may be added to a security with a longer maturity simply because of its greater exposure to price risk (loss of capital value) on the security as interest rates change.

# Special Provisions or Covenants

Numerous special provisions or covenants that may be written into the contract underlying a security also affect the interest rates on different securities (see Chapter 6). Some of these special provisions include the security's taxability, convertibility, and callability.

For example, for investors, interest payments on municipal securities are free of federal, state, and local taxes. Thus, the interest rate required by a municipal bond holder is smaller than that on a comparable taxable bond—for example, a Treasury bond, which is taxable at the federal level but not at the state or local (city) levels, or a corporate bond, whose interest payments are taxable at the state and local levels as well as federal levels.

A convertible (special) feature of a security offers the holder the opportunity to exchange one security for another type of the issuer's securities at a preset price. Because of the value of this conversion option, the convertible security holder requires a lower interest rate than a comparable nonconvertible security holder (all else equal). In general, special provisions that provide benefits to the security holder (e.g., tax-free status and convertibility) are associated with lower interest rates, and special provisions that provide benefits to the security issuer (e.g., callability, by which an issuer has the option to retire—call—a security prior to maturity at a preset price) are associated with higher interest rates.

# Term to Maturity

# term structure of interest rates

A comparison of market yields on securities, assuming all characteristics except maturity are the same.

Interest rates are also related to the term to maturity of a security. This relationship is often called the term structure of interest rates or the yield curve. The term structure of interest rates compares interest rates on securities, assuming that all characteristics (i.e., default risk, liquidity risk) except maturity are the same. The change in required interest rates as the maturity of a security changes is called the maturity premium (MP). The MP, or the difference between the required yield on long- and short-term securities of the same characteristics except maturity can be positive, negative, or zero. The term structure of interest rates for U.S. Treasury securities is the most frequently reported and analyzed yield curve. The shape of the yield curve on Treasury securities has taken many forms over the years, but the three most common shapes are shown in Figure 2-7. In Panel a, the yield curve on February 18, 2018, yields rise steadily with maturity when the yield curve is upward sloping. This is the most common yield curve, so that on average the MP is positive. Panel b shows an inverted or downward-sloping yield curve, reported on August 15, 2019, for which yields decline as maturity increases. Inverted yield curves do not generally last very long, yet it is often a sign of an impending economic downturn. Finally, Panel c shows a flat yield curve, reported on December 18, 2018, in which the yield is virtually unaffected by the term to maturity.

Note that these yield curves may reflect factors other than investors' preferences for the maturity of a security, since in reality there may be liquidity differences among the securities traded at different points along the yield curve. For example, yields on newly issued 30-year Treasury bonds may be less than yields on (seasoned issues) 10-year Treasury bonds if investors prefer new ("on the run") securities to previously issued ("off the run") securities. Specifically, since (historically) the Treasury issues new 10-year notes and 30-year bonds only at the long end of the maturity spectrum, an existing 10-year Treasury bond would have to have been issued 20 years previously (i.e., it was originally a 30-year bond when it was issued 20 years previously). The increased demand for the newly issued "liquid" 30-year Treasury bonds relative to the less liquid 10-year Treasury bonds can be large enough to push the equilibrium interest rate on the 30-year Treasury bonds below that on the 10-year Treasury bonds and even below short-term rates. In the next section, we review three major theories that are often used to explain the shape of the yield curve.

Putting the factors that impact interest rates in different markets together, we can use the following general equation to determine the factors that functionally impact the fair interest rate  $(i_j^*)$  on an individual (jth) financial security:

$$ i_{j}^{*} = f (I P, R F R, D R P_{j}, L R P_{j}, S C P_{j}, M P_{j}) \tag {2-4}
$$

# TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES

LG 2-7

As discussed previously in the context of the maturity premium, the relationship between a security's interest rate and its remaining term to maturity (the term structure of interest rates) can take a number of different shapes. Explanations for the shape of the yield curve fall predominantly into three theories: the unbiased expectations theory, the liquidity premium theory, and the market segmentation theory. Table 2-4 summarizes the theories. We discuss them in detail below. Review again Panel a in Figure 2-7, which presents the Treasury yield curve as of February 18, 2018. As can be seen, the yield curve on this date reflected the normal upward-sloping relationship between yield and maturity.

# Unbiased Expectations Theory

According to the unbiased expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates, at a given point in time the yield curve reflects the market's current expectations of future short-term rates. As illustrated in Figure 2-8, the intuition behind the unbiased expectations theory is that if investors have a four-year investment horizon, they could either buy a current, four-year bond and earn the current or spot yield on a four-year bond ( $_{1}R_{4}$ , if held to maturity) each year, or invest in four successive one-year bonds—of which they know only the current one-year spot rate ( $_{1}R_{1}$ ), but form expectations of the unknown future one-year rates  $[E(_{2}r_{1}), E(_{3}r_{1})$ , and  $E(_{4}r_{1})]$ . Note that each interest rate term has two subscripts, for example,  $_{1}R_{4}$ . The first subscript indicates the period in which the security is bought, so that 1 represents the purchase of a security in period 1. The second subscript indicates the maturity on the security, so that 4 represents the purchase of a security with a four-year life. Similarly,  $E(_{3}r_{1})$  is the expected return on a security with a one-year life purchased in period 3.

In equilibrium, the return to holding a four-year bond to maturity should equal the expected return to investing in four successive one-year bonds. If this equality does not hold, an arbitrage opportunity exists. For example, if the investor could earn more on the one-year bond investments, he could short (or sell) the four-year bond, use the proceeds to buy the four successive one-year bonds, and earn a guaranteed profit over the four-year investment horizon. Thus, according to the unbiased expectations theory, if future one-year rates are expected to rise each successive year into the future, then the yield curve will slope upward. Specifically, the current four-year T-bond rate will exceed the three-year

# TABLE 2-4 Explanations for the Shape of the Term Structure of Interest Rates

Unbiased expectations theory—at any given point in time, the yield curve reflects the market's current expectations of future short-term rates. According to the unbiased expectations theory, the return for holding a four-year bond to maturity should equal the expected return for investing in four successive one-year bonds (as long as the market is in equilibrium).

Liquidity premium theory—long-term rates are equal to geometric averages of current and expected short-term rates, plus liquidity risk premiums that increase with the security's maturity. Longer maturities on securities mean greater market and liquidity risk. So, investors will hold long-term maturities only when they are offered at a premium to compensate for future uncertainty in the security's value. The liquidity premium increases as maturity increases.

Market segmentation theory—assumes that investors do not consider securities with different maturities as perfect substitutes. Rather, individual investors and FIs have preferred investment horizons (habitats) dictated by the nature of the liabilities they hold. Thus, interest rates are determined by distinct supply and demand conditions within a particular maturity segment (e.g., the short end and long end of the bond market).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/8d04a5ac-85cd-4263-9695-9d761733496f/c72e2df03d35b185eb4dbee3d60c5e7341edce9e9a574df86eb5275fb9457149.jpg) bond rate, which will exceed the two-year bond rate, and so on. Similarly, if future one-year rates are expected to remain constant each successive year into the future, then the four-year bond rate will be equal to the three-year bond rate—that is, the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over the relevant time period. Specifically, the unbiased expectations theory posits that current long-term interest rates  $(_{1}R_{N})$  are geometric averages of current  $(_{1}R_{1})$  and expected future  $E(_{N}r_{1})$  short-term interest rates. The mathematical equation representing this relationship is:

Figure 2-8 Unbiased Expectations Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates

$$
{}_{1}R_{N} = \left[ (1 + {}_{1}R_{1})(1 + E({}_{2}r_{1})) \dots (1 + E({}_{N}r_{1})) \right]^{1/N} - 1
$$

{ }_{ 1 } R_{ N } = \left[ ( 1 + { }_{ 1 } R_{ 1 } ) ( 1 + E ( { }_{ 2 } r_{ 1 } ) ) \dots ( 1 + E ( { }_{ N } r_{ 1 } ) ) \right]^{ 1 / N } - 1

$$ where


${}_{1}{R}_{N} =$  Actual  $N$  -period rate today (i.e.,the first day of year 1)

$N =$  Term to maturity,  $N = 1,2,\dots ,4,\dots$

${}_{1}{R}_{1} =$  Actual current one-year rate today

$E(i r_{1}) =$  Expected one-year rates for years,  $i = 2,3,4,\dots ,N$  in the future

Notice that uppercase interest rate terms,  ${}_{1}R_{t}$ , are the actual current interest rates on securities purchased today with a maturity of  $t$  years. Lowercase interest rate terms,  ${}_{t}r_{1}$ , are estimates of future one-year interest rates starting  $t$  years into the future.

# EXAMPLE 2-2 Construction of a Yield Curve Using the Unbiased Expectations Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates

Suppose that the current one-year rate (one-year spot rate) and expected one-year T-bond rates over the following three years (i.e., years 2, 3, and 4, respectively) are as follows:

$$

{}_{1}R_{1} = 1.94\% ,\quad E(_{2}r_{1}) = 3.00\% ,\quad E(_{3}r_{1}) = 3.74\% ,\quad E(_{4}r_{1}) = 4.10\%

$$

Using the unbiased expectations theory, current (or today's) rates for one-, two-, three-, and four-year maturity Treasury securities should be:

$$

\begin{array}{l} { }_{ 1 } R_{ 1 } = 1 . 94 \% \\ { }_{ 1 } R_{ 2 } = \left[ ( 1 + 0 . 0 1 9 4 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 ) \right]^{ 1 / 2 } - 1 = 2 . 4 7 \% \\ { }_{ 1 } R_{ 3 } = [ ( 1 + 0 . 0 1 9 4 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 7 4 ) ]^{ 1 / 3 } - 1 = 2 . 8 9 \% \\ { }_{ 1 } R_{ 4 } = [ ( 1 + 0 . 0 1 9 4 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 7 4 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 4 1 ) ]^{ 1 / 4 } - 1 = 3 . 1 9 \% \\ \end{array}

$$ and the current yield curve will be upward sloping as shown:


![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/8d04a5ac-85cd-4263-9695-9d761733496f/f273a6b81a1acc2bad119bcfe42a4ad4b613f1c1135ae56140e37d7707aa4b8d.jpg)

This upward-sloping yield curve reflects the market's expectation of persistently rising one-year (short-term) interest rates over the future horizon.

# Liquidity Premium Theory

A weakness of the unbiased expectations theory is that it assumes that investors are equally willing to invest in short-term and long-term securities with no additional reward (in the form of higher interest rates) to compensate them for any added risk from locking in their funds in long-term securities—that is, it assumes investors are risk neutral. However, with uncertainty about future interest rates (and future monetary policy actions) and hence about future security prices, these instruments become risky in the sense that the return over a future investment period is unknown. In other words, because of future uncertainty of returns, there is a risk in holding long-term securities, and that risk increases with the security's maturity—that is, investors are risk averse.

The second theory, the liquidity premium theory of the term structure of interest rates, is an extension of the unbiased expectations theory. It is based on the idea that investors will hold long-term maturities only if they are offered at a premium to compensate for future uncertainty in a security's value, which increases with an asset's maturity. Specifically, in a world of uncertainty, short-term securities provide greater marketability (due to their more active secondary market) and have less price risk (due to smaller price fluctuations for a given change in interest rates) than long-term securities. As a result, investors prefer to hold shorter-term securities because they can be converted into cash with little risk of a capital loss (i.e., a fall in the price of the security below its original purchase price). Thus, investors must be offered a liquidity premium to buy longer-term securities which have a higher risk of capital losses. This difference in price or liquidity risk can be directly related to the fact that longer-term securities are more sensitive to interest rate changes in the market than are shorter-term securities—see Chapter 3 for a discussion on bond interest rate sensitivity and the link to a bond's maturity or duration. Because the longer the maturity on a security the greater its risk, the liquidity premium increases as maturity increases.

The liquidity premium theory states that long-term rates are equal to geometric averages of current and expected short-term rates (as under the unbiased expectations theory), plus liquidity risk premiums that increase with the maturity of the security. Figure 2-9 illustrates the differences in the shape of the yield curve under the unbiased expectations theory versus the liquidity premium theory. For example, Panel c of Figure 2-9 shows that according to the liquidity premium theory, an upward-sloping yield curve may reflect investors' expectations that future short-term rates will be flat, but because liquidity premiums increase with maturity, the yield curve will nevertheless be upward sloping. Indeed, an upward-sloping yield curve may reflect expectations that future interest rates will rise (Panel a), be flat (Panel c), or even fall (Panel b), as long as the liquidity premium increases with maturity fast enough to produce an upward-sloping yield curve. The liquidity premium theory may be mathematically represented as:

# EXAMPLE 2-3 Construction of a Yield Curve Using the Liquidity Premium Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates

Suppose that the current one-year rate (one-year spot rate) and expected one-year T-bond rates over the following three years (i.e., years 2, 3, and 4, respectively) are as follows:

$$

{ }_{ 1 } R_{ 1 } = 1 . 94 \% , \quad E (_{ 2 } r_{ 1 } ) = 3 . 00 \% , \quad E (_{ 3 } r_{ 1 } ) = 3 . 74 \% , \quad E (_{ 4 } r_{ 1 } ) = 4 . 10 \%

$$

In addition, investors charge a liquidity premium on longer-term securities such that:

$$

L_{2} = 0.10 \%, \quad L_{3} = 0.20 \%, \quad L_{4} = 0.30 \%

$$

Using the liquidity premium theory, current rates for one-, two-, three-, and four-year maturity Treasury securities should be:

$$

\begin{array}{l} { }_{ 1 } R_{ 1 } = 1 . 94 \% \\ { }_{ 1 } R_{ 2 } = [ ( 1 + 0 . 0 1 9 4 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 0 0 1 ) ]^{ 1 / 2 } - 1 = 2 . 5 2 \% \\ { }_{ 1 } R_{ 3 } = \left[ ( 1 + 0 . 0 1 9 4 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 0 0 1 ) ( 1 + 0 . 0 3 7 4 + 0 . 0 0 2 ) \right]^{ 1 / 3 } - 1 = 2 . 9 9 \% \\ \begin{aligned} {}_{1}R_{4} & = [(1 + 0.0194)(1 + 0.03 + 0.001)(1 + 0.0374 + 0.002)(1 + 0.041 + 0.003)]^{1 / 4} - 1\\ & = 3.34\% \end{aligned} \\ \end{array}

$$ and the current yield curve will be upward sloping as shown:


![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/8d04a5ac-85cd-4263-9695-9d761733496f/ea9370d684a504d167277e753b48f0233ea8005d51a63089ea2b4ec43a47a6a7.jpg)

Comparing the yield curves in Example 2-2 and this example, notice that the liquidity premium in year 2 ( $L_{2} = 0.10\%$ ) produces a 0.05 percent premium on the yield to maturity on a two-year T-note, the liquidity premium for year 3 ( $L_{3} = 0.20\%$ ) produces a 0.10 percent premium on the yield to maturity on the three-year T-note, and the liquidity premium for year 4 ( $L_{4} = 0.30\%$ ) produces a 0.15 percent premium on the yield to maturity on the four-year T-note.

# Market Segmentation Theory

A weakness of both the unbiased expectations and liquidity premium theories is that they assume that investors have no preference when it comes to different maturities and the risks associated with them. The market segmentation theory argues that individual investors and FIs have specific maturity preferences, and to get them to hold securities with maturities other than their most preferred requires a higher interest rate (maturity premium). Accordingly, the market segmentation theory does not consider securities with different maturities as perfect substitutes. Rather, individual investors and FIs have preferred investment horizons (habitats) dictated by the nature of the liabilities they hold (i.e., investors have complete risk aversion for securities outside their maturity preferences). For example, banks might prefer to hold relatively short-term U.S. Treasury bonds because of the short-term nature of their deposit liabilities, while insurance companies may prefer to hold long-term U.S. Treasury bonds because of the long-term nature of their life insurance contractual liabilities. Accordingly, interest rates are determined by distinct supply and demand conditions within a particular maturity segment (e.g., the short end and

long end of the bond market). The market segmentation theory assumes that investors and borrowers are generally unwilling to shift from one maturity sector to another without adequate compensation in the form of an interest rate premium. Figure 2-10 demonstrates how changes in the supply curve for short- versus long-term bond segments of the market result in changes in the shape of the yield curve. Specifically in Figure 2-10, the higher the yield on securities (the lower the price), the higher the demand for them.4 Thus, as the supply of securities decreases in the short-term market and increases in the long-term market, the slope of the yield curve becomes steeper. If the supply of short-term securities had increased while the supply of long-term securities had decreased, the yield curve would have a flatter slope and might even have sloped downward. Indeed, the large-scale repurchases of long-term Treasury bonds (i.e., reductions in supply) by the U.S. Treasury in early 2000 has been viewed as the major cause of the inverted yield curve that appeared in February 2000. More recently, between October 2011 and June 2012 the Federal Reserve conducted its Operation Twist. The program involved the sale of 400 billion of short-term Treasuries in exchange for long-term Treasuries. The program was designed to lower rates on long-term bonds, while keeping short-term interest rates unchanged. By intentionally lowering yields, the Fed was forcing investors to consider other investments that would help the economy more. Many argue that the policy worked. In June 2012, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to a 200-year low. As a result, the housing market and bank lending started to come back.

4. In general, the price and yield on a bond are inversely related. Thus, as the price of a bond falls (becomes cheaper), the demand for the bond will rise. This is the same as saying that as the yield on a bond rises, it becomes cheaper and the demand for it increases.

# FORECASTING INTEREST RATES

LG 2-8

# forward rate

An expected rate (quoted today) on a security that originates at some point in the future.

As will be seen in the time value of money examples in the next section, as interest rates change, so do the values of financial securities. Accordingly, the ability to predict or forecast interest rates is critical to the profitability of financial institutions and individual investors alike. For example, if interest rates rise, the value of investment portfolios of FIs and individuals will fall, resulting in a loss of wealth. Thus, interest rate forecasts are extremely important for the financial wealth of both FIs and individuals. The discussion of the unbiased expectations theory in the previous section of this chapter indicated that the shape of the yield curve is determined by the market's current expectations of future short-term interest rates. For example, an upward-sloping yield curve suggests that the market expects future short-term interest rates to increase. Given that the yield curve represents the market's current expectations of future short-term interest rates, the unbiased expectations theory can be used to forecast (short-term) interest rates in the future (i.e., forward one-year interest rates). A forward rate is an expected or "implied" rate on a short-term security that is to be originated at some point in the future. Using the equations representing the unbiased expectations theory, the market's expectation of forward rates can be derived directly from existing or actual rates on securities currently traded in the spot market. In this section, we use the notation  $f$ , rather than  $E(r)$  used in the previous section, to highlight the terminology "forward rate."

# EXAMPLE 2-4 Calculation of Implied Forward Rates on One-Year Securities Using the Unbiased Expectations Theory

To find an implied forward rate on a one-year security to be issued one year from today, the unbiased expectations theory equation can be rewritten as follows:

$$

{ }_{ 1 } R_{ 2 } = \left[ ( 1 + { }_{ 1 } R_{ 1 } ) ( 1 + { }_{ 2 } f_{ 1 } ) \right]^{ 1 / 2 } - 1

$$ where


$$

{ }_{ 2 } f_{ 1 } = \text{ Ex pe ct ed ~o ne -y ea r ~r at e ~f or ~y ea r ~2 , ~o r ~t he ~i mp li ed ~f or wa rd ~o ne -y ea r ~r at e ~ }

$$

Therefore,  ${}_{2}f_{1}$  is the market's estimate of the expected one-year rate for year 2. Solving for  ${}_{2}f_{1}$ , we get:

$$

{ }_{ 2 } f_{ 1 } = [ ( 1 + { }_{ 1 } R_{ 2 } )^{ 2 } / ( 1 + { }_{ 1 } R_{ 1 } ) ] - 1

$$

In general, we can find the one-year forward rate for any year,  $N$  years into the future, using the following equation:

$$

{ }_{ N } f_{ 1 } = \left[ ( 1 +_{ 1 } R_{ N } )^{ N } / ( 1 +_{ 1 } R_{ N - 1 } )^{ N - 1 } \right] - 1 \tag {2-7}

$$

For example, on September 4, 2019, the existing or current (spot) one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year zero-coupon Treasury security rates were as follows:

$$

{}_{1}R_{1} = 1.698\% ,\quad {}_{1}R_{2} = 1.452\% ,\quad {}_{1}R_{3} = 1.375\% ,\quad {}_{1}R_{4} = 1.359\%

$$

$$

\left._{N - K} f_{K} = \left[ \frac{(1 + R_{N})^{N}}{(1 + R_{N - K})^{N - K}} \right]^{1 / K} - 1 \right.

$$

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

10. What a forward rate is?
11. How an implied forward rate can be obtained from current short- and long-term interest rates?

Note that these rates suggest an inverted yield curve. Using the unbiased expectations theory, one-year forward rates on zero-coupon Treasury bonds for years 2, 3, and 4 as of September 4, 2019, were:

$$

{ }_{ 2 } f_{ 1 } = [ ( 1 . 0 1 4 5 2 )^{ 2 } / ( 1 . 0 1 6 9 8 ) ] - 1 = 1 . 2 0 7 \%

$$

$$

{ }_{ 3 } f_{ 1 } = [ ( 1 . 0 1 3 7 5 )^{ 3 } / ( 1 . 0 1 4 5 2 )^{ 2 } ] - 1 = 1 . 2 2 1 \%

$$

$$

{}_{4}f_{1} = \left[(1.01359)^{4} / (1.01375)^{3}\right] - 1 = 1.311\%

$$

Thus, the expected one-year rate, one year in the future, was 1.207 percent; the expected one-year rate, two years into the future, was 1.221 percent; and the expected one-year rate, three years into the future, was 1.311 percent.

# TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND INTEREST RATES

LG 2-9

So far, we have looked at factors that determine the level of interest rates and at what causes interest rate movements over time. We finish the chapter with a look at the technical details of how interest rates affect the value of financial securities by reviewing time value of money concepts. Time value of money is a crucial tool for much of the analysis in this textbook. For example, interest rates have a direct and immediate effect on the value of virtually all financial securities—that is, interest rates affect the price or value the seller of a security receives and the buyer of a security pays in organized financial markets.

# Time Value of Money

Time value of money is the basic notion that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received at some future date. This is because a dollar received today can be invested and its value enhanced by an interest rate or return such that the investor receives more than a dollar in the future. The interest rate or return reflects the fact that people generally prefer to consume now rather than wait until later. To compensate them for delaying consumption (i.e., saving), they are paid a rate of interest by those who wish to consume more today than their current resources permit (users of funds). Users of funds are willing to pay this rate of interest because they plan to productively use the borrowed funds such that they will earn even more than the rate of interest promised to the savers (suppliers of the funds).

The time value of money concept can be used to convert cash flows earned over an investment horizon into a value at the end of the investment horizon: the investment's future value (FV). Alternatively, the time value of money concept can be used to convert the value of future cash flows into their current or present values (PV) (i.e., future dollars converted into their equivalent present value or current dollars). Two forms of time value of money calculations are commonly used in finance for security valuation purposes: the value of a lump sum and the value of annuity payments. A lump sum payment is a single cash payment received at the beginning or end of some investment horizon (e.g.,  \$100 received at the end of five years). Annuity payments are a series of equal cash flows received at fixed intervals over the entire investment horizon (e.g.,\$ 100 a year received each year for five years). In actual practice, "annuity" payments can be paid more frequently than once a year—so that the term annuity really means a constant payment received at equal intervals throughout an investment horizon (e.g., twice, three times, . . . a year). We first discuss lump sum time value of money calculations, followed by annuity calculations.

# lump sum payment

A single cash flow occurs at the beginning and end of the investment horizon with no other cash flows exchanged.

# annuity

A series of equal cash flows received at fixed intervals over the investment horizon.

# Lump Sum Valuation

Present Value of a Lump Sum. The present value function converts cash flows received over a future investment horizon into an equivalent (present) value as if they were received at the beginning of the current investment horizon. This is done by discounting future cash flows back to the present using the current market interest rate. The present value of an investment is the intrinsic value or price of the investment. The time value of money equation used to calculate this value can be represented as follows.

Present value  $(PV)$  of a lump sum received at the end of the investment horizon, or future value  $(FV)$ :

$$

P V = F V_{t} / (1 + r)^{t} \tag {2-8}

$$ where


$PV =$  Present value of cash flows

$FV_{t} =$  Future value of cash flows (lump sum) received in  $t$  periods

$r =$  Interest rate earned per period on an investment (equals the nominal annual interest rate,  $i$ , divided by the number of compounding periods per year—for example, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually)

$t =$  Number of compounding periods in the investment horizon (equals the number of years in the investment horizon times the number of compounding periods per year)

# CALCULATOR HINTS

$N = 6$

$I = 8$

${FV} = {10},{000}$

${PMT} = 0$

CPT  $PV = -6,301.70$

# EXAMPLE 2-5 Calculation of Present Value of a Lump Sum

You have been offered a security investment such as a bond that will pay you 10,000 at the end of six years in exchange for a fixed payment today. If the appropriate annual interest rate on the investment is 8 percent compounded annually, the present value of this investment is computed as follows:

$$

P V = F V_{t} / (1 + r)^{t} = \ 1 0,0 0 0 / (1 + 0. 0 8)^{6} = \ 1 0,0 0 0 (0. 6 3 0 1 7 0) = \ 6,3 0 1. 7 0

$$

If the annual interest rate on the investment rises to 12 percent, the present value of this investment becomes:

$$

P V = \ 10,000 / (1 + 0.12)^{6} = \ 10,000 (0.506631) = \$ 5,066.31

$$

If the annual interest rate on the investment rises to 16 percent, the present value of this investment becomes:

$$

P V = \$ 10,000 / (1 + 0.16)^{6} = \$ 10,000 (0.410442) = \$ 4,104.42

$$

Finally, if the annual interest rate on the investment of 16 percent is compounded semiannually (that is, you will receive  $t = 12$  ( $= 6 \times 2$ ) total interest payments, each calculated as  $r = 8$  percent ( $= 16$  percent ÷ 2) times the principal value in the investment, where  $r$  in this case is the semiannual interest payment) rather than annually, the present value of this investment becomes:

$$

P V = \ 10,000 / (1 + 0.08)^{12} = \ 10,000 (0.397114) = \ 3,971.14

$$

Notice from the previous examples that the present values of the security investment decrease as interest rates increase. For example, as the interest rate rose from 8 percent to 12 percent, the (present) value of the security investment fell  \$1,235.39 (from\$ 6,301.70 to 5,066.31). As interest rates rose from 12 percent to 16 percent, the value of the investment fell  \$961.89 (from\$ 5,066.31 to 4,104.42). This is because as interest rates increase, fewer funds need to be invested at the beginning of an investment horizon to receive a stated amount at the end of the investment horizon. This inverse relationship between the value of a financial instrument—for example, a bond—and interest rates is one of the most fundamental relationships in finance and is evident in the swings that occur in financial asset prices whenever major changes in interest rates arise.


Note also that as interest rates increase, the present values of the investment decrease at a decreasing rate. The fall in present value is smaller when interest rates rose by 4 percent, from 12 percent to 16 percent, compared to when they rose from 8 percent to 12 percent—the inverse relationship between interest rates and the present value of security investments is neither linear nor proportional.

Finally, from this example notice that the greater the number of compounding periods per year (i.e., semiannually versus annually), the smaller the present value of a future amount.

Future Value of a Lump Sum. The future value of a lump sum equation translates a cash flow received at the beginning of an investment period to a terminal (future) value at the end of an investment horizon (e.g., 5 years, 6 years, 10 years, etc.). The future value  $(FV)$  equation can be represented as follows:

Future value  $(FV)$  of a lump sum received at the beginning of the investment horizon:

# EXAMPLE 2-6 Calculation of Future Value of a Lump Sum

You plan to invest 10,000 today in exchange for a fixed payment at the end of six years. If the appropriate annual interest rate on the investment is 8 percent compounded annually, the future value of this investment is computed as follows:

$$

F V = P V (1 + r)^{t} = \$ 1 0, 0 0 0 (1 + 0. 0 8)^{6} = \$ 1 0, 0 0 0 (1. 5 8 6 8 7 4) = \$ 1 5, 8 6 8. 7 4

$$

If the annual interest rate on the investment rises to 12 percent, the future value of this investment becomes:

$$

F V = \$ 10,000 (1 + 0. 1 2)^{6} = \$ 10,000 (1. 9 7 3 8 2 3) = \$ 1 9, 7 3 8. 2 3

$$

If the annual interest rate on the investment rises to 16 percent, the future value of this investment becomes:

$$

F V = \$ 10,000 (1 + 0. 1 6)^{6} = \$ 1 0,0 0 0 (2. 4 3 6 3 9 6) = \$ 2 4, 3 6 3. 9 6

$$

Finally, if the annual interest rate on the investment of 16 percent is compounded semiannually rather than annually (i.e.,  $r = 16\% / 2 = 8\%$  and  $t = 6 \times 2 = 12$ ), the future value of this investment becomes:

$$

F V = \$ 10,000 (1 + 0. 0 8)^{1 2} = \$ 1 0, 0 0 0 (2. 5 1 8 1 7 0) = \$ 2 5, 1 8 1. 7 0

$$

7. The ultimate of compounding periods is instantaneous, or continuous, compounding over the investment horizon (period). In this case the present value formula becomes:

$$

P V = F V_{t} [ 1 / (1 + r / \infty) ]^{n \infty} = F V_{n} (e^{- r m})

$$ where  $n$  is the number of years in the investment horizon (period). Thus, in Example 2-5, if the annual interest rate on the investment is 16 percent compounded continuously, the present value of the 10,000 investment in six years is:

$$
P V = \$ 10,000 \left(e^{- 0.16 \times 6}\right) = \$ 10,000 (0.382893) = \$ 3,828.93
$$

CALCULATOR HINTS

$N = 6$ $I = 8$ $PV = 10,000$ $PMT = 0$

CPT  $FV = -15,868.74$

Notice that the future value of an investment increases as interest rates increase. As interest rates rose from 8 percent to 12 percent, the (future) value of the investment of  \$10,000 for six years rose by\$ 3,869.49 (from $15,868.74 to $19,738.23). As rates rose from 12 percent to 16 percent, the (future) value of the investment rose  \$4,625.73 (from\$ 19,738.23 to 24,363.96). Note also that as interest rates increase, future values increase at an increasing rate. The increase in future value is smaller when interest rates rose by 4 percent, from 8 percent to 12 percent, compared to when they rose from 12 percent to 16 percent—the positive relationship between interest rates and the future value of security investments is neither linear nor proportional. With the compounding of interest rates, as interest rates increase, a stated amount of funds invested at the beginning of an investment horizon accumulates to an expotentially larger amount at the end of the investment horizon. By contrast, as stated earlier, as interest rates increase, the present value of an investment decreases at a decreasing rate. Finally, notice that as the number of compounding periods per year increases, the future value of a present amount increases.

# Annuity Valuation

Present Value of an Annuity. The present value of an annuity equation converts a finite series of constant (or equal) cash flows received on the last day of equal intervals throughout the investment horizon into an equivalent (present) value as if they were received at the beginning of the investment horizon. The time value of money equation used to calculate this value is represented as follows:

Present value  $(PV)$  of an annuity stream (PMT) received in the future:

$$
P V = P M T \sum_{j = 1}^{t} [ 1 / (1 + r) ]^{j} \tag {2-10}

$$

P V = P M T \times \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{t}}}{r} \right]

\begin{array}{l} P V = P M T \times \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{t}}}{r} \right] \\ = \$ 10,000 \times \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + 0 . 0 8)^{6}}}{0 . 0 8} \right] \\ = \$ 10,000 (4.622880) = \$ 46,228.80 \\ \end{array}

$$

If the investment pays you 10,000 on the last day of every quarter for the next six years (i.e., r = 8\%/4 = 2\% and t = 6 × 4 = 24), the present value of the annuity becomes:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P V = \$ 10,000 \times \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + 0 . 0 2)^{2 4}}}{0 . 0 2} \right] \\ = \$ 10,000 (18.9 1 3 9 2 6) = \$ 1 8 9, 1 3 9. 2 6 \\ \end{array}

$$

If the annuity is paid on the first day of each quarter (referred to as an annuity due), an extra interest payment would be received for each 10,000 payment. Thus, the time value of money equation for the present value of an annuity due becomes:

$$

P V = P M T \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{t}}}{r} \right] (1 + r)

$$

The present value of this investment becomes:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P V = \$ 10,000 \left[ \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + 0 . 0 2)^{2 4}}}{0 . 0 2} \right] (1 + 0. 0 2) \\ = \$ 10,000 (1 8. 9 1 3 9 2 6) (1. 0 2) = \$ 1 9 2, 9 2 2. 0 4 \\ \end{array}

$$

Future Value of an Annuity. The future value of an annuity equation converts a series of equal cash flows received at equal intervals throughout the investment horizon into an equivalent future amount at the end of the investment horizon. The equation used to calculate this value is represented as follows:

Future value  $(FV)$  of an annuity payment stream received over an investment horizon:8

$$

F V_{t} = P M T \sum_{j = 0}^{t - 1} (1 + r)^{j} \tag {2-11}

$$ which can be reduced to the simpler equation:


$$

F V_{t} = P M T \times \left[ \frac{(1 + r)^{t} - 1}{r} \right]

$$

\begin{array}{l} N = 6 \\ I = 8 \\ P V = 0 \\ P M T = 1 0, 0 0 0 \\ C P T F V = - 7 3, 3 5 9. 2 9 \\ \end{array}

$$

# EXAMPLE 2-8 Calculation of the Future Value of an Annuity

You plan to invest 10,000 on the last day of every year for the next six years. If the interest rate on the investment is 8 percent, the future value of your investment in six years is computed as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} F V = \$ 10,000 \left[ \frac{(1 + 0 . 0 8)^{6} - 1}{0 . 0 8} \right] \\ = \$ 10,000 (7.335929) = \$ 73,359.29 \\ \end{array}

$$

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

12. What should happen to the present value of a lump sum cash flow as interest rates increase?
13. What should happen to the future value of an annuity stream of cash flows as interest rates increase?

If the investment pays you \$10,000 on the last day of every quarter for the next six years (i.e.,  $r = 8\% / 4 = 2\%$  and  $t = 6 \times 4 = 24$ ), the future value of the annuity becomes:

$$

\begin{array}{l} F V = \$ 10,000 \left[ \frac{(1 + 0 . 0 2)^{2 4} - 1}{0 . 0 2} \right] \\ = \$ 10,000 (30.421862) = \$ 304,218.62 \\ \end{array}

$$

If the annuity is paid on the first day of each quarter (an annuity due), an extra interest payment would be earned on each 10,000 investment. The time value of money equation for the future value of an annuity due becomes:

$$

F V = P M T \left[ \frac{(1 + r)^{t} - 1}{r} \right] (1 + r)

$$

Thus, the future value of this investment becomes:

$$

\begin{array}{l} F V = \$ 10,000 \left[ \frac{(1 + 0 . 0 2)^{2 4} - 1}{0 . 0 2} \right] (1 + 0. 0 2) \\ = \$ 10,000 (30.421862) (1.02) = \$ 310,303.00 \\ \end{array}

$$

# SUMMARY

This chapter reviewed the determinants of nominal interest rates and their effects on security prices and values in domestic and foreign financial markets. It described the way funds flow through the financial system from lenders to borrowers and how the level of interest rates and its movements over time are determined. The chapter also introduced theories regarding the determination of the shape of the term structure of interest rates.
