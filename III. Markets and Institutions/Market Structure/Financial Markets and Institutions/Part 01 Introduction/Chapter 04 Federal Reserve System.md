# Organization of the Federal Reserve System www.newyorkfed.org

The Federal Reserve System is divided into 12 Federal Reserve districts that are the "operating arms" of the central banking system (see Figure 4-1). Each district has one main Federal Reserve Bank, some of which also have branches in other cities within the district (identified in Figure 4-1). In addition to carrying out the functions for the central banking system as a whole, each Reserve bank acts as a depository institution for the banks in its district. In terms of total assets, the three largest Federal Reserve Banks are the New York, San Francisco, and Richmond banks. As of December 2018, these three banks hold over 74 percent of the total assets (discussed later) of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) is generally considered the most important of the Federal Reserve Banks because so many of the largest U.S. and international banks are located in the New York district. Further, the Federal Reserve's Trading Desk, which (as discussed below) carries out all the open market purchases for the Federal Reserve, is located at the FRBNY.

Federal Reserve Banks operate under the general supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve based in Washington, DC. Each Federal Reserve Bank has its own nine-member board of directors that oversees its operations: six are elected by member banks in the district (three are professional bankers and three are businesspeople) and three are appointed by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors

(directors in this group are prohibited from being employees, officers, or stockholders of a member bank). These nine directors are responsible for appointing the president of their Federal Reserve Bank.

Nationally chartered banks, those chartered by the federal government through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), are required to become members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS). State-chartered banks (those not chartered by the OCC) can also elect to become FRS members if they meet the standards set by the FRS. The primary advantage of FRS membership is direct access to the federal funds wire transfer network for interbank borrowing and lending of reserves (discussed below). Commercial banks that become members of the FRS are required to buy stock in their Federal Reserve district bank. Thus, Federal Reserve Banks are quasipublic (part private, part government) entities owned by member commercial banks in their district. Their stock, however, is not publicly traded and pays a predetermined dividend (at a maximum rate of 6 percent annually). Approximately 38 percent of all U.S. banks are currently members of the Federal Reserve System.

2. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises national banks in the United States to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system (see Chapters 11 and 13).
3. These state-chartered banks are called state-chartered member banks. State-chartered banks that are not members of the FRS are called state-chartered nonmember banks (see Chapter 11).

Federal Reserve Banks operate as nonprofit organizations. They generate income primarily from three sources: (1) interest earned on government securities acquired in the course of Federal Reserve open market transactions (see below), (2) interest earned on reserves that banks are required to deposit at the Fed (see reserve requirements below), and (3) fees from the provision of payment and other services to member depository institutions.

# Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (also called the Federal Reserve Board) is a seven-member board headquartered in Washington, DC. Each member is appointed by the president of the United States and must be confirmed by the Senate. Board members serve a nonrenewable 14-year term. Board members are often individuals with PhD degrees in economics and/or an extensive background in economic research and political service, particularly in the area of banking. Board members' terms are staggered so that one term expires every other January. The president designates two members of the board to be the chair and vice chair for four-year terms. The board usually meets several times per week. As they carry out their duties, members routinely confer with officials of other government agencies, representatives of banking industry groups, officials of central banks of other countries, members of Congress, and academics.

The primary responsibilities of the Federal Reserve Board are the formulation and conduct of monetary policy and the supervision and regulation of banks. All seven board members sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes key decisions affecting the availability of money and credit in the economy (see below). For example, the Federal Reserve Board, through the FOMC, can and usually does set money supply and interest rate targets. The Federal Reserve Board also sets bank reserve requirements (discussed in Chapter 13) and reviews and approves the discount rates (see below) set by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks.

The Federal Reserve Board also has primary responsibility for the supervision and regulation of (1) all bank holding companies (their nonbank subsidiaries and their foreign subsidiaries), (2) state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System (state-chartered member banks), and (3) Edge Act and agreement corporations (through which U.S. banks conduct foreign operations). The Fed also shares supervisory and regulatory responsibilities with state and other federal supervisors (e.g., the OCC, the FDIC), including overseeing both the operations of foreign banking organizations in the United States and the establishment, examination, and termination of branches, commercial lending subsidiaries, and representative offices of foreign banks in the United States. The board approves member bank mergers and acquisitions and specifies permissible nonbank activities of bank holding companies. The board is also responsible for the development and administration of regulations governing the fair provision of consumer credit (e.g., the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act). Finally, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 provided unprecedented powers to the Federal Reserve, putting it in charge of monitoring any of the country's biggest financial firms—those considered critical to the health of the financial system as a whole.

The chair of the Federal Reserve Board, currently Jerome Powell, often advises the president of the United States on economic policy and serves as the spokesperson for the Federal Reserve System in Congress and to the public. All board members share the duties of conferring with officials of other government agencies, representatives of banking industry groups, officials of the central banks of other countries, and members of Congress.

# open market operations

Purchases and sales of U.S. government and federal agency securities by the Federal Reserve.

# Federal Open Market Committee

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the major monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System. As alluded to earlier, the FOMC consists of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the presidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks (on a rotating basis). The chair of the Board of Governors is also the chair of the FOMC. The FOMC is required to meet at least four times each year in Washington, DC. However, eight regularly scheduled meetings have been held each year since 1980.

The main responsibilities of the FOMC are to formulate policies to promote full employment, economic growth, price stability, and a sustainable pattern of international trade. The FOMC seeks to accomplish this by setting guidelines regarding open market operations. Open market operations—the purchase and sale of U.S. government and federal agency securities—is the main policy tool that the Fed uses to achieve its monetary targets (although the operations themselves are normally carried out by traders at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as discussed below). The FOMC also sets ranges for the growth of the monetary aggregates, sets the federal funds rate (see below), and directs operations of the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets (see Chapter 9). In addition, although reserve requirements and the discount rate are not specifically set by the FOMC, their levels are monitored and guided by the FOMC. Associated with each meeting of the FOMC is the release of the Beige Book. The Beige Book summarizes information on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve district. Information included in the Beige Book is drawn from reports from bank directors, interviews with key business leaders, economists, market experts, and other sources. Meetings of the FOMC are some of the most closely watched economic meetings in the world. As the FOMC formulates and implements monetary policy, its actions affect not only the U.S. economy, but economies worldwide.

# Functions Performed by Federal Reserve Banks

As part of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) perform multiple functions. These include assistance in the conduct of monetary policy; supervision and regulation of member banks and other large financial institutions; consumer protection; and the provision of services such as new currency issue, check clearing, wire transfer, and research services to the federal government, member banks, or the general public. We summarize these functions in Table 4-1. The In the News box in this section describes how the Federal Reserve provided extraordinary services in many of these areas in response to the recent financial crisis.

# TABLE 4-1 Functions Performed by the Federal Reserve Banks

Assistance in the conduct of monetary policy—Federal Reserve Bank presidents serve on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). FRBs set and change discount rates.

Supervision and regulation—FRBs have supervisory and regulatory authority over the activities of banks and other large financial institutions located in their district.

Consumer protection and community affairs—FRBs write regulations to implement many of the major consumer protection laws and establish programs to promote community development and fair and impartial access to credit.

Government services—FRBs serve as the commercial bank for the U.S. Treasury.

New currency issue—FRBs are responsible for the collection and replacement of damaged currency from circulation.

Check clearing—FRBs process, route, and transfer funds from one bank to another as checks clear through the Federal Reserve System.

Wire transfer services—FRBs and their member banks are linked electronically through the Federal Reserve Communications System.

Research services—each FRB has a staff of professional economists who gather, analyze, and interpret economic data and developments in the banking sector in their district and economywide.

# The Financial Crisis: Toward an Explanation and Policy Response

In the first half of 2007, as the extent of declining home prices became apparent, banks and other financial market participants started to reassess the value of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities that they owned, especially those in the subprime segment of the housing market. The autumn of 2007 saw increasing strains in a number of market segments, including asset-backed commercial paper, and banks also began to exhibit a reluctance to lend to one another for terms much longer than overnight. This reluctance was reflected in a dramatic rise in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at most maturities greater than overnight. LIBOR is a measure of the rates at which international banks make dollar loans to one another. Since that initial disruption, financial markets have remained in a state of high volatility, with many interest rate spreads at historically high levels.

In response to this turbulence, the Fed and the federal government have taken a series of dramatic steps. As 2007 came to a close, the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation of a Term Auction Facility (TAF), in which fixed amounts of term funds are auctioned to depository institutions against any collateral eligible for discount window loans. So while the TAF substituted an auction mechanism for the usual fixed interest rate, this facility can be seen essentially as an extension of more conventional discount window lending. In March 2008, the New York Fed provided term financing to facilitate the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase through the creation of a facility that took a set of risky assets off the company's balance sheet. That month, the board also announced the creation of the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), swapping Treasury securities on its balance sheet for less liquid private securities held in the private sector, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). These actions, particularly the latter, represented a significant expansion of the federal financial safety net by making available a greater amount of central bank credit, at prices unavailable in the market, to institutions (the primary dealers) beyond those banks that typically borrow at the discount window… .

In the fall of 2008, financial markets worldwide experienced another round of heightened volatility and historic changes: Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection; investment banking companies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley successfully submitted applications to become bank holding companies; Bank of America purchased Merrill Lynch; Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia; PNC Financial Services Group purchased National City Corporation; and the American International Group received significant financial assistance from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. On the policy front, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of several new lending facilities—including the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF), and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), the last of which became operational in March

2009. The TALF was designed to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, while also expanding the TAF and the TSLF. The creation of these programs resulted in a tremendous expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Furthermore, Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to be administered by the Treasury Department. And in February 2009, the president signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a fiscal stimulus program of roughly 789 billion…

Much of the public policy response to turmoil in financial markets over the two years took the form of expanded lending by the Fed and central banks in other countries. The extension of credit to financial institutions has long been one of the tools available to a central bank for managing the supply of money—specifically, bank reserves—to the economy. Indeed, discount window lending by the 12 Reserve Banks was the primary means for affecting the money supply at the time the Fed was created. Over time, open market operations, in which the Fed buys and sells securities in transactions with market participants, have become the main tool for managing the money supply. Lending has become a relatively little-used tool, mainly accessed by banks with occasional unexpected flows into or out of their Fed reserve accounts late in the day. If such banks were to seek funding in the market, they would likely have to pay above-normal rates for a short-term (overnight) loan.

In this way, the discount window became a tool for dampening day-to-day fluctuations in the federal funds rate. In 2006, average weekly lending by the Reserve Banks through the discount window was 59 million.

Since the outset of the widespread market disruptions in the summer of 2007, the Fed has changed the terms of its lending to banks and created new lending facilities. In the first three quarters of 2008, weekly Fed lending averaged  $132.2 billion, and in the fourth quarter of the year, that figure rose to$ 847.8 billion.

Assistance in the Conduct of Monetary Policy. As mentioned, a primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System is to influence the monetary (and financial) conditions in U.S. financial markets and thus the economy. Federal Reserve Banks conduct monetary policy in several ways. For example, as discussed previously, 5 of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents serve on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which determines monetary policy with respect to the open market sale and purchase of government securities and, therefore, interest rates. The Boards of Directors of each Federal Reserve Bank set and change the discount rate (the interest rate on loans made by Federal Reserve Banks to financial institutions). These loans are transacted through each Federal Reserve Bank's discount window and involve the discounting of eligible short-term securities in return for cash loans. Federal Reserve Bank Boards also have discretion in deciding which banks qualify for discount window loans. As discussed above, any discount rate change must be reviewed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. For example, in an attempt to stimulate the U.S. economy and prevent a severe economic recession, the Federal Reserve approved 11 decreases in the discount (and federal funds) rate in 2001.

In the spring of 2008, in an attempt to avoid a deep recession and rescue a failing financial system, the Federal Reserve took a series of unprecedented steps in the conduct of monetary policy. First, Federal Reserve Banks cut interest rates sharply, including one cut on a Sunday night in March 2008 (see below). Second, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York brokered the sale of Bear Stearns, the then fifth-largest investment bank in the United States, to JPMorgan Chase. Without this deal, Bear Stearns was highly likely to fail (and along with it other investment banks in similar situations as Bear Stearns). To get JPMorgan Chase to purchase Bear Stearns, the Fed agreed to take any losses in Bear Stearns's investment portfolio up to  $29 billion. Similarly, in September 2008 AIG (one of the world's largest insurance companies) met with Federal Reserve officials to ask for desperately needed cash. Concerned about how the firm's failure would impact the U.S. financial system, the Federal Reserve agreed to lend$ 40 billion to AIG to prevent its failure. The financial crisis saw the Fed's widening regulatory arm moving beyond depository institutions to other types of financial institutions. Third, for the first time Federal Reserve Banks lent directly to Wall Street investment banks. In the first three days, securities firms borrowed an average of 31.3 billion per day from the Fed.

While the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy is primarily designed to affect the U.S. economy, in our ever increasing global economy, any policy changes made by the Fed also influence, and are influenced by, international developments. For example, as discussed below and in Chapter 9, the Fed's monetary policy actions affect the U.S. dollar for foreign currency exchange rates. A change in the foreign exchange value of the dollar affects the foreign currency price of U.S. goods bought and sold on world markets as well as the dollar price of foreign goods purchased by U.S. citizens. These transactions, in turn, affect output and price levels in the U.S. economy. Therefore, it is essential that the Federal Reserve and the FOMC incorporate information about and analysis of international transactions, movements in foreign exchange rates, and other international developments as well as U.S. domestic influences when formulating appropriate monetary policy.

Supervision and Regulation. Each Federal Reserve Bank has supervisory and regulatory authority over the activities of state-chartered member banks and bank holding companies located in their districts. These activities include (1) the conduct of examinations and inspections of member banks, bank holding companies, and foreign bank offices by teams of bank examiners; (2) the authority to issue warnings (e.g., cease and desist orders should some banking activity be viewed as unsafe or unsound); and (3) the authority to approve various bank and bank holding company applications for expanded activities (e.g., mergers and acquisitions). Further, in the area of bank supervision and regulation, innovations in international banking require continual assessments of, and occasional modifications in, the Federal Reserve's procedures and regulations.

Notably, after March 2008, as the Fed stepped in to save investment bank Bear Stearns from failure, politicians proposed an expanded role for the Fed as the main supervisor for all financial institutions. In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which called for the Fed to supervise the most complex financial companies in the United States and gave regulators (including the Fed) authority to seize and break up any troubled financial firm whose collapse might cause widespread economic damage. Thus, the Fed's supervision and regulation duties have spread to include commercial banks as well as other types of financial institutions.

Consumer Protection and Community Affairs. The U.S. Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve, through FRBs, with the responsibility to implement federal laws intended to protect consumers in credit and other financial transactions. These responsibilities include writing and interpreting regulations to carry out many of the major consumer protection laws, reviewing bank compliance with the regulations, investigating complaints from the public about state member banks' compliance with consumer protection laws, addressing issues of state and federal jurisdiction, testifying before Congress on consumer protection issues, and conducting community development activities. Further, community affairs offices at FRBs engage in a wide variety of activities to help financial institutions, community-based organizations, government entities, and the public understand and address financial services issues that affect lowand moderate-income people and geographic regions.

Government Services. As discussed, the Federal Reserve serves as the commercial bank for the U.S. Treasury (U.S. government). Each year government agencies and departments deposit and withdraw billions of dollars from U.S. Treasury operating accounts held by Federal Reserve Banks. For example, it is the Federal Reserve Banks that receive deposits relating to federal unemployment taxes, individual income taxes withheld by payroll deduction, and so on. Further, some of these deposits are not protected by deposit insurance and must be fully collateralized at all times. It is the Federal Reserve Banks that hold collateral put up by government agencies. Finally, Federal Reserve Banks are responsible for the operation of the U.S. savings bond scheme, the issuance of Treasury securities, and other government-sponsored securities (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac—see Chapter 7). Federal Reserve Banks issue and redeem savings bonds and Treasury securities, deliver government securities to investors, provide for a wire transfer system for these securities (the Fedwire), and make periodic payments of interest and principal on these securities.

New Currency Issue. Federal Reserve Banks are responsible for the collection and replacement of currency (paper and coin) from circulation. They also distribute new currency to meet the public's need for cash. For example, at the end of 1999 the Fed increased the printing of currency to meet the estimated  $697 billion demand for currency resulting from the Y2K scare, in which it was feared that computers worldwide (incapable of recognizing the year 2000) would cease to function on January 1, 2000. Afraid that bank accounts would be lost, depositors withdrew funds in record amounts. More recently, beginning in 2011, there was talk of the Treasury minting a$ 1 trillion platinum coin as a way of addressing the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. A few, otherwise intended, sentences in the 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act allowed such a minting as long as the coin was platinum. Advocates argued that minting the 1 trillion coin to pay off some of the national debt was a better option than the continued fighting by political leaders over raising the U.S. debt ceiling. However, talk of this solution was relatively short-lived, as in January 2013 the Federal Reserve announced that if the Treasury did mint the coin and present it for payment, the Fed would not accept it.

Check Clearing. The Federal Reserve System operates a central check clearing system for U.S. banks, routing interbank checks to depository institutions on which they are written and transferring the appropriate funds from one bank to another. All depository institutions have accounts with the Federal Reserve Bank in their district for this purpose. Table 4-2 shows the number and value of checks collected by the Federal Reserve Banks from 1920 through 2018.

The number of checks cleared through the system peaked in 1990, with 18.60 billion checks cleared. For several reasons, this fell to 4.74 billion by 2018. Industry consolidation and greater use of electronic products has resulted in a reduction in the number of checks written and thus cleared through the Federal Reserve System. Further, in October 2004, the Check 21 Act, enacted by the Congress and the Federal Reserve, allowed banks to destroy checks after taking a digital image that is then processed electronically. The act begins the process of moving to a paperless environment. Check 21 authorizes the use of a substitute check (Image Replacement Document) for settlement. The new law is designed to encourage the adoption of electronic check imaging. It was prompted partly by the September 11 attacks, which grounded the cargo airplanes that flew 42 billion checks a year around the United States, threatening to disrupt the financial system. The switch to electronic processing of checks has saved as much as 3 billion a year for the banking industry. For customers, the implications are mixed. Because checks are processed much more quickly, check writers have lost the "float" of several days between the time checks are deposited and when they are debited from the account.

Wire Transfer Services. The Federal Reserve Banks and their member banks are linked electronically through the Federal Reserve Communications System. This network allows these institutions to transfer funds and securities nationwide in a matter of minutes. Two electronic (wire) transfer systems are operated by the Federal Reserve: Fedwire and the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH). Fedwire is a network linking more than 5,300 domestic banks with the Federal Reserve System (however, use of the Fedwire service is highly concentrated among the top 10 participants in terms of volume). Banks use this network to make deposit

The ACH was developed jointly by the private sector and the Federal Reserve System in the early 1970s and has evolved as a nationwide method to electronically process credit and debit transfers of funds. Table 4-2 shows the number and dollar value of Fedwire and ACH transactions processed by Federal Reserve Banks from 1920 through 2018. In contrast to the falling volume of checks cleared by the Federal Reserve, electronic Fedwire and ACH transactions processed have grown significantly in recent years.

Research Services. Each Federal Reserve Bank has a staff of professional economists who gather, analyze, and interpret economic data and developments in the banking sector as well as the overall economy. These research projects are often used in the conduct of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Research papers are freely accessible to the public, are of very high quality, and are quite readable. This makes them one of the best resources for economists, investors, FI managers, and any other individual interested in the operations and performance of the financial system.

6. A second major wire transfer service is the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). CHIPS operates as a private network, independent of the Federal Reserve. At the core of the CHIPS system are approximately 50 large U.S. and foreign banks acting as correspondent banks for smaller domestic and international banks in clearing mostly international transactions in dollars.

in the Federal Reserve System's balance sheet. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet has expanded and contracted over time. During the 2007-2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, total assets increased significantly from  $951 billion in 2007 to$ 4.5 trillion in 2016, representing 377 percent growth. Then, reflecting the FOMC's balance sheet normalization program that took place between October 2017 and August 2019, total assets declined to  $4.2 trillion in 2018, and$ 3.7 trillion in August 2019. Beginning in September 2019, total assets started to increase.

Liabilities. The major liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet are currency in circulation and reserves (depository institution reserve balances in accounts at Federal Reserve Banks plus vault cash on hand at commercial banks). Their sum is often referred to as the Fed's monetary base or money base. We can represent these as follows:

Reserves—depository institution reserve balances at the Fed plus vault cash.

Money base—currency in circulation plus reserves.

For example, in November 2019 the monetary base totaled  $3.32 trillion, of which$ 1.39 trillion was reserves and 1.93 trillion was currency in circulation. As we show below, changes in these accounts are the major determinants of the size of the nation's money supply—increases (decreases) in either or both of these balances (e.g., currency in circulation or reserves) will lead to an increase (decrease) in the money supply (see below for a definition of the U.S. money supply).

Reserve Deposits. One of the largest liabilities on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet (36.7 percent of total liabilities and equity) is depository institution reserves. All banks hold reserve accounts at their local Federal Reserve Bank. These reserve holdings are used to settle accounts between depository institutions when checks and wire transfers are cleared (see above). Reserve accounts also influence the size of the money supply (as described below).

Total reserves can be classified into two categories: (1) required reserves (reserves that the Fed requires banks to hold by law) and (2) excess reserves (additional reserves over and above required reserves) that banks choose to hold themselves. Required reserves are reserves banks must hold by law to back a portion of their customer transaction accounts (deposits). For example, the Federal Reserve currently requires up to 10 cents of every dollar of transaction deposit accounts at U.S. commercial banks to be backed with reserves (see Chapter 13). Thus, required reserves expand or contract with the level of transaction deposits and with the required reserve ratio set by the Federal Reserve Board. Because these deposits earn little interest, banks try to keep excess reserves to a minimum. Excess reserves, on the other hand, may be lent by banks to other banks that do not have sufficient reserves on hand to meet their required levels.

As the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy, it uses the market for excess reserves. For example, in the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve implemented several measures to provide liquidity to financial markets that had frozen up as a result of the financial crisis. The liquidity facilities introduced by the Federal Reserve in response to the crisis created a large quantity of excess reserves at depository institutions (DIs). Specifically, in October 2008 the Federal Reserve began paying interest on excess reserves for the first time.[7] Further, during the financial crisis, the Fed set the interest rate it paid on excess reserves equal to its target for the federal funds rate (see below). This policy essentially removed the opportunity cost of holding reserves. That is, the interest banks earned by holding excess reserves was approximately equal to what was previously earned by lending to other FIs. As a result, banks drastically increased their holdings of excess reserves at Federal Reserve Banks. Because the U.S. economy was slow to recover from the financial crisis, the Fed kept the fed funds rate at historic lows into 2016. Thus, banks continued to hold large amounts of excess reserves. Note in Table 4-3 that depository institution reserves were 36.7 percent of total liabilities and equity of the Fed in 2018, slightly lower than 37.9 percent in 2008. This in turn was up from 2.2 percent in 2007, prior to the start of the financial crisis.

Some observers claim that the large increase in excess reserves implied that many of the policies introduced by the Federal Reserve in response to the financial crisis were ineffective. Rather than promoting the flow of credit to firms and households, critics argued that the increase in excess reserves indicated that the money lent to banks and other FIs by the Federal Reserve in late 2008 and 2009 was simply sitting idle in banks' reserve accounts. Many asked why banks were choosing to hold so many reserves instead of lending them out, and some claimed that banks' lending of their excess reserves was crucial for resolving the credit crisis. In this case, the Fed's lending policy generated a large quantity of excess reserves without changing banks' incentives to lend to firms and households. Thus, the total level of reserves in the banking system is determined almost entirely by the actions of the central bank and is not necessarily affected by private banks' lending decisions.

Currency Outside Banks. Another large liability, in terms of percentage of total liabilities and equity, of the Federal Reserve System is currency in circulation (38.6 percent of total liabilities and equity in 2018). At the top of each Federal Reserve note ( $1 bill,$ 5 bill, 10 bill, etc.) is the seal of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued it. Federal Reserve notes are basically IOUs from the issuing Federal Reserve Bank to the bearer. In the United States, Federal Reserve notes are recognized as the principal medium of exchange and therefore function as money (see Chapter 1).

Assets. The major assets on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet are Treasury and government agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) securities, Treasury currency, and gold and foreign exchange. While interbank loans (loans to domestic banks) are quite a small portion of the Federal Reserve's assets, they play an important role in implementing monetary policy (see below).

Treasury Securities. Treasury securities (55.2 percent of total assets in 2018) are the largest asset on the Fed's balance sheet. They represent the Fed's holdings of securities issued by the U.S. Treasury (U.S. government). The Fed's open market operations involve the buying and selling of these securities. An increase (decrease) in Treasury securities held by the Fed leads to an increase (decrease) in the money supply.

1. What the main functions of Federal Reserve Banks are?
2. What the main responsibilities of the Federal Reserve Board are?
3. How the FOMC implements monetary policy?
4. What the main assets and liabilities of the Federal Reserve are?

U.S. Government Agency Securities. U.S. government agency securities are the second-largest asset account on the Fed's balance sheet (38.8 percent of total assets in 2018). However, in 2007 this account was 0.0 percent of total assets. This account grew as the Fed took steps to improve credit market liquidity and support the mortgage and housing markets during the financial crisis by buying mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Under the MBS purchase program, the FOMC called for the purchase of up to 1.25 trillion of agency MBS. The purchase activity began on January 5, 2009, and continued through March 2010. Thus, the Fed expanded its role as purchaser/guarantor of assets in the financial markets.

Gold and Foreign Exchange and Treasury Currency. The Federal Reserve holds Treasury gold certificates that are redeemable at the U.S. Treasury for gold. The Fed also holds small amounts of Treasury-issued coinage and foreign-denominated assets to assist in foreign currency transactions or currency swap agreements with the central banks of other nations.

Interbank Loans. As mentioned earlier, depository institutions in need of additional funds can borrow at the Federal Reserve's discount window (discussed in detail below). The interest rate or discount rate charged on these loans is often lower than other interest rates in the short-term money markets (see Chapter 5). As we discuss below, in January 2003 the Fed implemented changes to its discount window lending policy that increased the cost of discount window borrowing but eased the requirements on which depository institutions can borrow. As part of this change, the discount window rate was increased so that it would be higher than the fed funds rate. As a result, (discount) interbank loans are normally a relatively small portion of the Fed's total assets.

Miscellaneous Assets. Generally, miscellaneous assets are a small portion of the Fed's total assets (e.g., 4.0 percent in 2018). However, during the financial crisis, the Fed undertook a number of measures to support various sectors of the financial markets. For example, as mentioned above (and below), during the financial crisis, the Fed provided AIG with a loan to prevent its failure; lent funds (for the first time ever) through its discount window to brokers and dealers; and committed over 1 trillion of loans to support the commercial paper market. These temporary programs were recorded as miscellaneous assets and, as a result, this item rose to 46.7 percent of total assets in 2008.

# MONETARY POLICY TOOLS

LG 4-3

In the previous section of this chapter, we referred briefly to tools or instruments that the Federal Reserve uses to implement its monetary policy. These included open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements. In this section, we explore the tools or instruments used by the Fed to implement its monetary policy strategy. Figure 4-2 illustrates the monetary policy implementation process that we will be discussing in more detail below. Regardless of the tool the Federal Reserve uses to implement monetary policy, the major link by which monetary policy impacts the macroeconomy occurs through the Federal Reserve influencing the market for bank reserves (required and excess reserves held as depository institution reserve balances in accounts at Federal Reserve Banks plus the vault cash on hand of commercial banks). Specifically, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy seeks to influence either the demand for, or supply of, excess reserves at depository institutions and in turn the money supply and the level of interest rates. As we describe in

# fed funds rate

the next section, a change in excess reserves resulting from the implementation of monetary policy triggers a sequence of events that affect such economic factors as short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the amount of money and credit in the economy, and ultimately the levels of employment, output, and prices. Some of the specific economic variables the Federal Reserve works to affect as it implements monetary policy are listed in Table 4-4. These economic variables are referred to as the index of leading indicators. A leading indicator is a measurable economic factor that changes before the economy starts to follow a particular pattern or trend, and, as such, can be used to predict future economic trends.

Depository institutions trade excess reserves held at their local Federal Reserve Banks among themselves. Banks with excess reserves—whose reserves exceed their required reserves—have an incentive to lend these funds (generally overnight) to banks in need of reserves since excess reserves held in the vault or on deposit at the Federal Reserve earn little or no interest. The rate of interest (or price) on these interbank transactions is a benchmark interest rate, called the federal funds rate or fed funds rate, which is used in the United States to guide monetary policy. The fed funds rate is a function of the supply and demand for federal funds among banks and the effects of the Fed's trading through the FOMC.

Further, the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserve balances held by depository institutions effective October 1, 2011. Because of the severity of the financial crisis and the need by the Fed to have as many tools available to fight off the crisis, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 moved the effective date to October 1, 2008. The interest rate on required reserves (IORR) is determined by the Fed and is intended to eliminate effectively the implicit tax that reserve requirements used to impose on depository institutions (see Chapter 13). The interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) is also determined by the board and gives the Federal Reserve an additional tool for the conduct of monetary policy. Specifically, during monetary policy normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to move the federal funds rate into the target range set by the FOMC primarily by adjusting the IOER rate. For example, as indicated in the minutes of the March 2015 FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve intended to set the IOER rate equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate (which was 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent). Thus, as of December 2015, the IOER rate was set at 0.50 percent. As the target range of federal funds rate increased nine times from December 2015 to December 2018, IOER rate was raised nine times from 0.50 percent to 2.40 percent to influence overnight fed funds to trade around the policy target rate or within the target rate range.

In implementing monetary policy, the Federal Reserve can take one of two basic approaches to affect the market for banks' excess reserves: (1) it can target the quantity of reserves in the market based on the FOMC's objectives for the growth in the monetary base (the sum of currency in circulation and reserves) and, in turn, the money supply (see below), or (2) it can target the interest rate on those reserves (the fed funds rate). The actual approach used by the Federal Reserve has varied according to considerations

Consumer sentiment such as the need to combat inflation or the desire to encourage sustainable economic growth (we discuss the various approaches below). Since 1993, the FOMC has implemented monetary policy mainly by targeting interest rates (mainly using the fed funds rate as a target).

As mentioned earlier, to reduce the effects of an economic slowdown in the United States, the Fed decreased the fed funds rate 11 times in 2001. This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the September 2001 terrorist attacks, as well as to combat the perceived risk of deflation. Even into August 2003 the FOMC took the unusual step of foreshadowing its future policy course by announcing that the historically low interest rates could be maintained for a considerable period. Although the FOMC did not specify the length of the considerable period, it was not until the summer of 2004 that the Fed increased the fed funds rate (initially by 0.25 percent). It has been argued that this lowering of interest rates was a contributing factor to the rise in housing prices. From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the fed funds target from 6.5 percent to 1.0 percent. The Fed believed that interest rates could be lowered safely primarily because the rate of inflation was low. However, some have argued that the Fed's interest rate policy during the early 2000s was misguided, because measured inflation in those years was below true inflation, which led to a monetary policy that contributed to the housing bubble. Low interest rates and the increased liquidity provided by the central bank resulted in a rapid expansion in mortgage financing as demand for residential mortgages rose dramatically, especially among those who had previously been excluded from participating in the market because of their poor credit ratings.

The Fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and August 2006; it increased the rate by 0.25 percent for 17 straight meetings. As a result, the fed funds rate rose from a 46-year low of 1 percent in July 2004 to 5.25 percent in August 2006. This contributed to an increase in one-year and five-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates and triggered resets of rates on existing ARMs, making ARM interest payments more expensive for homeowners. This also may have contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates and it became riskier to speculate in housing.

Then, on December 16, 2008, as the U.S. economy faced a severe financial crisis and fell into its deepest recession since the Great Depression, the Fed, in a historic move, unexpectedly announced that it would drop its target fed funds rate to a range between 0 and one-quarter of 1 percent and lowered its discount window rate (see below) to one-half percent, the lowest level since the 1940s (see the In the News box in this section). The overall reduction in the federal funds rate between late 2007 and December 2008 was dramatic, going from 5.26 percent in September 2007 to a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008. The rate remained at these historically low levels into 2010, and in June 2010 the Fed announced that the fed funds rate would remain at these levels for an "extended period." It was not until the spring and summer of 2013 that the Fed mentioned the end of these low interest rates and the tightening of monetary policy. And even then, the Fed repeatedly stated that the end of its monetary easing actions would not come until the very slow economic growth picked up. It was not until December 2015 that the Fed eventually raised interest rates (for the first time in 10 years). Since December 2015, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 percent nine times through December 2018 to reach target fed funds rate of between 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent. During the FOMC meeting that took place on July 31, 2019, the participants favored a reduction in the target range for the fed funds rate due to deceleration in economic activity, concerns about the outlook for inflation, and risks and uncertainties associated with global economic outlook and international trade. As a result, the Fed left the target fed funds rate unchanged but decreased the target range from 2.25–2.50 percent to 2.00–2.25 percent starting from August 1, 2019.

During the early morning hours on September 17, 2019, bids in the fed funds market reached as high as 5 percent, well above the target range of 2.00-2.25 percent. The fed funds rate trading at above the target range has not occurred since the 2008 financial crisis. Similarly, the rate of borrowing money in the repurchase agreement, or, repo, market reached as high as 10 percent, compared with just over 2 percent in the days prior. The spike in

# Fed Cuts Rates to Record Low

In an effort to prevent a worsening recession, in December of 2008 the U.S. Federal Reserve made the unprecedented decision to cut its benchmark interest rates to as low as zero. According to a Fed spokesperson, "The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability." In a historic move, the Fed lowered its target for the benchmark federal funds rates from 1.0 percent to a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent.

The Fed also mentioned that it was considering additional ways to support and boost the faltering economy, including expanding a plan to purchase large amounts of debt issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored mortgage agencies and purchasing longer-term

U.S. Treasury debt. According to the Fed, "The focus of the committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level."

In an article from Reuters, Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York-Mellon in New York, said, "It's a highly unorthodox and creative step. We think it's the best possible move for the U.S. consumer and for the financial market." Even with a large and varied number of new initiatives planned to encourage lending by banks, as of late 2008, U.S. authorities had been unable to stop the recession from worsening. They increased their efforts after the increased economic disruption and confusion that accompanied the failure of Lehman Brothers in September of 2008.

In the fall of 2008, the Fed also injected huge amounts of money into credit markets, increasing the size of its balance sheet from  $887 billion to$ 2.2 trillion over just three months. According to Ian Shephardson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, the decision "is a reflection of an utterly desolate economic picture, which will persist for the foreseeable future as the wrenching adjustment in household finances continues."

overnight lending rates was caused by a string of coincidental events, including corporate tax payments and Treasury sales, according to analysts and investors. But those events only had such startling effect because banks were already operating close to the minimum level of reserves they want to hold. After the 2008 crisis, the Fed's massive bond-buying programs led to a huge increase in reserves in the system. But that has gone into reverse as the central bank tightened monetary policy in the past couple of years. The Fed's reversal has forced the U.S. Treasury to sell more bonds to banks and investors. That reduces the amount of money in the financial system because primary dealers buy the bonds using reserves. The Fed believed there was still spare capacity of  $200 billion to$ 300 billion in reserves before money would get too tight and overnight funding problems would appear, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. However, the combination in of corporate tax payments and Treasury issuance in mid-September showed that cushion may not have existed.

To respond to this crunch in overnight funding markets, the Fed injected billions of dollars into the repo market for the first time in more than a decade. These operations are ongoing, having been both widened in scope, to include two-week lending as well as overnight repo, and increased in size. The Fed is also buying Treasuries again, expanding its balance sheet by an extra 60 billion a month in a bid to build up banks' reserves and increase the amount of cash in the financial system more permanently.

# Open Market Operations

As mentioned earlier, open market operations are the Federal Reserves's purchases or sales of securities in the U.S. Treasury securities market. When a targeted monetary aggregate or interest rate level is determined by the FOMC, it is forwarded to the Federal Reserve Board Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) through a

# policy directive

Statement sent to the Federal Reserve Board Trading Desk from the FOMC that specifies the daily amount of open market purchases or sales to transact.

statement called the policy directive. The manager of the Trading Desk uses the policy directive to instruct traders on the daily amount of open market purchases or sales to transact. These transactions take place on an over-the-counter market in which traders are linked to each other electronically (see Chapter 5).

To determine a day's activity for open market operations, the staff at the FRBNY begins each day with a review of developments in the fed funds market since the previous day and a determination of the actual amount of reserves in the banking system the previous day. The staff also reviews forecasts of short-term factors that may affect the supply and demand of reserves on that day. With this information, the staff decides the level of transactions needed to obtain the desired fed funds rate. The process is completed with a daily conference call to the Monetary Affairs Division at the Board of Governors and one of the four voting Reserve Bank presidents (outside of New York) to discuss the FRBNY plans for the day's open market operations. Once a plan is approved, the Trading Desk is instructed to execute the day's transactions.

Open market operations are particularly important because they are the primary determinant of changes in bank excess reserves in the banking system and thus directly impact the size of the money supply and/or the level of interest rates (e.g., the fed funds rate). When the Federal Reserve purchases securities, it pays for the securities by either writing a check on itself or directly transferring funds (by wire transfer) into the seller's account. Either way, the Fed credits the reserve deposit account of the bank that sells it (the Fed) the securities. This transaction increases the bank's excess reserve levels. When the Fed sells securities, it either collects checks received as payment or receives wire transfers of funds from these agents (such as banks) using funds from their accounts at the Federal Reserve Banks to purchase securities. This reduces the balance of the reserve account of a bank that purchases securities. Thus, when the Federal Reserve sells (purchases) securities in the open market, it decreases (increases) banks' (reserve account) deposits at the Fed.

# EXAMPLE 4-1 Purchases of Securities by the Federal Reserve

Suppose the FOMC instructs the FRBNY Trading Desk to purchase  $500 million of Treasury securities. Traders at the FRBNY call primary government securities dealers of major commercial and investment banks (such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), who provide a list of securities they have available for sale, including the denomination, maturity, and the price on each security. FRBNY traders seek to purchase the target number of securities (at the desired maturities and lowest possible price) until they have purchased the$ 500 million. The FRBNY then notifies its government bond department to receive and pay the sellers for the securities it has purchased. The securities dealer sellers (such as banks) in turn deposit these payments in their accounts held at their local Federal Reserve Bank. As a result of these purchases, the Treasury securities account balance of the Federal Reserve System is increased by $500 million and the total reserve accounts maintained by these banks and dealers at the Fed are increased by $500 million. We illustrate these changes to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in Table 4-5. In addition, there is also an impact on commercial bank balance sheets. Total reserves (assets) of commercial banks will increase by $500 million due to the purchase of securities by the Fed, and demand deposits (liabilities) of the securities dealers (those who sold the securities) at their banks will increase by $500 million. We also show the changes to commercial banks' balance sheets in Table 4-5.

Note the Federal Reserve's purchase of Treasury securities has increased the total supply of bank reserves in the financial system. This in turn increases the ability of banks to make new loans and create new deposits. For example, in March 2009 the Federal Reserve announced that it would buy  $300 billion of long-term Treasury securities over the next six months in order to try and get credit flowing to the financial markets. This program was eventually referred to as the Fed's Quantitative Easing 1 (QE1) program. The Fed generally conducts open market operations using short-term Treasury bills (to set the fed funds rate) and generally does not intervene in long-term Treasury markets (allowing the market to set long-term rates). In fact, the Fed had not purchased long-term Treasury securities since the 1960s. In November 2010, the Fed followed up its QE1 program with QE2, in which it purchased$ 600 billion of long-term Treasury securities between November 2010 and June 2011. In September 2012 the Fed announced the beginning of QE3, an open-ended program involving the purchase of $40 billion of Treasury securities per month. QE3 ended in October 2014. The results of the QE programs can be seen on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in Table 4-3. Treasury securities totaled  $2.46 trillion in 2016, up 232 percent from$ 741 billion in 2007, while depository institution reserves were  $1.98 trillion in 2016, up 9,406 percent from$ 21 billion in 2007. The message to the financial markets from these actions was that the Fed was willing to do whatever was necessary to stabilize the economy until it had sufficiently recovered from the financial crisis. From October 2017 to August 2019, the Fed undertook a balance sheet normalization program, which reduced the Fed's holding of U.S. Treasury securities to  $2.34 trillion in 2018 from2.46 trillion in 2016 (see Figure 4-3).

# EXAMPLE 4-2 Sale of Securities by the Federal Reserve

Suppose the FOMC instructs the FRBNY Trading Desk to sell  $500 million of securities. Traders at the FRBNY call government securities dealers who provide a list of securities they are willing to buy, including the price on each security. FRBNY traders sell securities to these dealers at the highest prices possible until they have sold$ 500 million. The FRBNY then notifies its government bond department to deliver the securities to, and receive payment from, the buying security dealers. The securities dealers pay for these securities by drawing on their deposit accounts at their commercial banks. As a result of this sale, the Treasury securities account balance for the Federal Reserve System is decreased by $500 million (reflecting the sale of $500 million in Treasury securities) and the reserve accounts maintained at the Fed by commercial banks that handle these securities transactions for the dealers are decreased by $500 million. The changes to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in this case would have the opposite sign (negative) as those illustrated in Table 4-5. In addition, total reserves of commercial banks have decreased by $500 million due to the purchase of securities from the Fed, and demand deposits of the securities dealers at their banks have decreased by 500 million (reflecting the payments for the securities by the securities dealers). Commercial banks' balance sheet changes would have the opposite sign as those illustrated in Table 4-5 for a purchase of securities.

Note that the Federal Reserve's sale of Treasury or other government securities has decreased the total supply of bank reserves in the financial system. This in turn decreases the ability of banks to make loans and create new deposits.

While the Federal Reserve conducts most of its open market operations using Treasury securities, other government securities can be used as well. For example, in addition to the purchase of Treasury securities, the QE programs of the Federal Reserve also involved the purchase of 1.25 trillion Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities and bonds between January 2009 and March 2010. The purchase of these securities is evident on the Fed's balance sheet in Table 4-3. In 2016, the Fed's holding of U.S. government agency securities was 1.78 trillion, up from $0 in 2007. As part of the FOMC's balance sheet normalization program that took place between October 2017 and August 2019, the Federal Reserve decreased its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities by reinvesting principal payments received from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in Treasury securities. Notice that, the Fed's holding of U.S. government agency securities was 1.64 trillion in 2018, down from $1.78 trillion in 2016. This is consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. Treasury securities are used most because the secondary market for such securities is highly liquid and there is an established group of primary dealers who also trade extensively in the secondary market. Thus, the Treasury securities market can absorb a large number of buy and sell transactions without experiencing significant price fluctuations.

# Top Four Banks Tap Fed Discount Window

In August of 2007, top banks in the United States, including Citigroup and Bank of America, borrowed 2 billion from the U.S. Federal Reserve. This rare move was designed to stabilize and reassure U.S. markets and change the perceived stigma around receiving assistance from the central bank. Traditionally, borrowing funds from the Fed can be perceived as a sign of financial weakness, but three large banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America, and Wachovia Corp. claim that they made the choice in the interest of helping the financial system. According to Reuters, "All four banks have emphasized that they have access to other, cheaper funds."

After the transactions occurred, U.S. shares rose, though bank stocks' performance continued to be mixed because of persistent concerns about worsening mortgage and mortgage backed securities markets. Nevertheless, the banks' choice to borrow from the Fed signaled credit markets may be starting to heal. Other banks may also start to follow the lead of their larger counterparts. Robert Albertson, chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill in New York, says, "The psychology is, if a bank needs to borrow from the discount window, and they think there's a stigma attached to it, they can say, 'Citi has done it, too."

Traditionally, banks tend to hesitate to borrow funds from the Fed's discount window. In the past, it has been seen as a sign that a bank is in distress. Discount window borrowing also often resulted in additional regulation and oversight. Borrowing from the Fed no longer requires additional federal supervision, but "the stigma remains," according to Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland.

Across the world, central banks are adapting to the financial crisis by pumping liquidity into the global economy. The losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage market continue to make credit difficult to obtain in a range of markets such as commercial paper and junk bonds.

# The Discount Rate

The discount rate is the second monetary policy tool or instrument used by the Federal Reserve to control the level of bank reserves (and thus the money supply or interest rates). As defined previously, the discount rate is the rate of interest Federal Reserve Banks charge on loans to financial institutions in their district. The Federal Reserve can influence the level and price of reserves by changing the discount rate it charges on these loans.

Specifically, changing the discount rate signals to the market and the economy that the Federal Reserve would like to see higher or lower rates in the economy. Thus, the discount rate is like a signal of the FOMC's intentions regarding the tenor of monetary policy. For example, raising the discount rate signals that the Fed would like to see a tightening of monetary conditions and higher interest rates in general (and a relatively lower amount of borrowing). Lowering the discount rate signals a desire to see more expansionary monetary conditions and lower interest rates in general.

For two reasons, the Federal Reserve has rarely used the discount rate as a monetary policy tool. First, it is difficult for the Fed to predict changes in bank discount window borrowing when the discount rate changes. There is no guarantee that banks will borrow more (less) at the discount window in response to a decrease (increase) in the discount rate. Thus, the exact direct effect of a discount rate change on the money supply is often uncertain. The In the News box in this section demonstrates how in August 2007, the Fed's lowering of the discount rate to calm financial markets battered by deteriorating conditions in the mortgage and other debt markets resulted in little effect on the borrowing by banks. However, the Fed's lowering of the fed funds rate less than a month later resulted in a surge in discount window borrowing.

Second, because of its "signaling" importance, a discount rate change often has great effects on the financial markets. For example, the unexpected decrease in the Fed's discount rate (to 0.50 percent) on December 16, 2008, resulted in a 359.61 point increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the largest one-day point gains in the history of the Dow and one of a handful of up days during the height of the financial crisis. Moreover, virtually all interest rates respond in the same direction (if not the same amount) to the discount rate change. For example, Figure 4-4 shows the correlation in four major U.S. interest rates (discount rate, prime rate [the rate banks charge to large corporations for short-term loans], three-month CD rate, and three-month T-bill rate) from January 1999 through November 2019.

In general, discount rate changes are used only when the Fed wants to send a strong message to financial markets to show that it is serious about wanting to implement new monetary policy targets. For example, Federal Reserve Board members commented that the December 16, 2008, discount rate change was taken in light of a deterioration in labor market conditions and a decline in consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production. Further, financial markets remained quite strained and credit conditions tight. The board commented that overall, the outlook for economic activity had weakened further. Thus, this drop in the discount rate was intended to signal the Fed's strong and persistent intention to allow the money supply to increase and to stimulate economic growth. The discount rate stayed at this historical low until February 2010, when the Fed raised the rate to 0.75 percent.

Historically, discount window lending was limited to depository institutions (DIs) with severe liquidity needs. The discount window rate, which was set below the fed funds rate, was charged on loans to depository institutions only under emergency or special liquidity situations (see Figure 4-4, 1999-2019). However, in January 2003 the Fed implemented changes to its discount window lending that increased the cost of borrowing but eased the terms. Specifically, three lending programs are now offered through the Fed's discount window. Primary credit is available to generally sound depository institutions on a very short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate above the Federal Open Market Committee's target rate for federal funds. Primary credit may be used for any purpose, including financing the sale of fed funds. Primary credit may be extended for periods of up to a few weeks to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition that cannot obtain temporary funds in the financial markets at reasonable terms. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It is extended on a very short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate that is above the primary credit rate. Secondary credit is available to meet backup liquidity needs when its use is consistent with a timely return to a reliance on market sources of funding or the orderly resolution of a troubled institution. Secondary credit may not be used to fund an expansion of the borrower's assets. The Federal Reserve's seasonal credit program is designed to assist small depository institutions in managing significant seasonal swings in their loans and deposits. Seasonal credit is available to depository institutions that can demonstrate a clear pattern of recurring intrayearly swings in funding needs. Eligible institutions are usually located in agricultural or tourist areas. Under the seasonal program, borrowers may obtain longer-term funds from the discount window during periods of seasonal need so that they can carry fewer liquid assets during the rest of the year and make more funds available for local lending.

With the change, discount window loans to healthy banks would be priced at 1 percent above the fed funds rate rather than below, as it generally was in the period preceding January 2003. Note in Figure 4-4 the jump in the discount window rate in January 2003. Loans to troubled banks would cost 1.5 percent above the fed funds rate. The changes were intended not to change the Fed's use of the discount window to implement monetary policy, but to significantly increase the discount rate while making it easier to get a discount window loan. By increasing banks' use of the discount window as a source of funding, the Fed hoped to reduce volatility in the fed funds market as well. The change also allowed healthy banks to borrow from the Fed regardless of the availability of private funds. Previously, the Fed required borrowers to prove they could not get funds from the private sector, which put a stigma on discount window borrowing. With the changes, the Fed lends to all banks, but the subsidy of below fed fund rate borrowing is gone.

The Fed took additional unprecedented steps, expanding the usual function of the discount window, to address the financial crisis. While the discount window had traditionally been available only to DIs, in the spring of 2008 (as Bear Stearns nearly failed) investment banks gained access to the discount window through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). In the first three days, securities firms borrowed an average of 31.3 billion per day from the Fed. The largest expansion of the discount window's availability to all FIs occurred in the wake of the Lehman Brothers's failure, as a series of actions were taken in response to the increasingly fragile state of financial markets.

During the financial crisis, the Fed also significantly reduced the spread (premium) between the discount rate and the federal funds target to just one-quarter of a point, bringing the discount rate down to one-half percent. With lower rates at the Fed's discount window and interbank liquidity scarce as many lenders cut back their lending, more financial institutions chose to borrow at the discount window. The magnitude and diversity of nontraditional lending programs and initiatives developed during the crisis were unprecedented in Federal Reserve history. The lending programs were all designed to "unfreeze" and stabilize various parts of the credit markets, with the overall goal that parties receiving credit via these new Fed programs would, in turn, provide funding to creditworthy individuals and firms.

# Reserve Requirements (Reserve Ratios)

The third monetary policy tool available to the Federal Reserve to achieve its monetary targets is depository institution reserve requirements. As defined previously, reserve requirements determine the minimum amount of reserve assets (vault cash plus bank deposits at Federal Reserve Banks) that depository institutions must maintain by law to back transaction deposit accounts (e.g., demand deposits and interest-bearing checking accounts) held as liabilities on their balance sheets. This requirement is usually set as a ratio of transaction accounts—for example, 10 percent (see Chapter 13 for a detailed description of the process used by depository institutions to calculate required reserves). A decrease in the reserve requirement ratio means that depository institutions may hold fewer reserves (vault cash plus reserve deposits at the Fed) against their transaction accounts (deposits). Consequently, they are able to lend out a greater percentage of their deposits, thus increasing credit availability in the economy. As new loans are issued and used to finance consumption and investment expenditures, some of these funds spent will return to depository institutions as new deposits by those receiving them in return for supplying consumer and investment goods to bank borrowers. In turn, these new deposits, after deducting the appropriate reserve requirement, can be used by banks to create additional loans, and so on. This process continues until the banks' deposits have grown sufficiently large such that banks willingly hold their current reserve balances at the new lower reserve ratio. Thus, a decrease in the reserve requirement results in a multiplier increase in the supply of bank deposits and thus the money supply. The multiplier effect can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {C h a n g e i n b a n k d e p o s i t s} = (1 / \text {N e w r e s e r v e r e q u i r m e n t}) \\ \times \text {I n c r e a s e i n r e s e r v e s c r e a t e d b y r e s e r v e r e q u i r m e n t c h a n g e} \\ \end{array}
$$

Conversely, an increase in the reserve requirement ratio means that depository institutions must hold more reserves against the transaction accounts (deposits) on their balance sheet. Consequently, they are able to lend out a smaller percentage of their deposits than before, thus decreasing credit availability and lending, and eventually, leading to a multiple contraction in deposits and a decrease in the money supply. Now the multiplier effect is written as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {C h a n g e i n b a n k d e p o s i t s} = (1 / \text {N e w r e s e r v e r e q u i r e m e n t}) \\ \times \text {D e c r e a s e i n r e s e r v e s c r e a t e d b y r e s e r v e r e q u i r m e n t c h a n g e} \\ \end{array}
$$

# EXAMPLE 4-3 Increasing the Money Supply by Lowering Banks' Reserve Requirements on Transaction Accounts

City Bank currently has  $400 million in transaction deposits on its balance sheet. The current reserve requirement, set by the Federal Reserve, is 10 percent. Thus, City Bank must have reserve assets of at least$ 40 million ( $400 million × 0.10) to back its deposits. In this simple framework, the remaining$ 360 million of deposits can be used to extend loans to borrowers. Table 4-6, Panel A, illustrates the Federal Reserve's and City Bank's balance sheets, assuming City Bank holds all of its reserves at the Fed (i.e., City Bank has no vault cash).

If the Federal Reserve decreases the reserve requirement from 10 percent to 5 percent, City Bank's minimum reserve requirement decreases by  $20 million, from$ 40 million to $20 million ($400 million × 0.05). City Bank can now use $20 million of its reserves at its local Federal Reserve Bank (since these are now excess reserves that earn little interest) to make new loans. Suppose, for simplicity, that City Bank is the only commercial bank (in practice, the multiplier effect described below will work the same except that deposit growth will be spread over a number of banks). Those who borrow the $20 million from the bank will spend the funds on consumption and investment goods and services and those who produce and sell these goods and services will redeposit the $20 million in funds received from their sale at their bank (assumed here to be City Bank). We illustrate this redeposit of funds in Figure 4-5. As a result of these transaction deposits, City Bank's balance sheet changes to $420 million (shown in Panel B of Table 4-6). Because of the 20 million increase in transaction account deposits, City Bank now must increase its reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank by  $1 million ($ 20 million × 0.05) but still has $19 million in excess reserves with which to make more new loans from the additional deposits of $20 million (see row 2 in Figure 4-5).

Assuming City Bank continues to issue new loans and that borrowers continue to spend the funds from their loans, and those receiving the loanable funds (in exchange for the sale of goods and services) redeposit those funds in transaction deposits at City Bank, City Bank's balance sheet will continue to grow until there are no excess reserves held by City Bank (Panel C in Table 4-6). The resulting change in City Bank's deposits will be:

Change in bank deposits = (1 / 0.05)\times (40\mathrm{m} - 20\mathrm{m}) = \ 400\mathrm{m}

For this to happen, City Bank must willingly hold the $40 million it has as reserves. This requires City Bank's balance sheet (and its deposits) to double in size as a result of the reserve requirement decrease from 10 percent to 5 percent (i.e., $800 million deposits × 0.05 = 40 million).

Figure 4-5 Deposit Growth Multiplier

While the deposit multiplier effect has been illustrated here using the example of a change in reserve requirements, it also holds when other monetary policy tools or instruments are changed as well (e.g., open market operations). For example, suppose the FOMC instructs the FRBNY Trading Desk to purchase  $200 million in U.S. Treasury securities. If the reserve requirement is set at 10 percent, the$ 200 million open market purchase will result in an increase in bank reserves of $200 million, and ultimately, via the multiplier (1/0.1), an increase in bank deposits and the money supply of $2 billion:

$$
1 / 0. 1 \times \$ 2 0 0 \text {m i l l o n} = \$ 2, 0 0 0 \text {m i l l o n} = \$ 2 \text {b i l l o n}
$$

We have made some critical assumptions about the behavior of banks and borrowers to simplify our illustration of the impact of a change in open market operations and reserve requirements on bank deposits and the money supply. In Example 4-3 we assume that City Bank is the only bank, that it converts all (100 percent) of its excess reserves into loans, that all (100 percent) of these funds are spent by borrowers, and that all are returned to City Bank as "new" transaction deposits. If these assumptions are relaxed, the overall impact of a decrease in the reserve requirement ratio, or increase in excess reserves from an open market purchase, on the amount of bank deposits and the money supply will be smaller than illustrated, albeit still a multiplier similar to that above, and the precise effect of a change in the reserve base on the money supply is less certain. For example, in Example 4-3, if only 90 percent of any funds lent by City Bank are returned to the bank in the form of transaction deposits and 10 percent is held in cash, then the resulting change in City Bank's deposits will be:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {C h a n g e i n b a n k d e p o s i t s} = [ 1 / (\text {N e w r e s e r v e r e q u i r e m e n t} + \mathrm {c}) ] \\ \times \text {C h a n g e i n r e s e r v e s c r e a t e d b y r e s e r v e r e q u i r m e n t c h a n g e} \\ \end{array}
$$ where  c  is the public's cash-to-deposit ratio or preference for holding cash outside banks relative to bank deposits  = 0.1  (or  10 / 100 ). Thus, City Bank's change in deposits  = [1 / (0.05 + 0.1)] \times (40\mathrm{m} - 20\mathrm{m}) = \ 133.33  million.


# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

5. What the major policy tools used by the Federal Reserve to influence the economy are?
6. What the impact is on credit availability and the money supply if the Federal Reserve purchases securities?
7. Why the Federal Reserve is unique in its ability to change the money supply through monetary policy tools?

Nevertheless, as long as some portion of the excess reserves created by the decrease in the reserve requirement are converted into loans and some portion of these loans after being spent are returned to the banking system in the form of transaction deposits, a decrease in reserve requirements will result in a multiple (that is, greater than one) increase in bank deposits, the money supply, and credit availability.

Conversely, if the Federal Reserve increases reserve requirement ratios, depository institutions must convert some of the loans on their balance sheets back into reserves held at their local Federal Reserve Bank. The overall result is that an increase in the reserve requirements will result in a multiple decline in credit availability, bank deposits, and the money supply (i.e., the multiplier effect described above will be reversed). Again, the overall effect on the money supply is not fully predictable.

Because changes in reserve requirements can result in unpredictable changes in the money supply (depending on the amount of excess reserves held by banks, the willingness of banks to make loans rather than hold other assets such as securities, and the predictability of the public's willingness to redeposit funds lent at banks instead of holding cash—that is, whether they have a stable cash-deposit ratio or not), the reserve requirement is very rarely used by the Federal Reserve as a monetary policy tool.

# THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE MONEY SUPPLY, AND INTEREST RATES

LG 4-4

As we introduced this chapter, we stated that the Federal Reserve takes steps to influence monetary conditions—the money supply, credit availability, interest rates, and ultimately security prices—so it can promote price stability (low inflation) and other macroeconomic objectives. We illustrate this process in Figure 4-6. Historically, the Fed has sought to influence the economy by directly targeting the quantity of bank reserves in the market based on the FOMC's objectives for growth in the monetary base, and in turn the money supply or interest rates. In this section, we take a look at the ultimate impact of monetary policy changes on key economic variables. We also look at the Fed's choice of whether to target the money supply or interest rates in order to best achieve its overall macroeconomic objectives.

Figure 4-6 The Process of Monetary Policy Implementation


# Effects of Monetary Tools on Various Economic Variables

The examples in the previous section illustrated how the Federal Reserve and bank balance sheets change as a result of monetary policy changes. Table 4-7 goes one step further and looks at how the money supply, credit availability, interest rates, and security prices are affected by these monetary policy actions. To do this, we categorize monetary policy tool changes into expansionary activities versus contractionary activities.

Expansionary Activities. We described earlier the three monetary policy tools that the Fed can use to increase the money supply: open market purchases of securities, discount rate decreases, and reserve requirement ratio decreases. All else held constant, when the Federal Reserve purchases securities in the open market, the reserve accounts of banks increase. When the Fed lowers the discount rate, this generally results in a lowering of interest rates in the economy. Finally, a decrease in the reserve requirements, all else constant, results in an increase in bank reserves.

In two of the three cases (open market operations and reserve requirement changes), an increase in reserves results in an increase in bank deposits and the money supply. One immediate effect of this is that interest rates fall and security prices start to rise (see Chapters 2 and 3). In the third case (a discount rate change), the impact of a lowering of interest rates is more direct. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing from banks. Economic agents spend more when they can get cheaper funds. Households, businesses, and governments are more likely to invest in fixed assets (e.g., housing, plant, and equipment). Households increase their purchases of durable goods (e.g., automobiles, appliances). State and local government spending increases (e.g., new road construction, school improvements). Finally, lower domestic interest rates relative to foreign rates can result in a drop in the (foreign) exchange value of the dollar relative to other currencies.[11] As the dollar's (foreign) exchange value drops, U.S. goods become relatively cheaper compared to foreign goods. Eventually, U.S. exports increase. The increase in spending from all of these market participants results in economic expansion, stimulates additional real production, and may cause the inflation rate (defined in Chapter 2) to rise. Ideally, the expansionary policies of the Fed are meant to be conducive to real economic expansion (economic growth, full employment, sustainable international trade) without price

inflation. However, when the Fed undertakes expansionary activities, the resulting increase in demand for goods and services tends to push wages and other costs higher and can lead to inflation. Indeed, price stabilization (low inflation) can be viewed as a primary policy objective of the Fed.

Contractionary Activities. We also described three monetary policy tools that the Fed can use in a contractionary fashion: open market sales of securities, discount rate increases, and reserve requirement ratio increases. All else constant, when the Federal Reserve sells securities in the open market, reserve accounts of banks decrease. When the Fed raises the discount rate, interest rates generally increase in the open market, making borrowing more expensive. Finally, an increase in the reserve requirement ratio, all else constant, results in a decrease in excess reserves for all banks and limits the availability of funds for additional loans.

In all three cases, interest rates will tend to rise. Higher interest rates discourage credit availability and borrowing. Economic participants spend less when funds are expensive. Households, businesses, and governments are less likely to invest in fixed assets. Households decrease their purchases of durable goods. State and local government spending decreases. Finally, an increase in domestic interest rates relative to foreign rates may result in an increase in the (foreign) exchange value (rate) of the dollar. As the dollar's exchange rate increases, U.S. goods become relatively expensive compared to foreign goods. Eventually, U.S. exports decrease.

# Money Supply versus Interest Rate Targeting

Table 4-8 shows how the Federal Reserve has varied between its use of the money supply and interest rates as the target variable used to control economic activity in the United States. Panel a of Figure 4-7 illustrates the targeting of money supply, while Panel b of Figure 4-7 shows the targeting of interest rates. For example, letting the demand curve for money be represented as  $M_D$  in Panel a of Figure 4-7, suppose the FOMC sets the target money supply (currency and bank reserves) at a level that is consistent with 5 percent growth, line  $M_S$  in Panel a of Figure 4-7. At this  $M_S$  level, the FOMC expects the equilibrium interest rate to be  $i^*$ . However, unexpected increases or decreases in production, or changes in inflation, may cause the demand curve for money to shift up and to the right,  $M_D'$ , or down and to the left,  $M_D''$ . Accordingly, interest rates will fluctuate between  $i'$  and  $i''$ . Thus, targeting the money supply can lead to periods of relatively high volatility in interest rates.

In Panel b of Figure 4-7, suppose instead the FOMC targets the interest rate,  $i_{T} = 6$  percent. If the demand for money falls, to  $M_{D}^{\prime \prime}$ , interest rates will fall to  $i^{\prime \prime} = 5$  percent with no intervention by the Fed. In order to maintain the target interest rate, the FOMC has to conduct monetary policy actions (such as open market sales of U.S. securities) to lower bank reserves and the money supply (to  $M_{S}^{\prime}$ ). This reduction in the money supply will maintain the target interest rate at  $i_{T} = 6$  percent. As should be obvious from these graphs and the discussion, the Federal Reserve can successfully target only one of these two variables (money supply or interest rates) at any one moment. If the money supply is the target variable used to implement monetary policy, interest rates must be allowed to fluctuate relatively freely. By contrast, if an interest rate (such as the fed funds rate) is the target, then bank reserves and the money supply must be allowed to fluctuate relatively freely.

In the 1970s, the Fed, and then chairs Arthur Burns and G. William Miller, implemented its monetary policy strategy by targeting the federal funds rate. However, during the 1970s interest rates rose dramatically (Figure 4-8). The Fed responded to these interest rate increases by increasing the money supply, which led to historically high levels of inflation (e.g., over 10 percent in the summer of 1979). With rapidly rising inflation, Paul Volcker (chair of the Federal Reserve Board from 1979 to 1987) felt that interest rate targets were not doing an appropriate job in constraining the demand for money (and the inflationary side of the economy). Thus, on October 6, 1979, the Fed chose to completely refocus its monetary policy, moving away from interest rate targets toward targeting the money supply itself, and in particular bank reserves—so-called nonborrowed reserves, which are the difference between total reserves and reserves borrowed through the discount window (see the earlier discussion in this chapter).

Growth in the money supply, however, did not turn out to be any easier to control. For example, the Fed missed its money supply growth rate targets in each of the first three years in which reserve targeting was used. Further, in contrast to expectations, volatility

in the money supply growth rate grew as well (Figure 4-8). Thus, in October 1982, the Federal Reserve abandoned its policy of targeting nonborrowed reserves for a policy of targeting borrowed reserves (those reserves banks borrow from the Fed's discount window).

The borrowed reserve targeting system lasted from October 1982 until 1993, when the Federal Reserve, and then chair Alan Greenspan, announced that it would no longer target bank reserves and money supply growth at all. At this time, the Fed announced that it would use interest rates—the federal funds rate—as the main target variable to conduct monetary policy (initially setting the target rate at a constant 3 percent). A guiding principle used by the Fed to set short-term interest rates during this period is the Taylor rule, a formula developed by economist John Taylor. The rule states that short-term interest rates should be determined by three conditions: (1) where actual inflation is relative to the Fed's targeted level, (2) the extent to which the economy is above or below its full employment level, and (3) what short-term interest rates should be to achieve full employment. The rule recommends that the Fed increase interest rates when inflation is above its target or when the economy is above the full employment level and decrease interest rates when inflation is below its target or when the economy is below the full employment level. Although the Fed does not follow the Taylor rule unequivocally in conducting monetary policy, the rule closely describes how monetary policy actually has been conducted since 1993.

Under the current regime, and contrary to previous tradition such as in the 1970s, the Fed simply announces whether the federal funds rate target has been increased, decreased, or left unchanged after every monthly FOMC meeting—previously, the federal funds rate change had been kept secret. This announcement is watched very closely by financial market participants who react quickly to any change in the fed funds rate target. As a result of this regime, there has been relatively small volatility in interest rates since the late 1980s (see Figure 4-8).

In addition, following its meeting in January 2012, the FOMC issued a statement announcing that it would adopt a strategy of inflation targeting. The FOMC noted in its statement that inflation at the rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the

# Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee

At the December 2019 FOMC meeting, participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) would be at or some-what above their individual estimates of the longer-run growth rate in 2019 and 2020 and would converge toward the longer-run rate in 2021 (see table). All participants projected that by the end of the current year, the unemployment rate would be below their individual estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate—that is, their projected unemployment gaps would be negative—and that these negative gaps would persist through 2022, even though many participants reduced their estimates of the


longer-run normal rate. All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would remain low in 2019. Participants generally projected inflation to be either at or just slightly below the committee's 2 percent objective in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. By communicating an inflation goal the Fed hoped to clearly keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the FOMC's ability to promote maximum employment.

Finally, in 2013 the Fed altered the purpose of its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Historically, the SEP contained information on FOMC meeting participants' forecasts of the unemployment rate, the change in real GDP, inflation, and core inflation rate at different points in time under appropriate monetary policy. However, since January 2012 the Fed started to disclose its members' views on the future path of the target interest rate under appropriate monetary policy as well. For example, in conjunction with the FOMC meeting held on December 11, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run. The In the News Box shows the SEP for December 11, 2019. Each participant's projection is based on information available at the time of the meeting together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under "appropriate monetary policy" and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Appropriate monetary policy is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.

# INTERNATIONAL MONETARY POLICIES AND STRATEGIES

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/8d04a5ac-85cd-4263-9695-9d761733496f/9877b73608f0e3a51d4601f6a084b782ede5fceb909489fa4f574d3043023f28.jpg)

Central banks guide the monetary policy in virtually all countries. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) is the central bank for the European Union, while the Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom. Like the Federal Reserve, these are independent central banks whose decisions do not need to be ratified by the government. In contrast, the People's Bank of China, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil are less independent in that the government imposes direct political control over the operations of these central banks. Independence of a central bank generally means that the bank is free from pressure from politicians who may attempt to enhance economic activity in the short term (e.g., around election time) at the expense of long-term economic growth. Therefore, independent central banks operate with more credibility.

Regardless of their independence, in the increasingly global economy, central banks around the world must work not only to guide the monetary policy of their individual countries, but also to coordinate their efforts with those of other central banks. In this section, we look at how central banks around the world took independent as well as coordinated actions as they set their monetary policy during the financial crisis. For example, as news spread that Lehman Brothers would not survive, FIs around the world moved to disentangle trades made with Lehman. The Dow fell more than 500 points, the largest drop in over seven years. By Wednesday, September 17, 2008, tension had mounted around the world. Stock markets saw huge swings in value as investors tried to sort out who might survive (markets from Russia to Europe were forced to suspend trading as stock prices plunged).

As the U.S. government debated a rescue plan, the financial crisis continued to spread worldwide. During the last week of September and the first week of October 2008, the German government guaranteed all consumer bank deposits and arranged a bailout of Hypo Real Estate, the country's second-largest commercial property lender. The United Kingdom nationalized mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley (the country's eighth-largest mortgage lender) and raised deposit guarantees from  $62,220 to$ 88,890 per account. Ireland guaranteed the deposits and debt of its six major financial institutions. Iceland rescued its third-largest bank with an $860 million purchase of 75 percent of the bank's stock and a few days later seized the country's entire banking system. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg central governments together agreed to inject $16.37 billion into Fortis NV (Europe's first ever cross-border financial services company) to keep it afloat. However, five days later this deal fell apart and the bank was split up. The Dutch government bought all assets located in the Netherlands for approximately $23 billion. The central bank in India stepped in to stop a run on the country's second-largest bank, ICICI Bank, by promising to pump in cash. Central banks in Asia injected cash into their banking systems as banks' reluctance to lend to each other and a run on Bank of East Asia Ltd. led the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to inject liquidity into its banking system. South Korean authorities offered loans and debt guarantees to help small and midsized businesses with short-term funding. Table 4-9 lists some other systemwide support programs (e.g., on October 12, Australia committed an unspecified amount of funds to guarantee the country's bank liabilities) and bank-specific actions (e.g., on September 30, the ECB and the French government pledged $3 billion to recapitalize Dexia, one of France's largest banks) taken by central governments during the heat of the crisis. All of these actions were a result of the spread of the U.S. financial market crisis to world financial markets.

# Systemwide Rescue Programs Employed during the Financial Crisis

While the previously mentioned actions by central banks represent steps taken by individual countries, they were just part of a coordinated effort by major countries to ease the monetary conditions brought about by the financial crisis and avoid a deep worldwide recession. At the heart of the efforts were 11 countries, which accounted for the bulk of the rescue programs: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The central banks in these countries took substantive actions targeted at the balance sheets of financial institutions in their countries.

The programs can be categorized into four general areas: expansion of retail deposit insurance, capital injections, debt guarantees, and asset purchases/guarantees.[12] Figure 4-9 summarizes deposit insurance coverage in various countries before versus after the start of the financial crisis, and Table 4-10 provides a more detailed overview of the commitments and outlays associated with capital injections, debt guarantees, and asset purchases/guarantees made by various countries.


Expansion of Retail Deposit Insurance. Increased retail bank deposit insurance coverage was widely used during the crisis to ensure continued access to deposit funding. As shown in Figure 4-9, the amounts covered by deposit insurance varied substantially across countries, with some countries extending unlimited guarantees of retail deposits.

Capital Injections. Direct injections of capital by central governments were the main mechanism used to directly support bank balance sheets. Governments increased banks' capital by injecting combinations of common shares, preferred shares, warrants, subordinated debt, mandatory convertible notes, or silent participations. These capital injections improved banks' abilities to absorb additional losses and strengthened protection for banks' uninsured creditors. Further, because they relieved balance sheet constraints, the capital injections allowed banks to increase their lending.

Countries varied in the capital instruments they used and the conditions of their capital injections. Some countries (e.g., the United States) also imposed restrictions on executive compensation and/or dividend payments to common stockholders. As seen in Table 4-10, countries also varied in the amounts of capital injected into the banking system. The Netherlands made commitments totaling 6.2 percent of the country's GDP, the United Kingdom made commitments worth 3.4 percent of its GDP, and Switzerland made commitments worth 1.1 percent of its GDP.

Debt Guarantees. As financial markets froze, so did the wholesale funding market used by banks to support lending activities. In response to these events, governments announced state guarantees on bank wholesale debt. Specifically, governments provided explicit guarantees against default on uninsured bank liabilities. These programs allowed banks to maintain access to reasonably priced, medium-term funding. They also reduced liquidity risk and lowered overall borrowing costs for banks.

Countries varied in the range of liabilities covered and the fee structures associated with these programs (e.g., some charged a flat fee, while others linked fees to bank credit default swap spreads). Further, as seen in Table 4-10, countries committed significantly larger amounts to the debt guarantee programs than to the capital injection programs. Many countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Italy, and Switzerland) committed unspecified amounts for debt guarantees, the Netherlands committed an amount totaling 33.6 percent of the country's GDP, the United Kingdom made commitments worth 17.2 percent of its GDP, and Spain made commitments worth 9.1 percent of its GDP.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

11. The monetary policy measures taken by central banks to address the recent worldwide financial crisis? What were they?

Asset Purchases or Guarantees. Asset purchase programs removed distressed assets from bank balance sheets. Thus, bank liquidity was improved and capital relief was provided (particularly if purchase prices were higher than book values). Asset guarantee programs left the distressed assets with the banks. However, the central banks assumed part or all of the risk of the portfolio of distressed or illiquid assets from the banks. Asset purchase and guarantee programs were not used extensively. A main reason for this is that it was difficult to determine the price at which the central bank would purchase the distressed assets. A purchase price set too close to par effectively amounted to a covert recapitalization of the bank. Further, there was a debate regarding the range of eligible assets. To have a significant and immediate impact on market confidence, the programs would have to cover all distressed assets, which would require large programs. As seen in Table 4-10, the United Kingdom used asset guarantees extensively (commitments amounted to 33.4 percent of the country's GDP). Beyond this, Germany committed an unspecified amount for asset purchases and an amount totaling 8.0 percent of the country's GDP for asset guarantees, while the United States committed 1.0 percent of its GDP for asset purchases and an amount totaling 2.5 percent of the country's GDP for asset guarantees.

# Challenges Remain after the Crisis

While the worst of the financial crisis subsided in the United States in the last half of 2009, throughout the spring of 2010 Greece struggled with a severe debt crisis. Early on, the European Central Bank (ECB) and some of the healthier European countries tried to step in and assist the debt-ridden country. Specifically, in March 2010 the ECB, Germany, and France began formulating a plan to bail out Greece with as much as 41 billion in aid. However, in late April, Greek bond prices dropped dramatically as traders determined that a debt default was inevitable, even if the country received a massive bailout. The selloff was the result of still more bad news for Greece, which showed that the 2009 budget deficit was worse than had been previously reported. As a result, politicians in Germany began to voice opposition to a Greek bailout. Further, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Greece's debt rating and warned that additional cuts could be on the way. However, the ECB stated that it would continue to support Greece regardless of the country's credit rating.

The problems in the Greek bond market then spread to other European nations with fiscal problems, such as Portugal, Spain, and Italy. As a result, in May the ECB, euro-zone countries, and the International Monetary Fund, seeking to halt a widening European debt crisis that had now threatened the stability of the euro, agreed to extend to Greece an unprecedented $147 billion rescue in return for huge budget cuts. Additional rescue packages and promises of further austerity measures intended to cut the burgeoning Greek deficit occurred through 2012. Yet the European debt crisis continued. While Greece had not yet missed a bond payment, in March the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) $^{13}$  declared that Greece had undergone a "restructuring credit event" which triggered insurance policy payments. The restructuring event was a forced swap of old debt held by some of its private bond holders for new debt. The swap forced a 74 percent haircut on those creditors that held out, triggering the effective default.

At one point, Greece seemed unable to form a government and the leader of one party rejected the country's bailout commitments. It seemed increasingly conceivable that Greece might have to leave the euro zone. Economists estimated that a Greek exit from the euro zone would cost the European Union $1 trillion, or about 5 percent of the Union's annual economic output. Yet, the leaders of EU countries, particularly Germany and France, continued to work to keep Greek reform on track and the EU together. Further, the ECB stated that it would do whatever it took to protect the euro; the ECB prepared to move forcefully into bond markets in tandem with Europe's rescue funds and concentrated on buying shorter-term debt. Through June 2012, the cost of bailouts required to do so totaled over $480 billion and, while calmer, the crisis in the EU was not over as Spain and Italy required bailouts as well. Fear arose that, in their efforts to keep the European Union together and the euro intact, sound countries would be drawn into their own crises as they were called upon to bail out unhealthy countries.

The situation in Greece and the European Union stabilized after 2012. However, a major debt payment was due from Greece to its creditors on June 30, 2015, a payment required to continue to receive rescue funds from the EU. Knowing that they could not make the payment, Greek officials met with euro-zone leaders in an attempt to get a better deal. Greece, however, was unwilling to agree to more spending cuts and other concessions requested by the EU and talks broke down. Greece would be the first developed country to default on its debt and faced the real possibility that it would be forced to leave the European Union. With its financial system near collapse and a debt payment due to the ECB on July 20, Greece was forced to continue negotiations with its creditors. In August 2015, Greece and its EU creditors agreed on a third bailout worth  $94 billion, imposing further budget cuts on the country to avoid bankruptcy and exit from the euro zone. Finally, in August 2018, Greece exited the third bailout program. In total, Greece now owes the EU and IMF roughly$ 330 billion, part of a public debt that has climbed to 180 percent of GDP. A sign of investor optimism about the country's economy is evident as the yield on the Greek 10-year note continues to fall. While the yield peaked in February 2012 at 34.33 percent, it is currently at 1.34 percent (as of October 2019).


Underscoring both the importance and limits of monetary policy in a global economy, in the mid-2010s, beleaguered by painfully slow growth and anxious financial markets well after the financial crisis that began in 2008, central banks around the world went to new lengths to boost their economies. For example, in early 2016 the Bank of Japan (BOJ) set its key short-term interest rate below zero. Specifically, the BOJ charged a 0.10 percentage point penalty on excess reserves that banks keep on deposit at the BOJ. In theory, the increasingly radical steps would encourage Japan's commercial banks to circulate more money in the economy, where it can be used for investment and growth. The move followed three years of aggressive monetary easing by the BOJ, in which the central bank purchased ¥80 trillion (660.8 billion) in government bonds a year, an amount equal to one-fifth of the size of Japan's economy. As a result, as of December 10, 2019, the BOJ held a total of 581.2 trillion yen in assets. Its Japanese government bond holding was 480.9 trillion yen, up by 20.1 trillion yen from December 10, 2018. The danger in all this is that it has extended the bank's balance sheet to potentially dangerous levels. Its assets and liabilities are 2.5 times larger than when the BOJ governor Kuroda came into office in 2013 and are larger than the entire Japanese economy.

The ECB set negative interest rates on some bank reserves in 2014, and by 2019, it has aggressively gone back to the policy. In September 2019, the ECB decided to lower its deposit rate to -0.5 percent, although it did take steps to protect some deposits against this new low rate. Globally, negative yielding debt hit a record of 17 trillion in August 2019, according to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Negative Yielding Debt Index. It has since pulled back from that peak but still represents an estimated 15 to 25 percent of the entire global bond market.

Challenges to central banks became even bigger in June 2016 when the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU after 43 years (Brexit). The shock from the UK's surprise vote to leave the EU swept across global markets, triggering steep drops in stock markets and the British pound, and a flight into safe assets such as U.S. bonds and gold. The pound fell more than 11 percent to its lowest point since 1985. The DJIA dropped 610.32 points, or 3.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 7 percent, its steepest drop since 2008, while Japan's Nikkei Stock Average declined 7.9 percent. Bonds also sold off sharply, pushing UK government borrowing costs sharply higher as traders and investors grappled with the market implications of Brexit. The UK had its credit rating outlook cut to "negative" by the ratings agency Moody's. Less than an hour after the markets opened in London, the governor of the Bank of England stood in front of television cameras to announce that the central bank had earmarked £250 billion (about 344 billion) to release as needed for stability. The Bank of England faces an extraordinarily tricky situation as it attempts to navigate Brexit. It simultaneously must plan for a possible recession caused by Brexit uncertainty and for higher inflation because of the drop in the currency value and outflow of capital.

In response to the Brexit vote, the Bank of England (BoE) unveiled a four-point plan to prevent a post-Brexit recession. In August 2016, the BoE cut interest rates for the first time in more than seven years to a new record low of 0.25 percent. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, took a tough line with commercial banks, telling them they had no excuse not to pass the lower official borrowing costs onto customers. As part of a four-point package, Carney unveiled additional funds for banks to cushion the blow to their profitability from lower interest rates, pumped an additional 60 billion pounds in electronic cash into the economy to buy government bonds (extending the existing quantitative easing program to 435 billion pounds in total), and announced another 10 billion pounds in cash to buy corporate bonds from firms making a material contribution to the UK economy. Carney has recently pointed out the limits to what central banks can do. "In the end, monetary policy can only help smooth the adjustment to the major real shock that an abrupt nodule Brexit would entail," Carney said in a speech at a meeting of central bankers at the end of August 2019.

# DEFINITION OF MONEY MARKETS: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

In money markets, short-term debt instruments (those with an original maturity of one year or less) are issued by economic agents that require short-term funds (e.g., corporations that need to purchase inventory for increased production in September, the sales of which will not occur until December) and are purchased by economic agents that have excess short-term funds (e.g., individuals who receive a paycheck yet have few bills due for two months). Once issued, money market instruments trade in active secondary markets. Capital markets serve a similar function for market participants with excess funds to invest for periods of time longer than one year and/or who wish to borrow for periods longer than one year. Market participants who concentrate their investments in capital market instruments also tend to invest in some money market securities so as to meet their short-term liquidity needs. The secondary markets for money market instruments are extremely important, as they serve to reallocate the (relatively) fixed amounts of liquid funds available in the market at any particular time.

Money markets played a major role in the financial crisis of 2008-2009. As mortgage and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets started to experience large losses, money markets froze and banks stopped lending to each other at anything but high overnight rates. The overnight London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR, a benchmark rate that reflects the rate at which banks lend to one another) more than doubled, rising from 2.57 percent on September 29, 2008, to an all-time high of 6.88 percent on September 30, 2008. Further, commercial paper markets, short-term debt used to finance companies' day-to-day operations, shrank by  $52.1 billion (from$ 1.7 trillion in size) in less than a one-week period in mid-September 2008.
