# Money Markets

Markets that trade debt securities or instruments with maturities of less than one year.

In this chapter, we present an overview of money markets. We define and review the various money market instruments that exist, the new issue and secondary market trading process for each, and the market participants trading these securities. We also look at international money markets and instruments, taking a particularly close look at the Euro markets.

## Money Markets

LG 5-1

# opportunity cost

The forgone interest cost from the holding of cash balances when they are received.

# default risk

The risk of late or nonpayment of principal or interest.

## Do You Understand?

1. What the three characteristics common to money market securities are?
2. Why it is difficult for individual investors to be involved in the initial sale of a money market security?

The need for money markets arises because the immediate cash needs of individuals, corporations, and governments do not necessarily coincide with their receipts of cash. For example, the federal government collects taxes quarterly. However, its operating and other expenses occur daily. Similarly, corporations' daily patterns of receipts from sales do not necessarily occur with the same pattern as their daily expenses (e.g., wages and other disbursements). Because excessive holdings of cash balances involve a cost in the form of forgone interest, called opportunity cost, those economic units with excess cash usually keep such balances to the minimum needed to meet their day-to-day transaction requirements. Consequently, holders of cash invest "excess" cash funds in financial securities that can be quickly and relatively costlessly converted back to cash when needed with little risk of loss of value over the short investment horizon. Money markets are efficient in performing this service in that they enable large amounts of money to be transferred from suppliers of funds to users of funds for short periods of time both quickly and at low cost to the transacting parties. A money market instrument provides an investment opportunity that generates a higher rate of interest (return) than holding cash (which yields zero interest), but it is also very liquid and (because of its short maturity) has relatively low default risk.

Notice, from the description above, that money markets and money market securities or instruments have three basic characteristics. First, money market instruments are generally sold in large denominations (often in units of $1 million to $10 million). Most money market participants want or need to borrow large amounts of cash, so that transactions costs are low relative to the interest paid. The size of these initial transactions prohibits most individual investors from investing directly in money market securities. Rather, individuals generally invest in money market securities indirectly, with the help of financial institutions such as money market mutual funds.

Second, money market instruments have low default risk; the risk of late or nonpayment of principal and/or interest is generally small. Since cash lent in the money markets must be available for a quick return to the lender, money market instruments can generally be issued only by high-quality borrowers with little risk of default.

Finally, money market securities must have an original maturity of one year or less. Recall from Chapter 3 that the longer the maturity of a debt security, the greater is its interest rate risk and the higher is its required rate of return. Given that adverse price movements resulting from interest rate changes are smaller for short-term securities, the short-term maturity of money market instruments helps lower the risk that interest rate changes will significantly affect the security's market value and price.

## Yields on Money Market Securities

For many of the money market securities discussed below, returns are measured and quoted in a manner that does not allow them to be evaluated using the time value of money equations. For example, some securities interest rates or returns are based on a 360-day year, while others are based on a 365-day year. It is therefore inappropriate to compare annual interest rates on the various money market securities as well as on short-term and long-term securities without adjusting their interest rates for differences in the securities' characteristics.

### Bond Equivalent Yields

The bond equivalent yield, $i_{be}$, is the quoted nominal, or stated, yield on a security. From Chapters 2 and 3, the bond equivalent yield is the rate used to calculate the present value of an investment. For money market securities, the bond equivalent yield is the product of the periodic rate and the number of periods in a year. It is calculated as follows:

$$
i_{be} = \left[ \frac{(P_f - P_0)}{P_0} \right] \times \frac{365}{n}
$$ where

$$
\begin{array}{l}
P_f = \text{Face value} \\
P_0 = \text{Purchase price of the security}
\end{array}
$$

$n$ = Number of days until maturity

### Effective Annual Return

The bond equivalent yield is a quoted nominal or stated rate earned on an investment over a one-year period. The bond equivalent yield does not consider the effects of compounding of interest during a less than one year investment horizon. If interest is paid or compounded more than once per year, the true annual rate earned is the effective annual return on an investment. The bond equivalent yield on money market securities with a maturity of less than one year can be converted to an effective annual interest return (EAR) using the following equation:

$$
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{i_{be}}{365/n}\right)^{365/n} - 1
$$

**Example 5-1 Calculation of EAR on a Money Market Security**

Suppose you can invest in a money market security that matures in 75 days and offers a 3 percent nominal annual interest rate (i.e., bond equivalent yield). The effective annual interest return on this security is:

$$

EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.03}{365 / 75}\right)^{365 / 75} - 1 = 3.036\%

$$

### Discount Yields

Some money market instruments (e.g., Treasury bills and commercial paper) are bought and sold on a discount basis. That is, instead of directly received interest payments over the investment horizon, the return on these securities results from the purchase of the security at a discount from its face value  $(P_0)$  and the receipt of face value  $(P_f)$  at maturity, as we show in the following time line.

$$

\begin{array}{c} P_{0} \hskip 1 4. 2 2 6 3 7 8 p t P_{f} \\ 0 \hskip 1 4. 2 2 6 3 7 8 p t \text{Ma tu ri ty} \\ \text{(da ys)} \end{array}

$$

Further, yields on these securities use a 360-day year rather than a 365-day year. Interest rates on discount securities, or discount yields  $(i_d)$ , are quoted on a discount basis using the following equation:

$$ i_d = \frac{P_f - P_0}{P_f} \times \frac{360}{n} $$

There are several features of a discount yield that make it difficult to compare with bond equivalent yields on other (nondiscount) securities—for example, U.S. Treasury bonds. Notice the discount yield uses the terminal price, or the security's face value  $(P_f)$ , as the base price in calculating an annualized interest rate. By contrast, bond equivalent yields are based on the purchase price  $(P_0)$  of a security. Further, and as already mentioned, discount yields generally use a 360-day rather than a 365-day year to compute interest returns. Prior to the advent of calculators and computers, it was quicker and easier for investors and traders to compute discount yields using a 360-day year. Similarly, manual calculations of discount yields were simpler using the face value (a nice round number) as the base number rather than the purchase price (which can take many values). Thus, these became the convention for calculating discount yields. Although these features mean that the discount yield is a measure of return that is incorrect, convention has not changed, even as calculators and computers have become commonplace. An appropriate comparison of interest rates on discount securities versus nondiscount securities, adjusting for both the base price and days in the year differences, requires converting a discount yield into a bond equivalent yield in the following manner:

$$ i_{be} = i_d \times \frac{P_f}{P_0} \times \frac{365}{360} $$

**Example 5-2 Comparison of Discount Yield, Bond Equivalent Yield, and EAR**

Suppose you can purchase a $1 million Treasury bill that is currently selling on a discount basis (i.e., with no explicit interest payments) at 98½ percent of its face value. The T-bill is 140 days from maturity (when the $1 million will be paid). Depending on the setting in which you are interested, any one of the following three yields or interest rates could be appropriate:

Discount yield: $i_d = \left[ \frac{(\$1,000,000 - \$985,000)}{\$1,000,000} \right] \times \frac{360}{140} = 3.857\%$

Bond equivalent yield: $i_{be} = \left[ \frac{(\$1,000,000 - \$985,000)}{\$985,000} \right] \times \frac{365}{140} = 3.970\%$

EAR: $EAR = \left[1 + \frac{0.03970}{365/140}\right]^{365/140} - 1 = 4.019\%$

### Single-Payment Yields

Some money market securities (e.g., negotiable CDs and fed funds) pay interest only once during their lives: at maturity. Thus, the single-payment security holder receives a terminal payment consisting of interest plus the face value of the security, as we show in the following time line. Such securities are special cases of the pure discount securities that only pay the face value on maturity.

$$
\begin{array}{c c} \text{In ve st} \\ 0 \end{array} \stackrel {{\text{Re ci ev e}}} {{\longrightarrow}} \begin{array}{c} \text{Re ci ev e} \\ \text{Ma tu ri ty} \end{array}
$$

Further, quoted nominal interest rates on single-payment securities (or single-payment yield,  $i_{sp}$ ) normally assume a 360-day year. In order to compare interest rates on these securities with others, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, that pay interest based on a 365-day year, the nominal interest rate must be converted to a bond equivalent yield in the following manner:

$$ i_{b e} = i_{s p} (3 6 5 / 3 6 0)
$$

Further, allowing for interest rate compounding, the EAR for single-payment securities must utilize the bond equivalent yield as follows:

$$
E A R = \left[ 1 + \frac{i_{s p} (3 6 5 / 3 6 0)}{3 6 5 / n} \right]^{3 6 5 / n} - 1
$$ or,


$$

E A R = \left[ 1 + i_{b e} / (3 6 5 / n) \right]^{3 6 5 / n} - 1

$$

**Example 5-3 Comparison of Single-Payment Yield, Bond Equivalent Yield, and EAR**

Suppose you can purchase a 1 million negotiable CD that is currently 105 days from maturity. The CD has a quoted annual interest rate of 4.16 percent for a 360-day year. The bond equivalent yield is calculated as:

$$ i_{b e} = 4.16 \% (365 / 360) = 4.218 \%
$$

The EAR on the CD is calculated as:

$$
E A R = [ 1 + (0.04218) / (365 / 105) ]^{365 / 105} - 1 = 4.282 \%
$$

## Do You Understand?

3. What characteristics of a discount yield prevent it from being directly compared to a bond equivalent yield?

Table 5-1 lists various money market instruments and their quoted interest rates, as reported in The Wall Street Journal for December 31, 2019 (www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/ moneyrates). Current market rates (as well as data on stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and other securities) can also be found at Bloomberg's website, www.bloomberg.com/markets/ rates-bonds. As we proceed with the discussion of the various money market instruments, pay particular attention to the convention used to state returns in the various money markets. For example, Treasury bill rates are stated as discount yields and use a 360-day year. Commercial paper and banker's acceptance yields are also quoted as discount yields. Federal funds, repurchase agreements, and negotiable certificates of deposit are stated on a single-payment yield basis. Differences in the convention used to calculate yields must be considered particularly when comparing returns across various securities.

## Money Market Securities

A variety of money market securities are issued by corporations and government units to obtain short-term funds. These securities include Treasury bills, federal funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit, and banker's acceptances. In this section, we look at the characteristics of each of these. Table 5-2 defines each of the money market securities, and Table 5-3 lists the amounts of each outstanding and the interest rate on each of these instruments in 1990 and 2018. As noted in previous chapters, in the late 2000s, as the U.S. economy faced a severe financial crisis and fell into its deepest recession since the Great Depression, in a historic move the Fed unexpectedly announced that it would drop its target fed funds rate to a range between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent and lowered its discount window rate to one-half percent.

### Treasury Bills

#### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Short-term obligations of the U.S. government issued to cover government budget deficits and to refinance maturing government debt.

# www.federalreserve.gov

Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term obligations of the U.S. government issued to cover current government budget shortfalls (deficits) and to refinance maturing government debt. As discussed in Chapter 4, Treasury bill purchases and sales are also a main tool used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy. For example, in the late 2000s, to stimulate the economy and increase the amount of funding available in the economy, the Fed purchased large amounts of Treasury bills. In 2018 there were over \$2.3 trillion of Treasury bills outstanding, up from \$1 trillion in 2007. T-bills are sold through an auction process (described below). Original maturities are 4, 13, 26, and 52 weeks, and they are issued in denominations of multiples of \$100. The minimum allowable denomination for a T-bill bid is \$100. A typical purchase in the newly issued T-bill market is a round lot of 5 million. However, existing T-bills can be bought and sold in an active secondary market through government securities dealers who purchase Treasury bills from the U.S. government and resell them to investors. Thus, investors wanting to purchase smaller amounts of T-bills can do so through a dealer for a fee.

Because they are backed by the U.S. government, T-bills are virtually default risk free. In fact, T-bills are often referred to as the risk-free asset in the United States. Further, because of their short-term nature and active secondary market, T-bills have little interest rate risk and liquidity risk.

#### Treasury Bill Auctions

The formal process by which the U.S. Treasury sells new issues of Treasury bills.

The New Issue and Secondary Market Trading Process for Treasury Bills. The U.S. Treasury has a formal process by which it sells new issues of Treasury bills through its regular Treasury bill auctions. Every week (usually on a Thursday), the amount of new T-bills the Treasury will offer for sale is announced. Bids may be submitted by government securities dealers, financial and nonfinancial corporations, and individuals and must be received by a Federal Reserve Bank (over the Internet [through TreasuryDirect³], by phone, or by paper form) immediately after the auction announcement. Allocations and prices are announced within two minutes of the auction close (11:30 a.m. for bills and floating rate notes, and 1:00 p.m. for notes,bonds, and TIPS on the day of the auction). Auctions for 13-week and 26-week Treasury bills are usually held weekly on a Monday.

Submitted bids can be either competitive bids or noncompetitive bids. As of 1998, all successful bidders (both competitive and noncompetitive) are awarded securities at the same price, which is the price equal to the lowest price of the competitive bids accepted (as will be explained below). Prior to this, Treasury security auctions were discriminatory auctions in that different successful bidders paid different prices (their bid prices). Appendix 5A to this chapter (available through Connect or your course

2. The excess of U.S. government expenditures minus revenues.
3. TreasuryDirect, operated by the Office of the U.S. Treasury, allows investors to buy and sell Treasury securities directly from the Treasury Department.

www.ustreas.gov instructor) discusses the reasons behind the change and the benefits to the U.S. Treasury from a single price auction.

Competitive bids specify the amount of par value of bills desired (the minimum is  \$100) and the discount yield (in increments of 0.005\%$ ), rather than the price. The amount of noncompetitive bids is subtracted from the total face value of the auctioned bills, with the remainder to be allocated to competitive bidders. Competitive bids are then ranked from the lowest discount yield (highest price) to the highest yield (lowest price). The cut-off yield (the yield of the last accepted bid) is the highest accepted discount yield. It is known as the stop-out yield or stop-out rate of the auction. It determines the price per 100 that every successful bidder pays. All bids with yields above the stop-out yields are rejected. If the amount of competitive bids at the stop-out yield exceeds the amount of bills remaining to be allocated after the superior bids have been allocated, the bids at the stop-out rate are distributed on a pro-rata basis. For example, if the bids at the stop-out yield total \$5 billion of par value, but there is only \$3 billion of par value remaining after satisfying noncompetitive bids and competitive bids with lower yields (higher prices), then the bidders whose yield turned out to be the stop-out yield will receive 60 percent of their desired allocations (\$3 billion/\$5 billion). This proportion is reported as "allotted at high" in the U.S. Treasury auction result announcements. Bidders cannot submit negative yields in T-bill auctions but may submit a yield of zero, which means that they are willing to pay face value and earn no income from the bills.

Competitive bids are generally used by large investors and government securities dealers and make up the majority of the auction market. Table 5-4 shows the results of the Treasury auction of 13and 26-week Treasury bills on December 16, 2019. At this auction, 37.08 percent and 38.11 percent of the total submitted bids were accepted for the 13and 26-week T-bills, respectively. Figure 5-1 illustrates the T-bill auction for the 26-week T-bills. The highest accepted bid price on the 26-week T-bills was 99.251778 percent of the face value of the T-bills. Bids were filled at prices below the high. The lowest accepted bid price was 99.216389 percent. The median accepted bid price was 99.231556 percent. All bidders who submitted prices above 99.216389 percent (categories 1 through 5 in Figure 5-1) were awarded in full (winning bids) at a price of 99.216389 percent. Thus, those who submitted a bid at a price greater than 99.216389 percent paid less than their bid price yet received their full allocation of T-bills requested. Bidders who submitted a price below 99.216389 percent (categories 7 and beyond in Figure 5-1) received no allocation of the auctioned T-bills. Finally, of the bidders whose yield turned out to be the stop-out yield (i.e., the price submitted was exactly 99.216389 percent, category 6 in Figure 5-1), 96.62 percent received their desired allocations (the "allotted at high").

Noncompetitive bids are limited to 5 million for a single bidder; they specify only the desired amount of the face value of the bills. Noncompetitive bids usually represent a small portion of total Treasury bills auctioned. If the amount of noncompetitive bids exceeds the amount of bills auctioned, all noncompetitive bids are satisfied on a pro-rata basis, all competitive bids are rejected, and the price of the bills is set at par, reflecting a

Noncompetitive bids allow small investors to participate in the T-bill auction market without incurring large risks. That is, small investors who are unfamiliar with money market interest rate movements can use a noncompetitive bid to avoid bidding a price too low to receive any of the T-bills or bidding too high and paying more than the "fair" market price. Notice, from Table 5-4, that 2.58 percent ( $1.03b/$ 39.97b) and 2.01 percent ( $0.69b/$ 34.31b), respectively, of the accepted bids at the Dec 16, 2019 Treasury auction were noncompetitive for 13and 26-week T-bills. This resulted in a supply of T-bills available to competitive bidders ( $S_{C}$ ) that is lower than the total supply ( $S_{T}$ ) because of the preferential bidding status of noncompetitive bidders (i.e., noncompetitive bidders always receive a 100 percent allocation of their bids).

Figure 5-1 Treasury Auction Results

The secondary market for T-bills is the largest of any U.S. money market security. At the heart of this market are those securities dealers designated as primary government securities dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (consisting of 24 financial institutions) who purchase the majority of the T-bills sold competitively at auction and who create an active secondary market. In addition, there are many (approximately 500) smaller dealers who directly trade in the secondary market. Primary dealers make a market for T-bills by buying and selling securities for their own account and by trading for their customers, including depository institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, and so on. T-bill transactions by primary dealers averaged 115.36 billion per day in 2018. The T-bill market is decentralized, with most trading transacted over the telephone. Brokers keep track of the market via closed circuit television screens located in the trading rooms of the primary dealers. These television screens display bid and asked prices available at any point in time. Treasury markets are generally open from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. EST.

Secondary market T-bill transactions between primary government securities dealers are conducted over the Federal Reserve's wire transfer service—Fedwire (see Chapter 4)—and are recorded via the Federal Reserve's book-entry system. We illustrate a transaction in Figure 5-2. For example, if JPMorgan Chase wants to sell \$10 million of T-bills to Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase would instruct its district Federal Reserve Bank—the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY)—to electronically transfer the (book-entry) T-bills, via the Fedwire, from its account to Bank of New York Mellon (also in the district of the FRBNY). The transaction would be recorded in the Fed's book-entry system with no physical transfer of paper necessary. An individual wanting to purchase \$50,000 of T-bills in the secondary market must contact his or her bank or broker.

Purchase by an individual: the transaction. The T-bill dealer will instruct its local Federal Reserve Bank to increase (credit) its T-bill account at the Fed. In exchange for the investor's 50,000, these securities are subsequently recorded in the dealer's book-entry system as an issue held for the investor. T-bill dealers maintain records identifying owners of all Treasury securities held in its account in the book-entry system.

Treasury Bill Yields. As we discussed previously, Treasury bills are sold on a discount basis. Rather than directly paying interest on T-bills (the coupon rate is zero), the government issues T-bills at a discount from their par (or face) value. The return comes from the difference between the purchase price paid for the T-bill and the face value received at maturity. During the financial crisis, investors worldwide, searching for a safe haven for their funds, invested huge amounts of funds in U.S. Treasury securities. The amount of money invested in Treasury bills was so large that the yield on the three-month Treasury bill went below zero for the first time ever. Investors were essentially paying the U.S. government to borrow money.

Table 5-5 lists T-bill rates as quoted in The Wall Street Journal for trading on December 27, 2019. Column 1 in the quote lists the maturity date of the T-bill. Column 2, labeled Bid, is the discount yield (defined below) on the T-bill given the current selling price available to T-bill holders (i.e., the price dealers are willing to pay T-bill holders to purchase their T-bills for them). Column 3, labeled Asked, is the discount yield based on the current purchase price set by dealers that is available to investors (i.e., potential T-bill buyers). The percentage difference in the ask and bid yields is known as the spread. The spread is essentially the profit the dealers make in return for conducting the trade for investors. It is part of the transaction cost incurred by investors for the trade. Column 4, labeled Chg, is the change in the asked (discount) yield from the previous day's closing yield. Finally, the last column (column 5), labeled Asked Yield, is the asked discount yield converted to a bond equivalent yield. As discussed above, the discount yield  $(d)$  on a T-bill is calculated as follows:

$$ i_{\mathrm{T -b il l}, d} = \frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{f}} \times \frac{3 6 0}{n}
$$

**Example 5-4 Calculating a Treasury Bill Asked Discount Yield**

Suppose that you purchase the T-bill maturing on March 26, 2020, for  \$9,961.87. The T-bill matures 90 days after the quote date, December 27, 2019, and has a face value of\$ 10,000. The T-bill's Asked discount yield is calculated as:

$$ i_{\mathrm{T -bill},d} = \frac{\mathbb{S}10,000 - \mathbb{S}9,961.87}{\mathbb{S}10,000}\times \frac{360}{90} = 1.525\%
$$

Thus, 1.525 percent is the Asked discount yield on this T-bill reported in column 3 of Table 5-5.

As described above, the discount yield differs from a true rate of return (or bond equivalent yield) for two reasons: (1) the base price used is the face value of the T-bill and not the purchase price of the T-bill, and (2) a 360-day year rather than a 365-day year is used. The bond equivalent yield uses a 365-day year and the purchase price, rather than the face value of the T-bill, as the base price. Thus, the formula for a bond equivalent yield on a T-bill,  $i_{\mathrm{T -bill},be}$ , is:

$$ i_{\mathrm{T -b il l}, b e} = \frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{0}} \times \frac{3 6 5}{n}
$$

For example, the bond equivalent yield (or Asked Yield reported in column 5 of Table 5-5) in Example 5-4 is calculated as:

$$ i_{\mathrm{T -bill},be} = \frac{\mathbb{S}10,000 - \mathbb{S}9,961.87}{\mathbb{S}9,961.87}\times \frac{365}{90} = 1.55\%
$$

Finally, the  $EAR$  on the T-bill is calculated as:

$$
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.0155}{365 / 90}\right)^{365 / 90} - 1 = 1.56\%
$$

A Treasury bill's price (such as that used in the examples previously) can be calculated from the quote reported in the financial press (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) by rearranging the yield equations listed above. Specifically, for the asked discount yield, the required market ask price would be:

$$
P_{0} = P_{f} - \left(i_{\mathrm{T} - \text{bi ll}, d} \times \frac{n}{3 6 0} \times P_{f}\right)
$$ and for the bond equivalent yield:


$$

P_{0} = P_{f} / \left[ 1 + \left(i_{\mathrm{T -b il l}, b e} \times \frac{n}{3 6 5}\right) \right]

$$

**Example 5-5 Calculation of Treasury Bill Price from a Wall Street Journal Quote**

From Table 5-5, the asked (or discount) yield on the T-bill maturing on June 11, 2020 (or 167 days from the quote date, December 27, 2019), is 1.528 percent. The T-bill price for these T-bills is calculated as:

$$

P_{0} = \$ 1 0, 0 0 0 - \left(0. 0 1 5 2 8 \times \frac{1 6 7}{3 6 0} \times \$ 1 0, 0 0 0\right) = 9, 9 2 9. 1 2

$$ or using the asked yield (or the bond equivalent yield) on the T-bill, 1.56 percent:


$$

P_{0} = \$ 10,000 / \left[ 1 + \left(0. 0 1 5 6 \times \frac{1 6 7}{3 6 5}\right) \right] = \$ 9, 9 2 9. 1 2

# federal funds (fed funds)

Short-term funds transferred between financial institutions, usually for a period of one day.

# federal funds rate

The interest rate for borrowing fed funds.

### Federal Funds

Federal funds (fed funds) are short-term loans between financial institutions, usually for a period of one day. For example, commercial banks trade fed funds in the form of excess reserves held at their local Federal Reserve Bank. That is, one commercial bank may be short of reserves, requiring it to borrow excess reserves from another bank that has a surplus. The institution that borrows fed funds incurs a liability on its balance sheet, "federal funds purchased," while the institution that lends the fed funds records an asset, "federal funds sold." The overnight (or one day) interest rate in the interbank lending market is the federal funds rate. The fed funds rate is a function of the supply and demand for federal funds among financial institutions and the effects of the Federal Reserve's trading through the FOMC (as discussed in Chapter 4).

One of the primary risks of the interbank lending system is that the borrowing bank does not have to pledge collateral for the funds it receives, which are usually in millions of dollars. While the Fed has the ability to use open market operations to influence the interest rates banks charge each other and can introduce new capital to encourage banks to lend, the interbank loans are conducted with little scrutiny between parties. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 produced unprecedented and persistent strains in interbank lending and exposed problems produced by banks that were heavily leveraged with fed funds. The financial crisis created a huge demand for liquid assets across the entire financial system. Rather than lend excess funds in the interbank market, banks preferred to hold onto liquid assets just in case their own needs might increase. Banks also grew concerned about the risks of borrowing banks and became increasingly unwilling to lend, even at very high interest rates, as the level of confidence in the banking system plunged. Interbank loans fell to  \$153 billion in June 2010 from a peak of\$ 494 billion in September 2008, the month that Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. Unable to borrow in the interbank market, U.S. banks turned to the Fed for short-term borrowing, and the Fed obliged. At the height of the financial crisis, the Fed unexpectedly announced that it would drop its target fed funds rate to a range between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent. (The rate remained at these historically low levels until December 2015.) Eventually, unprecedented actions by the Fed to add liquidity and guarantee bank debt were able to counter the record strains in the interbank market. However, the financial crisis made it painfully clear that financial institutions cannot always count on being able to borrow at a low cost when needed.

Federal Funds Yields. Federal funds (fed funds) are single-payment loans—they pay interest only once, at maturity. Further, fed funds transactions take the form of short-term (mostly overnight) unsecured loans. Quoted interest rates on fed funds,  $i_{ff,sp}$ , assume a 360-day year. Therefore, to compare interest rates on fed funds with other securities such as Treasury bills, the quoted fed funds interest rate must be converted into a bond equivalent rate or yield,  $i_{ff,be}$ .

**Example 5-6 Conversion of Federal Funds Rate of Interest to a Bond Equivalent Rate**

From Table 5-1, the overnight fed funds rate on December 31, 2019, was 1.47 percent. The conversion of the fed funds rate to a bond equivalent rate is calculated as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} i_{f f, b e} = i_{f f, s p} (3 6 5 / 3 6 0) \\ = 1.47 \% (365 / 360) = 1.4904 \% \\ \end{array}

$$

Remembering that fed funds are generally lent for one day, the EAR on the fed funds can then be calculated as:

$$

EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.014904}{365 / 1}\right)^{365 / 1} - 1 = 1.5015\%

$$

In addition to being the cost of unsecured, overnight, interbank borrowing, the federal funds rate is of particular importance because, as was discussed in Chapter 4, it is a focus or target rate in the conduct of monetary policy.

Trading in the Federal Funds Market. The fed funds market is a highly liquid and flexible source of funding for commercial banks and savings banks. Commercial banks, especially the largest commercial banks, conduct the vast majority of transactions in the fed funds market. Fed funds transactions are created by banks borrowing and lending excess reserves held at their Federal Reserve Bank (see Chapter 4), using Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's wire transfer network, to complete the transaction. Banks with excess reserves lend fed funds, while banks with deficient reserves borrow fed funds.

Federal funds transactions can be initiated by either the lending or the borrowing bank, with negotiations between any pair of commercial banks taking place directly over the telephone. Alternatively, trades can be arranged through fed funds brokers (such as ICAP and Tullett Prebon), who charge a small fee for bringing the two parties to the fed funds transaction together.[5]

# correspondent banks

Banks with reciprocal accounts and agreements.

Figure 5-3 illustrates a fed funds transaction. For example, a bank that finds itself with  \$75 million in excess reserves (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) can call its correspondent banks (banks with which it has reciprocal accounts and agreements) to see if they need overnight reserves. The bank will then sell its excess reserves to those correspondent banks that offer the highest rates for these fed funds (e.g., Bank of America). When a transaction is agreed upon, the lending bank (JPMorgan Chase) instructs its district Federal Reserve Bank (e.g., the FRBNY) to transfer the\$ 75 million in excess reserves to the borrowing bank's (Bank of America) reserve account at its Federal Reserve Bank (e.g., the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco). The Federal Reserve System's wire transfer network, Fedwire, is used to complete the transfer of funds. The next day, the funds are transferred back, via Fedwire, from the borrowing bank to the lending bank's reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank plus one day's interest. Overnight fed funds loans will likely be based on an oral agreement between the two parties and are generally unsecured loans.

# repurchase agreement (repo or RP)

An agreement involving the sale of securities by one party to another with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified price and on a specified date.

### Repurchase Agreements

A repurchase agreement (repo or RP) is an agreement involving the Purchase of securities by one party (the repo buyer) to another party, (the repo seller) with a promise to sell the securities at a specified price and on a specified date in the future. Most repurchase agreements are collateralized, with the seller holding securities to back the transaction. The repo buyer acquires title to the securities for the term of the agreement. Thus, a repurchase agreement is essentially a collateralized fed funds loan. One-day maturity repos are called overnight repos and repos with longer maturities are called term repos. The securities used most often as collateral in repos are U.S. Treasury securities (e.g., T-bills) and government agency securities (e.g., Fannie Mae). Collateral pledged in a repurchase agreement has a "haircut" applied, which means the loan is slightly smaller than the market value of securities pledged. This haircut reflects the underlying risk of the collateral and protects the repo buyer against a change in the value of the collateral. Haircuts are specific to classes of collateral. For example, a U.S. Treasury bill might have one haircut rate, a government agency

5. Brokerage fees are often as low as 50 cents per 1 million transacted.
6. Correspondent bank relations are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.
7. Increasingly, participants in the fed funds markets do not hold balances at the Federal Reserve (e.g., commercial banks that do not belong to the Federal Reserve System). In this case, the fed funds transaction is settled in immediately available funds-fed funds on deposit at the lending bank that may be transferred or withdrawn with no delay. A federal funds broker, typically a commercial bank, matches up institutions using a telecommunications network that links federal funds brokers with participating institutions. Upon maturity of the fed funds loan, the borrowing bank's fed funds demand deposit account at the lending bank is debited for the total value of the loan and the borrowing bank pays the lending bank an interest payment for the use of the fed funds. Most of these fed funds transactions are for more than \$5 million (they averaged around \$40 million in the 2010s) and usually have a one- to seven-day maturity.

An agreement involving the purchase of securities by one party from another with the promise to sell them back.

security might have another haircut rate. A reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) is the lender's position in the repo transaction (i.e., an agreement involving the purchase (buying) of securities by one party from another with the promise to sell them back at a given date in the future).

Most repos have very short terms to maturity (generally from 1 to 14 days), but there is a growing market for longer-term one- to three-month repos. Repos with a maturity of less than one week generally involve denominations of  \$25 million or more. Longer-term repos are more often in denominations of\$ 10 million.

Many commercial firms, with idle funds in their deposit accounts at banks, use repos as a way to earn a small return until these funds are needed. In this case the firm uses its idle funds to buy T-bills from its bank. The bank then agrees to repurchase the T-bills in the future at a higher price. Banks generally pay no interest on corporate checking accounts. Thus, a repo is a way for a bank to allow its valued corporate customers to earn some interest on their balances. Other securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, may be used as repo collateral as well.

The Trading Process for Repurchase Agreements. Repurchase agreements are arranged either directly between two parties or with the help of brokers and dealers. Figure 5-4 illustrates a 75 million repurchase agreement of Treasury bonds arranged directly between two parties (e.g., JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America). The repo buyer, JPMorgan Chase, arranges to purchase fed funds from the repo seller, Bank of America, with an agreement that the seller will repurchase the fed funds within a stated period of time—one day. The repo is collateralized with T-bonds.

Once the transaction is agreed upon, the repo buyer, JPMorgan Chase, instructs its district Federal Reserve Bank (the FRBNY) to transfer  \$75 million in excess reserves, via Fedwire, to the repo seller's reserve account. The repo seller, Bank of America, instructs its district Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB of San Francisco) to transfer\$ 75 million from its T-bond account via securities Fedwire to the repo buyer's T-bond account. Upon maturity of the repo (one day in this example), these transactions are reversed. In addition, the repo seller transfers additional funds (representing one day's interest) from its reserve account to the reserve account of the repo buyer.

Repurchase Agreement Yields. Because Treasury securities back most repurchase agreements, they are low credit risk investments and have lower interest rates than uncollateralized fed funds. $^{8}$  The yield on repurchase agreements is calculated as the annualized percentage difference between the initial selling price of the securities and the contracted (re)purchase price (the selling price plus interest paid on the repurchase agreement), using a 360-day year. Specifically:

$$ i_{r e p o, s p} = \frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{0}} \times \frac{3 6 0}{n}
$$ where


$P_{f} =$  Repurchase price of the securities (equals the selling price plus interest paid on the repurchase agreement)

$P_{0} =$  Selling price of the securities

$n =$  Number of days until the repo matures

**Example 5-7 Calculation of a Yield on a Repurchase Agreement**

Suppose a bank enters a repurchase agreement in which it agrees to buy fed funds from one of its correspondent banks at a price of  \$10,000,000, with the promise to sell these funds back at a price of$ 10,000,291.67 ($10,000,000 plus interest of \$291.67) after five days. The yield on this repo to the bank is calculated as follows:

$$ i_{r e p o, s p} = \frac{\mathrm{\10,000,291.67 - \10,000,000}}{\mathrm{\10,000,000}} \times \frac{360}{5} = 0.21 \%
$$

Because of their common use as a source of overnight funding and the fact that repos are essentially collateralized fed fund transactions, the Federal Reserve generally classifies federal funds and repurchase agreements together in its statistical data. Together, these amounted to more than 4.1 trillion outstanding in 2019 (see Table 5-3). Some notable differences exist, however, between repurchase agreements and fed funds. For example, repurchase agreements are less liquid than fed funds since they can only be arranged after an agreed upon type of collateral is posted (i.e., repos are hard to arrange at the close of the banking day, whereas fed funds can be arranged at very short notice, even a few minutes). Further, nonbanks are more frequent users of repurchase agreements.

### Commercial Paper

# commercial paper

An unsecured short-term promissory note issued by a company to raise short-term cash, often to finance working capital requirements.

www.sec.gov

Commercial paper is an unsecured short-term promissory note issued by a corporation to raise short-term cash, often to finance working capital requirements. Commercial paper is one of the largest (in terms of dollar value outstanding) of the money market instruments, with almost 1.1 trillion outstanding as of December 2019. One reason for such large amounts of commercial paper outstanding is that companies with strong credit ratings can generally borrow money at a lower interest rate by issuing commercial paper than by directly borrowing (via loans) from banks. Indeed, although business loans were the major asset on bank balance sheets between 1965 and 1990, they have dropped in importance since 1990. This trend reflects the growth of the commercial paper market. Figure 5-5 illustrates the difference between the commercial paper rate and the prime rate for borrowing from banks from 1973 through 2019. Notice that in the 1990s and 2000s, the spread between the prime rate and commercial paper rate increased relative to the 1970s and 1980s.

Commercial paper is generally sold in denominations of  $100,000,$ 250,000, \$500,000, and \$1 million. Maturities generally range from 1 to 270 days—the most common maturities are between 20 and 45 days. This 270-day maximum is due to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that securities with a maturity of more than 270 days must go through the time-consuming and costly registration process to become a public debt offering (i.e., a corporate bond). As a result, at maturity most commercial paper is rolled over into new issues of commercial paper (again avoiding the SEC registration process). Commercial paper can be sold directly by the issuers to a buyer such as a mutual fund (a direct placement) or can be sold indirectly by dealers in the commercial paper market. The dollar value outstanding (in thousands of dollars) via each method of issue from 1991 through 2019 is reported in Figure 5-6. Notice that dealer placements of commercial paper dominated the market except for between 2010 and 2013. Further, the total dollar value of commercial paper outstanding decreased significantly after the financial crisis. We discuss reasons for these trends below.

Commercial paper is generally held by investors from the time of issue until maturity. Thus, there is no active secondary market for commercial paper.[10] Because commercial paper is not actively traded and because it is also unsecured debt, the credit rating of the issuing company is of particular importance in determining the marketability of a commercial paper issue. Credit ratings provide potential investors with information regarding the ability of the issuing firm to repay the borrowed funds, as promised, and to compare the commercial paper issues of different companies. Several credit rating firms rate commercial paper issues (e.g., Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch Ratings). Standard & Poor's rates commercial paper from A-1 for highest-quality issues to D for lowest-quality issues, while Moody's rates commercial paper from P-1 for highest-quality issues to "not rated" for lowest-quality issues. Virtually all companies that issue commercial paper obtain ratings from at least one rating services company, and most obtain two rating evaluations.

Commercial paper issuers with lower than prime credit ratings often back their commercial paper issues with a letter of credit obtained from a commercial bank. In these cases, the bank agrees to make the promised payment on the commercial paper if the issuer cannot pay off the debt on maturity. Thus, a letter of credit backing commercial paper effectively substitutes the credit rating of the issuer with the credit rating of the bank. This reduces the risk to the purchasers of the paper and results in a lower interest rate (and higher credit rating) on the commercial paper. In other cases, an issuer arranges a line of credit with a bank (a loan commitment) and draws on this line if it has insufficient funds to meet the repayment of the commercial paper issue at maturity.

In the early 2000s, the slowdown in the U.S. economy resulted in ratings downgrades for some of the largest commercial paper issuers. For example, the downgrade of General Motors and Ford from a tier-one to tier-two commercial paper issuer had a huge impact on the commercial paper markets. The result is that these commercial paper issuers were forced to give up the cost advantage of commercial paper and to move to the long-term debt markets to ensure they would have access to cash. The decrease in the number of eligible commercial paper issuers in the early 2000s resulted in a decrease in the size of the commercial paper market for the first time in 40 years (see Figure 5-6).

The mid-2000s saw a huge rise in the use of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). In July 2007,  \$1.19 trillion of the total\$ 2.16 trillion commercial paper outstanding was ABCP. ABCP is collateralized by other financial assets of the issuer. The financial assets that serve as collateral for ABCP are ordinarily a mix of many different assets, which are jointly judged to have a low risk of bankruptcy by a ratings agency. In the mid-2000s, the collateralized assets were mainly mortgage-backed securities. However, in 2007–2008 many of these mortgage-backed securities performed more poorly than expected. Billions of dollars of asset-backed commercial paper were tainted because some of the proceeds were used to buy investments tied to U.S. subprime mortgages. Issuers found buyers much less willing to purchase ABCP. The result was another big drop in the dollar value of the commercial paper markets. In November 2019, just  \$242 billion of ABCP was outstanding (of the total\$ 1,108 billion commercial paper market).

In addition, on September 16, 2008 (one day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy), Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest money market fund in the United States, saw its shares fall to 97 cents (below the  \$1.00 book value) after writing off debt issued by Lehman Brothers. Resulting investor anxiety about Reserve Primary Fund spread to other funds, and money market mutual fund withdrawals skyrocketed. Fund investors pulled out a record\$ 144.5 billion during the week ending Wednesday, September 17 (redemptions during the week of September 10 totaled just \$7.1 billion), as investors worried about the safety of even these safest investments. Money market mutual funds participate heavily in the commercial paper market. As investors pulled their money from these funds, the commercial paper market shrank by \$52.1 billion for the week (through Wednesday). These outflows severely undermined the stability of short-term funding markets, upon which many financial institutions and large corporations rely heavily to meet their short-term borrowing needs. In response, the Federal Reserve Board announced the creation of the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), a facility that complemented the Federal Reserve's existing credit facilities, to help provide liquidity to short-term funding markets. Under the plan, the Federal Reserve stepped in to purchase commercial paper and other short-term debt.

Even as markets stabilized after the financial crisis, outstanding values of financial and nonfinancial commercial paper continued to fall: from over  \$2.16 trillion at its peak in July 2007, the commercial paper market fell to\$ 1.76 trillion in July 2008, \$1.21 trillion in July 2009, and just \$0.99 trillion in July 2013. Reasons for this continued fall include a combination of related factors. First, negative and low positive economic growth experienced for years after the financial crisis produced lower demand for funds and thus less of a need to issue commercial paper. Second, financial and nonfinancial firms held record amounts of cash reserves after the financial crisis and thus did not need to borrow as much in the short-term commercial paper markets. Finally, long-term debt rates were at historical lows after the financial crisis. As a result, many corporations increased their issuance of longer-term debt so as to lock in their financing costs at these low rates for many years: the financial crisis showed how risky rolling over short-term borrowings can be. Further, given the increased risk, direct placement of commercial paper became more difficult. Thus, dealer placement of commercial paper dominated the placement market. These changes can be seen in Figure 5-6.

The better the credit rating on a commercial paper issue, the lower the interest rate on the issue. The spread between the interest rate on Tier 2 (A2/P2) nonfinancial commercial paper and Tier 1(AA) nonfinancial commercial paper is shown in Figure 5-7. During the 1990s, the spread was generally on the order of 0.22 percent (22 basis points) per year. From June 2001 through June 2003, as the economy slowed, the spread increased to an average of 0.38 percent per year. In the mid-2000s, the spread was at times close to zero. However, as credit markets deteriorated in the summer of 2007 spreads again increased. For example, in August 2007, the spreads surged to 1.25 percent. The situation worsened throughout the financial crisis. Figure 5-7 shows that the cost of commercial paper funding skyrocketed for the Tier 2 commercial paper following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008. When the spread between Tier 1 versus Tier 2 commercial paper hit 1.60 percent in 2007, the market was shocked. However, this became minor when the spread increased to an eight-month high of 3.42 percent in September 2008 after the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a plan to rescue banks and then rose to 6.11 percent in December 2008. Usually the spread between Tier 1 and Tier 2 commercial paper reflects a concern for default on the riskier paper. But during the financial crisis the spread also reflected a lack of liquidity in the system: credit markets were essentially locked up waiting for the federal government to present some type of solution or bailout. While the Federal Reserve was able to bring commercial paper rates down during the crisis, the commercial paper market has yet to recover in terms of total amount outstanding (as of December 2019, the total amount of commercial paper outstanding was  \$1.1 trillion, about half of the pre-crisis high of\$ 2.2 trillion in July 2007).

The Trading Process for Commercial Paper. Commercial paper is sold to investors either directly (about 10 percent of all issues in 2019—see Figure 5-6), using the issuer's own sales force (e.g., GMAC), or indirectly through brokers and dealers, such as major bank subsidiaries that specialize in investment banking activities and investment banks underwriting the issues. Commercial paper underwritten and issued through brokers and dealers is more expensive to the issuer, usually increasing the cost of the issue by one-tenth to one-eighth of a percent, reflecting an underwriting cost. In return, the dealer guarantees, through a firm commitment underwriting, the sale of the whole issue. To help achieve this goal, the dealer contacts prospective buyers of the commercial paper, determines the appropriate discount rate on the commercial paper, and relays any special requests for the commercial paper in terms of specific quantities and maturities to the issuer. When a company issues commercial paper through a dealer, a request made at the beginning of the day by a potential investor (such as a money market mutual fund) for a particular maturity is often completed by the end of the day.

When commercial paper is issued directly from an issuer to a buyer, the company saves the cost of the dealer (and the underwriting services), but must find appropriate investors and determine the discount rate on the paper that will place the complete issue. When the firm decides how much commercial paper it wants to issue, it posts offering rates to potential buyers based on its own estimates of investor demand. The firm then monitors the flow of money during the day and adjusts its commercial paper rates depending on investor demand.

Commercial Paper Yields. Like Treasury bills, yields on commercial paper are quoted on a discount basis—the discount return to commercial paper holders is the annualized percentage difference between the price paid for the paper and the par value using a 360-day year. Specifically:

$$ i_{c p, d} = \frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{f}} \times \frac{3 6 0}{n}
$$ and when converted to a bond equivalent yield:


$$ i_{c p, b e} = \frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{0}} \times \frac{3 6 5}{n}
$$

**Example 5-8 Calculation of the Yield on Commercial Paper**

Suppose an investor purchases 95-day commercial paper with a par value of \$1,000,000 for a price of \$990,023. The discount yield (d) on the commercial paper is calculated as:

$$ i_{c p, d} = \frac{\mathrm{\1 ,000 ,000 - \990 ,023}}{\mathrm{\1 ,000 ,000}} \times \frac{360}{95} = 0.3702 \%
$$ and the bond equivalent yield  $(be)$  is:


$$ i_{c p, b e} = \frac{\mathrm{\1 ,000 ,000 - \990 ,023}}{\mathrm{\990 ,023}} \times \frac{365}{95} = 0.3757 \%
$$

Finally, the  $EAR$  on the commercial paper is:

$$
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.003757}{365 / 95}\right)^{365 / 95} - 1 = 0.3763\%
$$

# negotiable certificate of deposit (CD)

A bank-issued, fixed maturity, interest-bearing time deposit that specifies an interest rate and maturity date and is negotiable.

# bearer instrument

An instrument in which the holder at maturity receives the principal and interest.

### Negotiable Certificates of Deposit

A negotiable certificate of deposit (CD) is a bank-issued time deposit that specifies an interest rate and maturity date and is negotiable (i.e., salable) in the secondary market. As of 2016, there were over  \$1.86 trillion of negotiable CDs outstanding. A negotiable CD is a bearer instrument—whoever holds the CD when it matures receives the principal and interest. A negotiable CD can be traded any number of times in secondary markets; therefore, the original buyer is not necessarily the owner at maturity.[11] Negotiable CDs have denominations that range from$ 100,000 to $10 million; \$1 million is the most common denomination. The large denominations make negotiable CDs too large for most individuals to buy. However, negotiable CDs are often purchased by money market mutual funds (see Chapter 17), which pool funds of individual investors and allow this group to indirectly purchase negotiable CDs. Negotiable CD maturities range from two weeks to one year, with most having a maturity of one to four months.

While CDs have been used by banks since the early 1900s, they were not issued in a negotiable form until the early 1960s. Because of rising interest rates in the 1950s and significant interest rate penalties charged on the early withdrawal of funds invested in CDs, large CDs became unattractive to deposit holders. The result was a significant drop in deposits at banks (disintermediation). In 1961, First National City Bank of New York (now known as Citigroup) issued the first negotiable CD, and money market dealers agreed to make a secondary market in them. These negotiable CDs were well received and helped banks regain many of their lost deposits. Indeed, the success of negotiable CDs helped bank managers focus more actively on managing the liability side of their portfolios (see Chapter 22).

The Trading Process for Negotiable Certificates of Deposit. Banks issuing negotiable CDs post a daily set of rates for the most popular maturities of their negotiable CDs, normally 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. Then, subject to its funding needs, the bank tries to sell as many CDs to investors who are likely to hold them as investments rather than sell them to the secondary market.

In some cases, the bank and the CD investor directly negotiate a rate, the maturity, and the size of the CD. Once this is done, the issuing bank delivers the CD to a custodian bank specified by the investor. The custodian bank verifies the CD, debits the amount to the investor's account, and credits the amount to the issuing bank. This is done through the Fedwire system by transferring fed funds from the custodian bank's reserve account at the Fed to the issuing bank's reserve account.

The secondary market for negotiable CDs allows investors to buy existing negotiable CDs rather than new issues. While it is not a very active market, the secondary market for negotiable CDs is made up of a linked network of approximately 15 brokers and dealers using telephones to transact. The secondary market is predominantly located in New York City, along with most of the brokers and dealers.

The mechanics of the secondary market are similar to those of the primary market for negotiable CDs. Certificates are physically transported between traders or their custodian banks. The custodian bank verifies the certificate and records the deposit in the investor's account. Most transactions executed in the morning are settled the same day. Most transactions executed later in the day are settled the next business day.

Negotiable CD Yields. Negotiable CD rates are negotiated between the bank and the CD buyer. Large, well-known banks can offer CDs at slightly lower rates than smaller, less well-known banks. This is due partly to the lower perceived default risk and greater marketability of well-known banks and partly to the belief that larger banks are often "too big to fail"—regulators will bail out troubled large banks and protect large depositors beyond the explicit (250,000) deposit cap under the current FDIC insurance program (see Chapter 13). As mentioned earlier, negotiable CDs are single-payment securities. Thus, interest rates on negotiable CDs are generally quoted using a 360-day year.

**Example 5-9 Calculation of the Secondary Market Yield on a Negotiable CD**

A bank has issued a six-month, 1 million negotiable CD with a 0.72 percent quoted annual interest rate (iCD, sp). The bond equivalent yield on the CD is:

$$ i_{C D, b e} = 0.72 \% (365 / 360) = 0.73 \%
$$

Thus, at maturity (in 6 months) the CD holder will receive:

$$
F V = \ 1 \mathrm{m}. (1 + 0. 0 0 7 3 / 2) = \ 1, 0 0 3, 6 5 0
$$ in exchange for 1 million deposited in the bank today. Further, the EAR on the CD is:


$$

EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.0073}{2}\right)^{2} - 1 = 0.7313\%

$$

Immediately after the CD is issued, the secondary market price on the  \$1 million CD falls to\$ 999,651. As a result, the secondary market bond equivalent yield on the 1 million face value CD increases as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} 1, 0 0 3, 6 5 0 / (1 + i_{C D. b e} / 2) = \$ 9 9 9, 6 5 1 \\ \Rightarrow i_{C D, b e} = 0.8001 \% \\ \end{array}

$$

The single-payment yield increases to:

$$ i_{C D. s p} = 0.8001 \% (360 / 365) = 0.7891 \%
$$ and the EAR becomes:


$$

E A R = (1 + 0.008001 / 2)^{2} - 1 = 0.8017 \%

$$

# banker's acceptance

A time draft payable to a seller of goods, with payment guaranteed by a bank.

### Banker's Acceptances

A banker's acceptance is a time draft payable to a seller of goods, with payment guaranteed by a bank. Banker's acceptances make up an increasingly small part of the money markets. As a result, beginning in June 2002, banker's acceptance levels are included in the commercial paper levels and no longer differentiated from commercial paper. Time drafts issued by a bank are orders for the bank to pay a specified amount of money to the bearer of the time draft on a given date.

The Trading Process for Banker's Acceptances. Many banker's acceptances arise from international trade transactions and the underlying letters of credit (or time drafts) that are used to finance trade in goods that have yet to be shipped from a foreign exporter (seller) to a domestic importer (buyer). Foreign exporters often prefer that banks act as guarantors for payment before sending goods to domestic importers, particularly when the foreign supplier has not previously done business with the domestic importer on a regular basis. In the United States, a majority of all acceptances are originated in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. The U.S. bank insures the international transaction by stamping "Accepted" on a time draft written against the letter of credit between the exporter and the importer, signifying its obligation to pay the foreign exporter (or its bank) on a specified date should the importer fail to pay for the goods. Foreign exporters can then hold the banker's acceptance (the accepted time draft written against the letter of credit) until the date specified on the letter of credit. If they have an immediate need for cash, they can sell the acceptance before that date at a discount from the face value to a buyer in the money market (e.g., a bank). In this case, the ultimate bearer will receive the face value of the banker's acceptance on maturity. We describe this process in more detail in Appendix 5B to this chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor).


Because banker's acceptances are payable to the bearer at maturity, they can be and are traded in secondary markets. Maturities on banker's acceptances traded in secondary markets range from 30 to 270 days. Denominations of banker's acceptances are determined by the size of the original transaction (between the domestic importer and the foreign exporter). Once in the secondary markets, however, banker's acceptances are often bundled and traded in round lots, mainly of  \$100,000 and\$ 500,000.

Only the largest U.S. banks are active in the banker's acceptance market. Because the risk of default is very low (essentially an investor is buying a security that is fully backed by commercial bank guarantees), interest rates on banker's acceptances are low. Specifically, there is a form of double protection underlying banker's acceptances that reduces their default risk. Since both the importer and the importer's bank must default on the transaction before the investor is subject to risk, the investor is also protected by the value of the goods imported to which he or she now has a debtor's claim—the goods underlying the transaction can be viewed as collateral. Like T-bills and commercial paper, banker's acceptances are sold on a discounted basis.

### Comparison of Money Market Securities

Having reviewed the different money market securities, it should be obvious that the different securities have a number of characteristics in common: large denominations, low default risk, and short maturities. It should also be noted that these securities are quite different in terms of their liquidity. For example, Treasury bills have an extensive secondary market. Thus, these money market securities can be converted into cash quickly and with little loss in value. Commercial paper, on the other hand, has no organized secondary market. These securities cannot be converted into cash quickly unless resold to the original dealer/underwriter, and conversion may involve a relatively higher cost. Federal funds also have no secondary market trading, since they are typically overnight loan transactions and are not intended as investments to be held beyond very short horizons (thus, the lack of a secondary market is inconsequential). Indeed, longer-horizon holders simply roll over their holdings. Bank negotiable CDs also can be traded on secondary markets, but in recent years trading has been relatively inactive, as most negotiable CDs are being bought by "buy and hold" oriented money market mutual funds, as are banker's acceptances.

## Money Market Participants

LG 5-4

The major money market participants are the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, commercial banks, money market mutual funds, brokers and dealers, corporations, other financial institutions such as insurance companies, and individuals. Table 5-6 summarizes the role (issuer or investor) each of these participants plays in the markets for the various money market securities.

### The U.S. Treasury

The U.S. Treasury raises significant amounts of funds in the money market when it issues T-bills. T-bills are the most actively traded of the money market securities. T-bills allow the U.S. government to raise money to meet unavoidable short-term expenditure needs prior to the receipt of tax revenues. Tax receipts are generally concentrated around quarterly dates, but government expenditures are more evenly distributed over the year.

### The Federal Reserve

The Federal Reserve is a key (arguably the most important) participant in the money markets. The Federal Reserve holds T-bills (as well as T-notes and T-bonds) to conduct open market transactions—purchasing T-bills when it wants to increase the money supply and selling T-bills when it wants to decrease the money supply. The Federal Reserve often uses repurchase agreements and reverse repos to temporarily smooth interest rates and the money supply. Moreover, the Fed targets the federal funds rate as part of its overall monetary policy strategy, which can in turn affect other money market rates. Finally, the Fed operates the discount window, which it can use to influence the supply of bank reserves to commercial banks and ultimately the demand for and supply of fed funds and repos.

### Commercial Banks

Commercial banks are the most diverse group of participants in the money markets. As Table 5-6 shows, banks participate as issuers and/or investors of almost all money market www.ustreas.gov


instruments discussed above. For example, banks are the major issuers of negotiable CDs, banker's acceptances, federal funds, and repurchase agreements.

The importance of banks in the money markets is driven in part by their need to meet reserve requirements imposed by regulation. For example, during periods of economic expansion, heavy loan demand can produce reserve deficiencies for banks (i.e., their actual reserve holdings are pushed below the minimums required by regulation). Additional reserves can be obtained by borrowing fed funds from other banks, engaging in a repurchase agreement, selling negotiable CDs, or selling commercial paper.[12] Conversely, during contractionary periods, many banks have excess reserves that they can use to purchase Treasury securities, trade fed funds, engage in reverse repos, and so on.

### Money Market Mutual Funds

Money market mutual funds purchase large amounts of money market securities and sell shares in these pools based on the value of their underlying (money market) securities (see Chapter 17). In doing so, money market mutual funds allow small investors to invest in money market instruments. In October 2019 money market mutual funds had 3.96 trillion invested in short-term financial securities—such as repurchase agreements, negotiable CDs, open market paper (mostly commercial paper), and U.S. government securities. Money market mutual funds provide an alternative investment opportunity to interest-bearing deposits at commercial banks.[13]

### Brokers and Dealers

Brokers' and dealers' services are important to the smooth functioning of money markets. We have alluded to various categories of brokers and dealers in this chapter. First are the 24 primary government security dealers. This group of participants plays a key role in marketing new issues of Treasury bills (and other Treasury securities). Primary government securities dealers also make the market in Treasury bills, buying securities from the Federal Reserve when they are issued and selling them in the secondary market. Secondary market transactions in the T-bill markets are transacted in the trading rooms of these primary dealers. These dealers also assist the Federal Reserve when it uses the repo market to temporarily increase or decrease the supply of bank reserves available.

The second group of brokers and dealers are money and security brokers. Some of the major brokers in this group are LPL Financial, Raymond James Financial Services, Commonwealth Financial Network, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, MML Investors Services, and Cambridge Investment Research. When government securities dealers trade with each other, they often use this group of brokers as intermediaries. These brokers also play a major role in linking buyers and sellers in the fed funds market and assist secondary trading in other money market securities as well. These brokers never trade for their own account, and they keep the names of dealers involved in trades they handle confidential.

The third group of brokers and dealers are the thousands of brokers and dealers who act as intermediaries in the money markets by linking buyers and sellers of money market securities (see Chapter 16). These brokers and dealers often act as the intermediaries for smaller investors who do not have sufficient funds to invest in primary issues of money market securities or who simply want to invest in the money markets.


### Corporations

Nonfinancial and financial corporations raise large amounts of funds in the money markets, primarily in the form of commercial paper. Because corporate cash inflows rarely equal their cash outflows, they often invest their excess cash funds in money market securities, especially T-bills, repos, commercial paper, negotiable CDs, and banker's acceptances.

### Other Financial Institutions

## Do You Understand?

10. Who the major money market participants are?
11. Which money market securities commercial banks issue?
12. What services brokers and dealers provide for money market participants?

Because their liability payments are relatively unpredictable, property-casualty (PC) insurance companies, and to a lesser extent life insurance companies, must maintain large balances of liquid assets (see Chapter 15). To accomplish this, insurance companies invest heavily in highly liquid money market securities, especially T-bills, repos, commercial paper, and negotiable CDs.

Since finance companies are not banks and cannot issue deposits, they raise large amounts of funds in the money markets (see Chapter 14), especially through the issuance of commercial paper.

### Individuals

Individual investors participate in the money markets through direct investments in these securities (e.g., negotiable CDs) or through investments in money market mutual funds, which contain a mix of all types of money market securities.

LG 5-5

While U.S. money markets are the largest and most active in the world, money markets across the world have been growing in size and importance. Two forms of growth include (1) U.S. money market securities bought and sold by foreign investors and (2) foreign money market securities. As a result of the growth in money markets worldwide, the flow of funds across borders in various countries has grown as international investors move their funds to money markets offering the most attractive yields. Table 5-7 lists the total amounts of various U.S. money market securities held by foreign investors from 1994 through 2018.

Note from Table 5-7 that foreign investments in U.S. money market securities increased from 1994 through 2007 (before the financial crisis). During the crisis, only foreign investments in Treasury securities increased significantly (from  \$2.376 trillion in 2007 to\$ 4.467 trillion in 2010). In contrast, foreign investments in repos decreased significantly (from  \$1.109 trillion in 2007 to$ -0.460 trillion in 2010), as did investments in open market paper (from  \$0.278 trillion in 2007 to\$ 0.191 trillion in 2010). During the financial crisis, investors worldwide, searching for a safe haven for their funds, invested huge amounts of funds in U.S. Treasury securities, while reducing investments in other money market (and capital market) securities. These trends reversed by the mid-2010s. For example, foreign investments in negotiable CDs rose to 0.594 trillion by 2018, surpassing pre-crisis levels. In addition, while central banks varied in the level of interest rates they set, all countries reduced their interest rates to historic lows during the financial crisis as they took steps to stimulate their local economies (see Table 5-8). For example, the United Kingdom lowered its repurchase rate from 5.75 percent in 2007, prior to the crisis, to 0.50 percent in 2010, during the crisis. Japan, whose economy was relatively weak in 2007, set its discount rate at 0.75 percent in 2007 and lowered it even further, to 0.10 percent, during the crisis. The low rates existed even into 2016 when the central banks of Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan all set interest rates below zero.

### Euro Money Markets

Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, many international financial contracts call for payment in U.S. dollars—the U.S. dollar is still the major international medium of exchange (62 percent of the world's currency reserves are held in U.S. dollars as of September 2019). As a result, foreign governments and businesses have historically held a store of funds (deposits) denominated in dollars outside of the United States. Further, U.S. corporations conducting international trade often hold U.S. dollar deposits in foreign banks overseas to facilitate expenditures and purchases. These dollar-denominated deposits held offshore in U.S. bank branches overseas and in other (foreign) banks are called Eurodollar deposits (Eurodollar CDs) and the market in which they trade is called the Eurodollar market. Eurodollars may be held by governments, corporations, and individuals from anywhere in the world and are not directly subject to U.S. bank

regulations, such as reserve requirements and deposit insurance premiums (or protection). As a result, the rate paid on Eurodollar CDs is generally higher than that paid on U.S.-domiciled CDs (see below). As an alternative to the Eurodollar market, companies can also obtain short-term funding by issuing Eurocommercial paper. Eurocommercial paper is issued in Europe but can be held by investors inside or outside of Europe.

The Eurodollar Market. Large banks in London organized the interbank Eurodollar market. This market is now used by banks around the world as a source of overnight funding. The term Eurodollar market is something of a misnomer because the markets have no true physical location. Rather, the Eurodollar market is simply a market in which dollars held outside the United States (so-called Eurodollars) are tracked among multinational banks, including the offices of U.S. banks abroad, such as Citigroup's branch in London or its subsidiary in London. For example, a company in Italy needing U.S. dollars for a foreign trade transaction might ask Citigroup's subsidiary in London to borrow these dollars on the Eurodollar market. Alternatively, a Greek bank needing U.S. dollar funding may raise the required funds by issuing a Eurodollar CD. Most Eurodollar transactions take place in London, Paris, Luxembourg, and Frankfurt. They are also widely held in branches located in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. Since Eurodollars are dollar balances held by banks or bank branches outside the United Status, banks are not required to hold reserves at the Fed and consequently have no direct access to settlement through Fedwire. Instead, Eurodollar balances settle on the private CHIPS network.

The rate offered for sale on Eurodollar funds is known as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Funds traded in the Eurodollar market are often used as an alternative to fed funds as a source of overnight funding for banks.[14] Initially, most short-term

#### London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)

The rate paid on Eurodollars.

adjustable-rate business loans were tied to the U.S. fed funds rate. However, the tremendous growth of the Eurodollar market has resulted in the LIBOR becoming the standard rate by which loan rates are now priced. For example, the commercial paper market in the United States has been quoting rates as a spread over the LIBOR rate rather than over the fed funds or Treasury bill rate. As alternative sources of overnight funding, the LIBOR and the U.S. federal funds rate tend to be very closely related. Should rates in one of these markets (e.g., the LIBOR market) decrease relative to the other (e.g., the fed funds market), overnight borrowers will borrow in the LIBOR market rather than the fed funds market. As a result, the LIBOR will increase with this increased demand and the fed funds rate will decrease with the decline in demand. This will make the difference between the two rates quite small, although not equal, as is discussed below. The ease of transacting in both markets makes it virtually costless to use one market versus the other.

The fed funds rate and overnight LIBOR between 2001 and 2019 are plotted in Figure 5-9. While they are close substitutes for overnight funding, the fed funds rate is generally lower than the LIBOR. This difference is due to the low-risk nature of U.S. bank deposits versus foreign bank deposits. U.S. bank deposits are covered by deposit insurance up to certain levels. Moreover, there is a perception that large U.S. banks and large U.S. bank depositors are implicitly insured via TBTF guarantees. Such guarantees lower U.S. bank risk and thus the cost of borrowing in the fed funds market. Foreign banks have no such explicit or implicit guarantees. Further, remember from Chapter 4 that the Federal Reserve sets the fed funds rate as it implements monetary policy. Thus, the fed funds rate is affected not just by the demand for interbank lending, but also by the Fed's actions. Note from Figure 5-9 that the fed funds rate sometimes exceeds the LIBOR rate. As noted previously, the increased demand for Eurodollars relative to fed funds as a source of overnight funding has, at times, outweighed the effect of the deposit insurance and "too big to fail" (or TBTF) guarantees. The result is that the fed funds rate has, at times, risen above the LIBOR rate.

Note, too, from Figure 5-9 that during the financial crisis the LIBOR rate spiked significantly, while the fed funds rate did not. The first spike occurred in the summer of 2007. In June and July, two Bear Stearns hedge funds required assistance, and Countrywide, one of the largest subprime mortgage originators, announced unexpectedly large losses. Then in August 2007, the asset-backed securities market dried up when several issuers failed to provide liquidity to support funding of securitized assets financed with short-term commercial paper. In response to the decline in asset values and an increase in concerns about bank solvency, the interbank market began to freeze. To prevent trouble in the financial markets, the Fed kept the fed funds rate low. The result was that the LIBOR rate rose especially sharply, while the fed funds rate did not. For example, the spread between the LIBOR and fed funds rates was 0.03 percent on July 26, 2007, 1.28 percent on August 10, 2007, and 1.76 percent on December 31, 2007.

Conditions improved following the bailout of Bear Stearns. The cost of funds to banks fell, as did the spread between the LIBOR and fed funds rates. In the summer of 2008, however, mortgage foreclosures continued to rise, leading to further downgrades of mortgage-backed securities by the credit rating agencies and the acceleration of losses to holders of those securities. Losses on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities eventually led to the failure of several financial institutions, most notably during the week of September 15, 2008, in which both AIG (technically) and Lehman Brothers failed. The demise of AIG and Lehman massively increased the demand for funding liquidity across the whole financial system. Panic soon spread globally and overnight borrowing rates jumped. However, the Fed again stepped in and lowered the fed funds rate (to between 0 and 0.25 percent) and expanded insurance on bank deposits. Public capital was also injected into all of the large banks in an attempt to allay fears about insolvency. The result was a huge spike in the spread between the LIBOR and fed funds rates. At the height of the crisis, the spread jumped to about 4 percent.

One of the more grievous actions by some global investment banks during the financial crisis was the manipulation of the LIBOR. LIBOR is the average of the interest rates submitted by major banks in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom in a variety of major currencies such as the dollar, euro, and yen. The scandal arose when it was discovered that banks had been manipulating the LIBOR rate so as to make either profits on its derivative positions (such as interest rate swaps) or to make the bank look stronger for reputational reasons. It is estimated that the banks involved made at least  \$75 billion on the manipulations. The In the News box in this chapter looks at allegations associated with the manipulation of the LIBOR during the financial crisis. The scandal became widely public in June 2012 when British investment bank Barclays agreed to pay\$ 450 million to settle allegations by U.S. and British authorities that some of its traders attempted to manipulate LIBOR rates to increase the bank's profits and reduce concerns about its stability during the financial crisis.

Concerns were also raised about the failure of British and U.S. regulators to stop the manipulation of LIBOR when there was evidence that both were aware of it. In July 2012, a former trader stated that LIBOR manipulation had been occurring since at least 1991. In July 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released documents dated as far back as 2007 showing that it knew that banks were misreporting their borrowing costs when setting LIBOR. Yet, no action was taken. Similarly, documents from the Bank of England indicated that the bank knew as early as November 2007 that the LIBOR rate was being manipulated. It was not until June 2012 that Barclays became the first bank to agree to settle LIBOR manipulation allegations. In late 2012, eight global financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, were fined  \$2.32 billion by the European Union regulators for alleged collusion in fixing the LIBOR rate. In December 2012, UBS agreed to pay about\$ 1.5 billion to settle charges that it manipulated LIBOR. Also in December, the U.S. Justice Department charged Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, with conspiracy to commit fraud by manipulating the LIBOR (in June 2013, he was charged with eight counts of fraud as part of the UK investigation). In February 2013, the Royal Bank of Scotland also decided to settle at a cost of 610 million. In early 2013, Deutsche Bank stated that it had set aside money to cover potential fines associated with its role in the manipulation of the LIBOR. While several big banks pleaded guilty to and accepted penalties for manipulating LIBOR, the first criminal conviction of an individual

##### Traders Influenced LIBOR Rates

In February of 2012, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that an anonymous bank tipped off Canadian financial regulators, informing them that a group of brokers and traders had "successfully managed to manipulate key interbank lending rates that affect loans around the world." In an official Canadian court filing, Canada's Competition Bureau noted that the unnamed bank confirmed that the actions of the accused did in fact result in changes to interest rates. The *Journal* cited sources claiming the anonymous institution was UBS AG, a Swiss bank that had been granted immunity in Switzerland for cooperating in an investigation of potential manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.

Though no specific banks or individuals had yet to be charged, court documents showed that traders on the yen LIBOR panel influenced the rates. Those traders came from six key banks: Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS. The Journal cites court documents explaining that the traders used emails and messaging to indicate whether they wanted to "see a higher or lower yen LIBOR to aid their trading position" and then entered into collusive agreements to submit artificially high or low quotes. However, the Journal clarified, "not all attempts to affect LIBOR submissions were successful."


Canada's Competition Bureau participated in a wider global investigation of certain financial firms to determine how those banks and others set the key interbank lending rates. They also looked into claims that the traders conspired with others are interbank broker firms. The Canadian regulator noted that two London-based interdealer brokers, RP Martin Holdings Ltd and ICAP PVLC, were also under investigation. Since late 2010, regulators led investigations on the banks that help set LIBOR and TIBOR in London and Tokyo; those rates are used to set the interest rates for hundreds of trillions of dollars of securities. According to the Financial Times, "More than a dozen traders and brokers in London and Asia have been fired, suspended or put on leave as part of the probe."

Former bank trader Tom Hayes was sentenced to 14 years in prison after a London jury convicted him of trying to fraudulently rig the LIBOR. The unanimous jury verdict delivered one of the harshest penalties against a banker since the financial crisis. Finally, in 2016 U.S. and British regulators fined six major global banks (Barclays, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Bank of America) a total of nearly 6 billion for rigging the foreign exchange market and LIBOR interest rates. Foreign exchange traders from the banks had met in online chatroom groups, one brazenly named "the Cartel" and another "Mafia," to set rates that cheated customers while adding to their own profits.


Following the 2012 rate-fixing scandals, regulators and policymakers undertook a review of financial benchmarks. During this process, they recognized that the decline in unsecured interbank borrowing threatened the steadfastness of LIBOR: nearly  \$200 trillion worth of derivatives, loans, securities and mortgages referenced a benchmark derived from just\$ 500 million in average in daily trading volumes as of year-end 2016. In his July 2017 speech, Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), spoke of a currency-tenor combination where submitting banks "executed just fifteen transactions of potentially qualifying size in that currency and tenor in the whole of 2016." In 2017, the FCA—which sanctions the panel of large banks that help set LIBOR—has declared that it can only commit to publishing the rate until the end of 2021. After that time, banks can drop out of the panel, and if too many choose that path, LIBOR could simply cease to exist or carry on in a diminished fashion.

Working groups convened by regulators in the most used LIBOR currencies have already converged on alternative reference rates. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) was charged by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2014 with selecting a new risk-free benchmark for use in the USD derivatives market. In 2017, the ARRC selected Secured Overnight Financing

Rate (SOFR) as a successor to USD LIBOR and the New York Fed began publishing the daily SOFR since April 3, 2018. While LIBOR is an unsecured reference rate submitted by panel banks with different maturities and built-in credit risk, SOFR is an overnight, secured reference rate administered by the New York Fed that broadly measures the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities (i.e., the repo market). According to the New York Fed, over 800 billion of daily transactions are executed in the U.S. Treasury overnight repo market, dwarfing the current volumes underlying LIBOR. Even though other reference rates were considered, the ARRC ultimately chose SOFR because it is wholly transaction-based and reflects the cost of secured financing across a variety of market participants (e.g., money market funds, asset managers, corporates, insurance companies, securities lenders, and pension funds) rather than just the interbank market. The ARRC released its Paced Transition Plan in March 2018, which envisioned a production of a forward-looking term rate by the end of 2021.

Eurodollar Certificates of Deposit. Eurodollar certificates of deposit (CDs) are U.S. dollar-denominated CDs in foreign banks. Maturities on Eurodollar CDs are less than one year, and most have a maturity of one week to six months. Because these securities are deposited in non-U.S. banks, Eurodollar CDs are not subject to reserve requirements in the same manner as U.S. deposits (although the reserve requirement on U.S. CDs was set to zero at the beginning of 1991).

Figure 5-10 shows the difference between three-month Eurodollar and U.S. bank-issued CDs from 1971 through 2019. As can be seen in this figure, prior to the 1990s, the Eurodollar CD paid consistently higher interest rates than U.S. CDs. In the 1990s, after the reserve requirement on CDs was set to zero, it is difficult to distinguish the Eurodollar CD

rate from the U.S. CD rate. Indeed, in 2007, the average rate paid on three-month Eurodollar CDs was 5.52 percent and on three-month U.S. CDs the average rate paid was 5.49 percent. Note, however, that during the financial crisis, Eurodollar CD rates rose above U.S. CD rates. In October 2008, the Eurodollar CD rate (5.31 percent) was 0.99 percent higher than the U.S. CD rate (4.32 percent). This difference was again due to the low-risk nature of U.S. bank deposits relative to foreign bank deposits. Following the crisis, rates on U.S. CDs and Eurodollar CDs have become close again.

Eurocommercial Paper. Eurocommercial paper (Euro-CP) is an unsecured, short-term loan issued by a bank or corporation in the international money market, denominated in a currency that differs from the domestic currency of the market where the paper is issued. An example would be Eurodollar commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars but issued in the Japanese debt market with a short time remaining until maturity. The Eurocommercial paper rate is generally benchmarked to the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA). According to the CMP Portal, there were $523.2 billion Eurocommercial paper outstanding and $435.9 billion Eurodollar certificates of deposit outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

## Summary

In this chapter, we reviewed money markets, which are markets that trade debt securities with original maturities of one year or less. The need for money markets arises because cash receipts do not always coincide with cash expenditures for individuals, corporations, and government units. Because holding cash involves an opportunity cost, holders of excess cash invest these funds in money market securities. We looked at the various money market securities available to short-term investors and the major borrowers and issuers of each. We also outlined the processes by which each of these securities are issued and traded in secondary markets. We concluded the chapter by examining international issues involving money markets, taking a particular look at Euro money markets.
