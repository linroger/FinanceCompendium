Bond markets are markets in which bonds are issued and traded. They are used to assist in the transfer of funds from individuals, corporations, and government units with excess funds to corporations and government units in need of long-term debt funding. Bond markets are traditionally classified into three types: (1) Treasury notes and bonds, (2) municipal bonds, and (3) corporate bonds. Figure 6-1 shows the distribution of each type outstanding in 1994 and 2018. In Chapter 3, we applied time value of money principles to the valuation and duration of bonds, paying particular attention to the change in a bond's value when interest rates change. We also examined how characteristics specific to a bond (e.g., coupon rate and remaining time to maturity) influence its price. In this chapter we look at the characteristics of the various bond securities (including the trading process in bond markets), the participants in the bond markets, and international bond markets and securities.

## Bond Market Securities

## LG 6-2

## Treasury notes (T-notes) and bonds (T-bonds)

Long-term securities issued by the U.S. Treasury to finance the national debt and other federal government expenditures.

Government units and corporations are the major bond security issuers. Figure 6-1 shows that the dollar amount of bond securities outstanding by these groups has increased from $6.2 trillion in 1994 to $30.4 trillion in 2018. Much of this increase occurred between 2007 and 2018 during the depths of the financial crisis as bond markets grew by more than 11 trillion. Historically low rates on debt during this period were a major reason for the boom in bond markets. In this section, we look at the bond market securities issued by each of these groups: Treasury notes and bonds, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.

## Treasury Notes and Bonds

Treasury notes (T-notes) and bonds (T-bonds) are issued by the U.S. Treasury to finance the national debt and other federal government expenditures (13.2 trillion outstanding in 2018). The national debt (ND) reflects the historical accumulation of annual federal government deficits or expenditures (G) minus taxes (T) over the last 200-plus years, as follows:

$$
N D_{t} = \sum_{t = 1}^{N} \left(G_{t} - T_{t}\right)
$$

Figure 6-2 shows the composition of the U.S. national debt from 1994 through 2019. Notice that over this period, approximately 40 to 60 percent of the U.S. national debt consisted of Treasury notes and bonds. Notice also that as the U.S. economy boomed in the late 1990s and the U.S. budget deficit shrank, the amount of public debt outstanding in the form of U.S. Treasury securities decreased from a year-end high of $3.10 trillion in 1994 (52.5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product [GDP]) to $2.97 trillion in 2000 (29.8 percent of GDP). While the amount of Treasury securities grew through the 2000s, so did economic growth. The level of outstanding U.S. Treasury securities grew to $4.7 trillion by June 2008 (32.9 percent of GDP). During the financial crisis, the U.S. government used Treasury securities in its attempts to stimulate the economy (see Chapter 4) and the national debt ballooned to $16.7 trillion—11.4 trillion of which was Treasury securities (representing 71.3 percent of GDP).

Like T-bills, T-notes and bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are, therefore, default risk free. As a result, T-notes and bonds pay relatively low rates of interest (yields to maturity) to investors. T-notes and bonds, however, are not completely risk free. Given their longer maturity (i.e., duration), these instruments experience wider price fluctuations than do money market instruments as interest rates change (and thus are subject to interest rate risk—see Chapter 23). Further, many of the older issued bonds and notes—"off the run" issues—may be less liquid than newly issued bonds and notes—"on the run" issues—in which case they may bear an additional premium for illiquidity risk.

In contrast to T-bills, which are sold on a discount basis from face value (see Chapter 5), T-notes and T-bonds pay coupon interest (semiannually). Further, T-bills have an original maturity of one year or less. Treasury notes have original maturities from over 1 to 10 years, while T-bonds have original maturities from over 10 years. T-notes and bonds are issued in minimum denominations of $100, or in multiples of $100. The Treasury issues two types of notes and bonds: fixed principal and inflation-indexed. While both types pay interest twice a year, the principal value used to determine the percentage interest payment (coupon) on inflation-indexed bonds is adjusted to reflect inflation (measured by the consumer price index). Thus, the semiannual coupon payments and the final principal payment are based on the inflation-adjusted principal value of the security (see below).

Like T-bills, once issued T-notes and T-bonds trade in very active secondary markets. Table 6-1 presents part of a T-note and T-bond (including Treasury STRIPS—see below) closing price/interest yield quote sheet from The Wall Street Journal for trading on May 23, 2016. Column 1 is the date the note or bond matures. Column 2 in the table lists the coupon rate on the Treasury security. Note that coupon rates are set at intervals of 0.125 (or  $\frac{1}{8}$  of 1) percent. Column 3, labeled Bid, is the close of the day selling price (in percentage terms) available to T-note and bond holders (i.e., the price dealers are willing to pay T-note and bond holders for their Treasury securities). Prices are quoted as percentages of the face value on the Treasury security. For example, using a face value of 1,000, the bid price on the 0.875 percent coupon, February 2017 T-note was

# STRIPS

A Treasury security in which the periodic interest payment is separated from the final principal payment.

1,001.641 (100.1641% × $1,000). Column 4, labeled Asked, is the close of the day purchase price available to investors. Column 5, labeled Chg, is the change in the asked price from the previous day's close—that is, the February 2017 T-note's price was 0.0313 percent lower than the previous day's close (100.2110 percent). Finally, the last column, labeled Asked Yield, is the asked price converted into a yield to maturity on the T-note or T-bond. This yield is calculated using the yield to maturity formulas found in Chapter 3—it is the interest rate or yield (using semiannual compounding) that makes the price of the security just equal to the present value of the expected coupon and face value cash flows on the bond (where this yield is the single discount rate that makes this equality hold).

STRIPS. In 1985, the Treasury began issuing 10-year notes and 30-year bonds² to financial institutions using a book-entry system under a program titled Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS). A STRIPS is a Treasury security in which periodic coupon interest payments can be separated from each other and from the final principal payment. As illustrated in Figure 6-3, a STRIPS effectively creates two sets of securities—one set for each semiannual interest payment and one for the final principal payment. Each of the components of the STRIPS are often referred to as "Treasury zero bonds" or "Treasury zero-coupon bonds" because investors in the individual components receive only the single stripped payments (e.g., the third semiannual coupon) in which they invest. Investors needing a lump sum payment in the distant future (e.g., life insurers) would prefer to hold the principal portion of the STRIPS. Investors wanting nearer-term cash flows (e.g., commercial banks) would prefer the interest portions of the STRIPS. Also, some state lotteries invest the present value of large lottery prizes in STRIPS to be sure that funds are available to meet required annual payments to lottery winners. Pension funds purchase STRIPS to match payment cash flows received on their assets (STRIPS) with those required on their liabilities (pension contract payments).

STRIPS were created by the U.S. Treasury in response to the separate trading of Treasury security principal and interest that had been developed by securities firms. Specifically, in the early 1980s, Merrill Lynch introduced Treasury Investment Growth Receipts (TIGRs). Merrill Lynch purchased Treasury securities, stripped them into one security representing the principal component only and a separate security for each coupon payment, and put these individual securities up for resale. The Treasury's creation of the STRIPS was meant to offer a competitive product to the market.

The U.S. Treasury does not issue STRIPS directly to investors. Rather, stripped Treasury notes and bonds may be purchased only through financial institutions and government securities brokers and dealers, who create the STRIPS components after purchasing the original T-notes or T-bonds (whole) in Treasury auctions (see below). After the STRIPS components have been created, by requesting that the Treasury separate each coupon and face value payment on each bond and recording them as separate securities in its book-entry computer system, they can be sold individually in the secondary markets.

Figure 6-3 Creation of a Treasury STRIP

2. The U.S. Treasury stopped issuing 30-year bonds between 2001 and 2006.

**Example 6-1 Creation of a STRIPS**

Suppose the Treasury issues a five-year T-note with a par value of $10,000 and an 8 percent coupon rate (paid semiannually, or $400 is paid to the holder every six months for the next five years) to Citigroup. Citigroup decides to convert the bond into a set of stripped securities by requesting the Treasury to separate the coupons and face value of the note into separate securities on its computer system (basically giving each coupon and face value a separate I.D. or CUSIP number). This means that Citigroup can then sell 11 different securities: 10 securities associated with each of the semiannual coupon payments of $400 and one that pays $10,000 (the face or principal value) in five years to outside investors. We show the value of each of these securities in Table 6-2, assuming the yield to maturity on each of the stripped securities is 7.90 percent and is the same as the bond sold "whole."

Notice that the total present value of the 11 different securities involved with the STRIPS is the same as that of the original T-note before it is stripped, 10,040.65. However, in general, the bank (Citigroup) will try to sell the 11 stripped securities for a greater total present value than the bond as a whole. The reason for this is that many investors desire particular maturity zero-coupon bonds to meet investment goals and needs. Such goals and needs (such as duration targets—see below) are often harder to achieve through buying whole T-notes or T-bonds. Consequently, investors are willing to pay a higher price and thus accept a yield lower than 7.90 percent on the stripped investments. As a result, the total price Citigroup would get from selling the 11 STRIPS would exceed 10,040.65.

As mentioned previously, STRIPS are attractive investments to investors desiring particular maturity zero-coupon bonds to meet investment goals and needs. For example, STRIPS are used as investment securities for individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans, and pension funds. Frequently, managers of these types of financial institutions face the problem of structuring their asset investments so they can pay a given cash amount to policyholders in some future period.

3. Once a bond is stripped, if an investor purchases each coupon and face value component at a later time, he or she can ask the Treasury to reconstitute the original bond on its computer system. Thus, the Treasury STRIPS program is highly flexible and STRIPS can be reconstituted as whole bonds.

policyholders in some future period. The classic example of this is an insurance policy that pays the holder some lump sum when the holder reaches retirement age. The risk to the life insurance company manager is that interest rates on the funds generated from investing the holder's premiums could fall. Thus, the accumulated returns on the premiums invested might not meet the target or promised amount. In effect, the insurance company would be forced to draw down its reserves and net worth to meet its payout commitments. (See Chapter 15 for a discussion of this risk.) To immunize or protect itself against interest rate risk, the insurer can invest in Treasury zero-coupon bonds (or STRIPS).

# EXAMPLE 6-2 Using a STRIPS to Immunize against Interest Rate Risk

Suppose that it is 2022 and an insurer must make a guaranteed payment to an investor in five years, 2027. For simplicity, we assume that this target guaranteed payment is  \$1,480,000, a lump sum policy payout on retirement, equivalent to investing\$ 1,000,000 at a semiannually compounded rate of 8 percent over five years.

To immunize or protect itself against interest rate risk, the insurer needs to determine which investments would produce a cash flow of exactly  \$1,480,000 in five years, regardless of what happens to interest rates in the immediate future. By investing in a five-year maturity (and duration) Treasury zero-coupon bond (or STRIPS), the insurance company would produce a\$ 1,480,000 cash flow in five years, no matter what happens to interest rates in the immediate future.

Given a  \$1,000 face value and an 8 percent yield and assuming annual compounding, the current price per five-year STRIPS is\$ 675.56 per bond:

$$
P = 6 7 5. 5 6 = \frac{1 , 0 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 8 / 2)^{2 \times 5}}
$$

If the insurer buys 1,480 of these bonds at a total cost of  \$1,000,000 in 2022, these investments would produce\$ 1,480,000 on maturity in five years. The reason is that the duration of this bond portfolio exactly matches the target horizon for the insurer's future liability to its policyholders. Intuitively, since the STRIPS pays no intervening cash flows or coupons, future changes in interest rates have no reinvestment income effect. Thus, the return would be unaffected by intervening interest rate changes.

Most T-note and T-bond issues are eligible for the STRIPS program. The components of a STRIPS are sold with minimum face values of  \$100 and in increasing multiples of$ 100 (e.g., $200, \$300). Thus, the par amount of the securities must be an amount that will produce semiannual coupon payments of \$100 or a multiple of \$100. The original Treasury note and bond issues that are eligible for the STRIPS program are usually limited to those with large par values.

The T-note and T-bond quote list in Table 6-1 includes a portion of the Treasury STRIPS that traded on May 23, 2016. The quote first lists principal value stripped from Treasury bonds, second is the principal value stripped from Treasury notes, and finally the coupon payments stripped from both Treasury bonds and Treasury notes. Look at the row for Treasury bond, stripped principal, maturing in May 2017. The first column of the quote lists the date the STRIPS matures (e.g., 2017 May 15). Columns 2 and 3 list the bid and asked prices for the STRIPS. Like the quote for other Treasury securities (discussed above), the bid is the close of the day selling price (in percentage terms) available to STRIPS holders (i.e., the price dealers are willing to pay T-note and bond holders for their Treasury securities). Prices are quoted as percentages of the face value on the Treasury security. The asked price is the close of the day purchase price available to investors. Column 4, labeled Chg, is the change in the asked price from the previous day's close. Finally, the last column, labeled Asked Yield, is the asked price converted into a yield to maturity on the STRIPS. This yield is calculated using the yield to maturity formulas found in Chapter 3. That is, it is the interest rate or yield (using semiannual compounding to correspond with the semiannual coupon payments that are "stripped" from each other and the final principal payment) that makes the price of the security just equal to the present value of the expected coupon or face value cash flows on the STRIPS.

# EXAMPLE 6-3 Calculation of Yield on a STRIPS

For the principal STRIPS maturing in May 2017 (reported in Table 6-1), the asked price at the close on Monday, May 23, 2016 (or present value), is 99.244 percent. Settlement occurs one business day after purchase, so you receive actual ownership on Wednesday, May 24, 2016. When the STRIPS matures, on May 15, 2017 (in 0.97534247 year), the STRIPS holder will receive 100 percent of the face value (or future value). Using semiannual compounding, the yield to maturity  $(ytm)$ , or asked yield is calculated as:

$$
100 \% = 99.244 \% (1 + ytm / 2)^{2 \times 97534247}
$$

Solving for  $ytm$ , we get:

$$ y t m = 0.78 \%
$$

Treasury Note and Bond Yields. Treasury note and bond yields to maturities and prices are calculated using the bond valuation formulas presented in Chapter 3. The general bond valuation formula is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V_{b} = \frac{I N T}{m} \sum_{t = 1}^{m N} \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{r_{b}}{m}}\right)^{t} + \frac{M}{\left(1 + \frac{r_{b}}{m}\right)^{m N}} \\ = \frac{I N T}{m} \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{r_{b}}{m}\right)^{m N}} \\ \hline \frac{r_{b}}{m} \end{array} \right] + M \left[ \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{r_{b}}{m}\right)^{m N}} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$ where


$V_{b} =$  Present value of the bond

$M = \mathrm{Par}$  or face value of the bond

INT = Annual interest (or coupon) payment on the bond equals the par value times the coupon rate

$N =$  Number of years until the bond matures

$m =$  Number of times per year interest is paid

$r_b =$  Interest rate used to discount cash flows on the bond

The bond value calculated from this general formula is the price (also referred to as the clean price) quoted in the financial press.

# EXAMPLE 6-4 Calculation of a T-Note Price from a Wall Street Journal Online Quote

In Table 6-1, look at the T-note outstanding on Monday, May 23, 2016 (or a settlement date of Wednesday, May 24, 2016), with a maturity on November 30, 2017 (i.e., they were 1.52328767 years from maturity). The T-note had a coupon rate of 0.625 percent and an

$$ asked yield of 0.853 percent. Using the bond valuation formula, the asked price on the bond should have been:

$$

The asked quote reported in The Wall Street Journal Online was indeed 99.6858.

# accrued interest

That portion of the coupon payment accrued between the last coupon payment and the settlement day.

Accrued Interest. When an investor buys a T-note or T-bond between coupon payments, the buyer must compensate the seller for that portion of the coupon payment accrued between the last coupon payment and the settlement day (normally, settlement takes place 1 day after a trade), while the seller was still the owner of the security. This amount is called accrued interest. Accrued interest on a T-note or T-bond is based on the actual number of days the bond was held by the seller since the last coupon payment:

$$

\text{Ac cr ue di nt er es t} = \frac{I N T}{2} \times \frac{\text{Ac tu al nu mb er of da ys si nc el as tc ou po np ay me nt}}{\text{Ac tu al nu mb er of da ys in co up on pe ri od}}

$$

At settlement, the buyer must pay the seller the purchase price of the T-note or T-bond plus accrued interest. The sum of these two is often called the full price or dirty price of the security. The price without the accrued interest added on is called the clean price. In the United States, it is market practice that newspapers list bond quotes on a clean price basis. Then, when a bond trade is settled, the accrued interest is added to the value based on the clean price of the bond. Thus, bond price quotes are typically the clean prices, but buyers of bonds pay the dirty, or full, price.

# EXAMPLE 6-5 Calculation of Accrued Interest and Yield to Maturity on a Bond

On August 5, 2019, you purchase a  $10,000 T$ -note that matures on May 15, 2025 (settlement occurs one day after purchase, so you receive actual ownership of the bond on August 6, 2019). The coupon rate on the T-note is 5.875 percent and the current price quoted on the bond in the financial press is 101.3437. The last coupon payment occurred on May 15, 2019 (82 days before settlement), and the next coupon payment will be paid on November 15, 2019 (102 days from settlement). We illustrate this time line in Figure 6-4.

The accrued interest due to the seller from the buyer at settlement is calculated as:

$$

(5.875\% /2)\times 82 / 184 = 1.3251\%

$$ of the face value of the bond, or 130.91. The dirty price of this transaction, or the full price paid by the bond buyer, is:


$$

\text{Cl an} + \text{Ac cr ue di nt er es t} = \text{Di rt yp e}

$$

$$
101.3437\% + 1.3091\% = 102.6528\%
$$ of the face value of the bond, or  $10,265.28 per$ 10,000 face value bond.

Figure 6-5 Dirty Price of Treasury Note

Notice that as the purchase date approaches the coupon interest payment date, the accrued interest due to the seller from the buyer increases. Just before a coupon payment date the buyer pays the seller fractionally less than the full coupon payment. However, as the accrued interest portion of the dirty price of the note increases, the clean price of the note decreases to offset this, keeping the overall price of the note to the buyer constant. This is illustrated in Figure 6-5.

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). In January 1997, the U.S. Treasury began issuing inflation-indexed bonds called Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which provide returns tied to the inflation rate. By June 2019, the outstanding value of TIPS was over 1.4 trillion. Like the fixed-coupon bonds issued by the Treasury, the coupon rate on TIPS is determined by the auction process described below. However, unlike the fixed-principal bonds, the principal value of a TIPS bond can increase (or decrease) every six months by the amount of U.S. inflation (or deflation) as measured by the percentage change in the consumer price index (CPI). This principal is called the inflation-adjusted principal. TIPS bonds are used by investors who wish to earn a rate of return on their investments that keeps up with the inflation rate over time.

# EXAMPLE 6-6 Calculation of Inflation-Adjusted Principal Values and Coupon Payments on TIPS

To see how TIPS bonds work, consider an investor who, on January 1, 2022, purchases a TIPS bond with an original principal of 100,000, a 4 percent annual (or 2 percent semiannual) coupon rate, and 10 years to maturity. The inflation-adjusted principal at the end of the first six months, on June 30, 2022, is found by multiplying the original par value

(\ 100,000) by the semiannual inflation rate. Thus, if the semiannual inflation rate during the first six months is 0.5 percent, the principal amount used to determine the first coupon payment is adjusted upward by 0.5 percent:

$$
\$ 100,000 \times 1.005 = \$ 100,500
$$

Therefore, the first coupon payment, paid on June 30, 2022, is calculated as:

$$
\$ 100,500 \times 2.0\% = \$ 2,010
$$

The inflation-adjusted principal at the beginning of the second six months is 100,500. Suppose that the semiannual inflation rate for the second six-month period is 1 percent. Then the inflation-adjusted principal at the end of the second six months (on December 31, 2022), and the principal amount used to determine the second coupon payment, is adjusted upward by 1 percent:

$$
\$ 100,500 \times 1.01 = \$ 101,505
$$

The coupon payment to the investor for the second six-month period is the inflation-adjusted principal on this coupon payment date (101,505) times the semiannual coupon rate (2 percent). Or on December 31, 2022, the investor receives a coupon payment of:

$$
\$ 101,505 \times 2.0\% = \$ 2,030.10
$$

The TIPS yield may be viewed as a real yield, and the spread between the yields of TIPS and non-TIPS of the same maturity is the market's consensus estimate of average annual inflation over the period. While TIPS may appear attractive to investors fearing inflation, the yields are lower. Further, the periodic principal adjustments are taxable as interest. Thus, while TIPS may provide a large payoff at maturity (due to an increase in the principal value) they may end up being negative cash-flow securities for taxable investors in some periods. Consequently, TIPS may not be an appropriate investment for someone looking for significant current income.

Primary and Secondary Market Trading in Treasury Notes and Bonds. As in primary market T-bill sales, the U.S. Treasury sells T-notes and T-bonds through competitive and noncompetitive Treasury auctions (see Chapter 5). Table 6-3 shows a recent auction pattern for new T-note and T-bond issues. The Treasury issues a press release about a week before each auction announcing the details of the auction, including the auction date, the amount to be sold, and other details about the securities to be issued (see the In the News box).

Bids may be submitted by government securities dealers, businesses, and individuals through the TreasuryDirect website until noon Eastern time for noncompetitive bids and 1 p.m. Eastern time for competitive bids on the day of the auction. Bidders submit the yield to maturities they are willing to accept (in increments of 0.001 percent). Awards are announced the following day. The auction is a single-price auction—all bidders pay the same price, which is the price associated with the highest of the competitive yields bid. At each auction,

Source: U.S. Treasury website, TreasuryDirect, January 2, 2020, www.treasurydirect.gov first noncompetitive bids are filled. Next, competitive bids are ranked from the lowest to highest yield (a bidder willing to accept the lowest yield is willing to pay the highest price). The stop-out yield of the auction is the highest accepted yield. The bids at the stop-out yield are filled on a pro-rata basis, and all the bids above the stop-out yield are rejected.[5]

So far, the procedure described is the same as the one for T-bill auctions. The differences arise because notes and bonds are coupon-bearing instruments. The coupon rate of the auctioned notes or bonds is the stop-out yield rounded down to the nearest 1/8 percent

5. Similar to Treasury bill auctions (discussed in Chapter 5), this single-price auction process went into effect in 1998. Prior to this, the Treasury used a discriminatory auction process.

(unless it already falls on 1/8 percent). Recall that coupon rates are set in increments of one-eighth of 1 percent. The security's price is set for the yield to maturity to equal the auction's stop-out yield. Because the coupon rate is the stop-out yield rounded down, the coupon rate is usually below the stop-out yield, meaning that the price is usually slightly below par. This process helps ensure that successful bidders will not pay more than the par value of the requested bonds. In Treasury auction result announcements, the stop-out yield is called "high yield" and the coupon rate is called "interest rate." Negative yields cannot be bid in the auctions for non-inflation-protected Treasuries, but are allowed (and have happened) in TIPS auctions. A negative yield on TIPS implies that investors are willing to accept a negative real return on their investment. TIPS first traded with a negative yield in late 2010. Remember that the yield on a TIPS bond is equal to the Treasury bond yield minus the rate of expected inflation. As was the case in late 2010, when non-inflation-protected Treasury bonds trade at yields below the expected inflation rate, TIPS yields became negative.

Table 6-4 shows the results of the 10-year T-note auction of January 8, 2020. At this auction, 40.86 percent (or 24,000,033,700) of the submitted bids (58,742,570,300) were accepted. Further, 0.02 percent (4,095,300) of the accepted bids at the January 8, 2020, Treasury auction were noncompetitive. Figure 6-6 illustrates the auction results for the 10-year T-notes. The lowest yield bid on the 10-year T-notes was 1.700 percent (or a high price of 100.4580260 percent of the face value of the T-notes). Bids were filled at yields above the low (prices below the high). The highest yield bid was 1.869 percent (or a low price of 98.9191752 percent). At this price, all 24,000,033,700 in 10-year T-notes offered were sold. All bidders who submitted yields below 1.869 percent (prices above 98.9191752 percent, categories 1 through 5 in Figure 6-6) were awarded in full (winning bids) at the low price (i.e., 98.9191752 percent). Bidders who submitted a yield above 1.869 percent (price below 98.9191752 percent categories 7 and beyond in Figure 6-6) received no allocation of the auctioned T-notes. A portion, but not all, of the bids submitted at 98.9191752 were filled (category 6 in Figure 6-6). These bids are filled pro rata at this price. For example, if total bids in category 6 were 100 million, but only 25 million in notes remained to be allocated to competitive bidders (given the S_{C} supply curve in Figure 6-6), each bidder would receive 25 percent of his or her bid quantity at this price. All of the 4,095,300 noncompetitive bids were filled at a price of 98.9191752 percent (which is equal to the low price paid by the winning competitive bidders).

Most secondary market trading of Treasury notes and bonds occurs directly through broker and dealer trades (see Chapters 5 and 16). For example, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average daily trading volume in T-note and T-bond issues for the month ended December 2019, was 523.2 billion. The Treasury quotes in Table 6-1 show just a small number of the Treasury securities that traded on May 23, 2016. The full quote listed in The Wall Street Journal Online shows the hundreds of different Treasury securities that trade daily.

## Municipal Bonds

## municipal bonds

Securities issued by state and local (e.g., county, city, school) governments.

Municipal bonds are securities issued by state and local (e.g., county, city, school) governments (3.8 trillion outstanding in the third quarter of 2019) either to fund temporary imbalances between operating expenditures and receipts or to finance long-term capital outlays for activities such as school construction, public utility construction, or transportation systems. Tax receipts or revenues generated from a project are the source of repayment on municipal bonds.

6. However, there is one exception to this procedure. If the stop-out rate of a T-note or T-bond auction is below 0.125 percent, the annual coupon rate is set at 0.125 percent and the price that all successful bidders pay will be above par. This rule was enacted in April 2011; before then, the coupon rate would be set at zero.
 7. Note: The stop-out yield of the auction is 1.869 percent (the highest accepted yield). The annual coupon rate of the auction bonds is 1.750 percent (1.869 percent rounded down to the nearest 1/8 percent). For this 10-year T-note, the price every successful bidder paid per \$100 of par is \$98.9191752 (N = 10 × 2 = 20; I = 1.869/2 = 0.9345; PMT = 1.750/2 = 0.875, FV = 100; thus, CPT PV = 98.9191752).

Municipal bonds are attractive to household investors since interest payments on municipal bonds (but not capital gains) are exempt from federal income taxes and most state and local income taxes (in contrast, interest payments on Treasury securities are exempt only from state and local income taxes). As a result, the interest borrowing cost to the state or local government is lower, because investors are willing to accept lower interest rates on municipal bonds relative to comparable taxable bonds such as corporate bonds. Further, many municipal bonds are insured by a third party. Bond insurance ensures payment to bond holders in the event that the issuer defaults on a payment. Generally, the insurance company assuring a bond has a higher credit rating than the issuer. As a result, the bond issue will have the credit rating of the insurance company. This helps improve the credit ratings of bond issuers and lowers interest rates on bonds backed by insurance substantially. Bond insurance also increases the liquidity of bonds because it is easier to sell an insured bond on the market.

Figure 6-6 Treasury Auction Results

Municipal Bond Yields. To compare returns from tax-exempt municipal bonds with those on fully taxable corporate bonds, the after-tax (or equivalent tax-exempt) yield on a taxable bond can be calculated as follows:

$$ r_{a} = r_{b} (1 - t)
$$ where


$r_a =$  After-tax (equivalent tax-exempt) yield on a taxable corporate bond

$r_b =$  Before-tax yield on a taxable bond

$t =$  Marginal income tax rate of the bond holder (i.e., the sum of his or her marginal federal, state, and local taxes) $^8$

# EXAMPLE 6-7 Comparison of a Municipal Bond and a Fully Taxable Corporate Bond Rate

Suppose you can invest in taxable corporate bonds that are yielding a 10 percent annual interest rate or municipal bonds. If your marginal tax rate is 28 percent (i.e., the sum of federal, local, and state taxes on the last dollar of interest income), the after-tax or equivalent tax-exempt yield on the taxable bond is:

$$

10\% (1 - 0.28) = 7.2\%

$$

Thus, the comparable yield on municipal bonds of similar risk would be 7.2 percent.

Alternatively, the yield on a tax-exempt municipal bond can be used to determine the tax equivalent yield for a taxable security that would cause an investor to be just indifferent between the taxable and tax-exempt bonds of the same default and liquidity risks. Re-arranging the equation above,

$$ r_{b} = r_{a} / (1 - t)
$$

8. Treasury securities are not exempt from federal taxes but are exempt from state and local income taxes. Thus, the after-tax yield on a Treasury security is calculated as:

$$ r_{a} = r_{b} (1 - t_{f})
$$ where  $t_f =$  the marginal federal tax rate.


# EXAMPLE 6-8 Conversion of a Municipal Bond Rate to a Tax Equivalent Rate

You are considering an investment in a municipal bond that has a yield of  $r_a = 6.5$  percent annually. If your marginal tax rate  $(t)$  is 21 percent, the tax equivalent yield on this bond  $(r_b)$  is:

$$
8.223\% = 6.5\% /(1 - 0.21)
$$

# general obligation (GO) bonds

Bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer.

## revenue bonds

Bonds sold to finance a specific revenue-generating project, backed by cash flows from that project.

Two types of municipal bonds exist: general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. Table 6-5 shows the amount of both issued in 1990 through 2018. General obligation (GO) bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer—that is, the state or local government promises to use all of its financial resources (e.g., its taxation powers) to repay the bond. GO bonds generally have neither specific assets pledged as collateral backing the bond nor a specific revenue stream identified as a source of repayment of the bond's principal and interest. Because the taxing authority of the government issuer is promised to ensure repayment, the issuance of new GO bonds generally requires local taxpayer approval. Possibly because of this requirement, and taxpayers' reluctance to have their taxes increased, general obligation bonds represent a small portion of municipal bonds issued (30.6 percent in 2018).

Revenue bonds are sold to finance a specific revenue-generating project and are backed by cash flows from that project. For example, a revenue bond may be issued to finance an extension of a state highway. To help pay off the interest and principal on that bond, tolls collected from the use of the highway may be pledged as collateral. If revenue from the project is insufficient to pay interest and retire the bonds on maturity as promised—perhaps because motorists are reluctant to use the highway and pay the tolls—general tax revenues may not be used to meet these payments. Instead, the revenue bond goes into default and bond holders are not paid. Thus, revenue bonds are generally riskier than GO bonds.

Municipal bonds are typically issued in minimum denominations of 5,000. Although trading in these bonds is less active than that of Treasury bonds, a secondary market exists for municipal bonds. Table 6-6 lists a portion of a municipal bond quote sheet from The Wall Street Journal Online on May 23, 2016. Column 1 lists the (local) government issuer. Column 2 lists the coupon rate (generally paid semiannually) on the bond issue. Column 3, labeled Maturity, is the maturity date of the bond issue. Column 4, labeled Price, is the bond price in percentage terms (i.e., 119 \frac{3}{4} = 119.75 percent of the face value). Column 5, YTM, is the yield to maturity on the municipal bond based on the current selling price available to the municipal bond holder. As discussed above, these yields are not taxed at the federal, state, or local levels and thus are not comparable to corporate bond yields.

Municipal bonds are not default risk free. Defaults on municipal bonds peaked in 1990 at  \$1.4 billion, due mainly to a major economic recession in the United States. As the economy grew in the 1990s and early and mid-2000s, these defaults subsided. However, defaults on municipal debt increased dramatically during the recent financial crisis, from\$ 329 million in 2007 to \$8.2 billion in 2008, \$7.3 billion in 2009, 2.9 billion in 2010,

6.5 billion in 2011, and 4.8 billion in 2012. Defaults totaled only 278 million in the first quarter of 2013. However, they then soared to 6.68 billion as in June 2013. Detroit announced that it had suspended payments on its unsecured debt and the city declared bankruptcy, the largest U.S. city to ever do so. Even into 2014 defaults continued to rise, to 9.02 billion for the year. Municipal defaults stabilized in 2015. However, in May 2016 Puerto Rico defaulted on a \$270 million payment due on its municipal debt. This was just the start as, at the time, Puerto Rico had over \$70 billion in municipal debt outstanding. A payment of 1.9 billion was due in July 2016, for which Puerto Rico announced it did not have the funds to pay.

The island's debt crisis continued to deepen throughout 2016 and 2017, causing Title III bankruptcy process to begin in May 2017. The Title III provision allows for a court debt restructuring process akin to U.S. bankruptcy protection. Puerto Rico, as a U.S. territory, is barred from a traditional municipal bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. code. As Puerto Rico's overall debt burden is nearly seven times larger than Detroit's was when it entered bankruptcy, it became the largest municipal insolvency case in U.S. history.

Note from Table 6-5 that general obligation bonds issuances decreased from  \$130.5 billion in 2007 to\$ 96.0 billion in 2011, while revenue bonds issuances fell from  \$295.8 billion to\$ 224.2 billion. America's largest cities focused on debt management as a key component of protecting their fiscal health during and after the Great Recession. On the heels of a deep and prolonged economic decline, cities issued fewer new money bonds in 2011 than at any other point in the previous 22 years. As cities continued to face fiscal challenges in the recession's aftermath, they were reluctant to incur large amounts of new debt before their finances substantially recovered. Similarly, 2018 was one of the slowest years for municipal bond issuance. Due to the federal tax overhaul in December 2017, the elimination of so-called advanced refunding bonds reduced the overall supply of municipal bond offerings. In addition, the 2017 tax law gave banks less of an incentive to invest in municipal bonds. The law slashed the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. That, combined with rising interest rates, has made low-interest-rate municipal bonds less attractive to banks.

The Trading Process for Municipal Bonds. The initial (primary market) sale for municipal bonds (and corporate bonds, discussed below) occurs either through a public offering, using an investment bank serving as a security underwriter, or through a private

The issue of securities in which the investment bank does not guarantee a price to the issuer and acts more as a placing or distribution agent on a fee basis related to its success in placing the issue.

# private placement

A security issue placed with one or a few large institutional buyers.

placement to a small group of investors (often financial institutions). Generally, when a large state or local governmental unit issues principals to the public, many investment banks are interested in underwriting the bonds and the principals can generally be sold in a national market. As of 2018, there were approximately 1 million outstanding municipal securities, with around 40,000 daily trades and 11.6 billion in daily trading volume.

Firm Commitment Underwriting. Public offerings of municipal (and corporate, see below) bonds are most often made through an investment banking firm (see Chapter 16) serving as the underwriter. Normally, the investment bank facilitates this transfer using a firm commitment underwriting, illustrated in Figure 6-7. The investment bank guarantees the municipality (or corporation for a corporate bond) a price for newly issued bonds by buying the whole issue at a fixed price from the municipal issuer (the bid price). The investment bank then seeks to resell these securities to suppliers of funds (investors) at a higher price (the offer price). As a result, the investment bank takes a risk that it may not be able to resell the securities to investors at a higher price. This may occur if prices of municipal bonds suddenly fall due to an unexpected change in interest rates or negative information being released about the creditworthiness of the issuing municipality. If this occurs, the investment bank takes a loss on its underwriting of the security. However, the municipal issuer is protected by being able to sell the whole issue.

The investment bank can purchase the bonds through competitive bidding against other investment banks or through direct negotiation with the issuer. In a competitive sale, the issuer invites bids from a number of underwriters. The investment bank that submits the highest bid to the issuer wins the bid. The underwriter may use a syndicate of other underwriters and investment banks to distribute (sell) the issue to the public. Most state and local governments require a competitive municipal bond issue to be announced in a trade publication, such as the Bond Buyer. With a negotiated sale, the investment bank obtains the exclusive right to originate, underwrite, and distribute the new bonds through a one-on-one negotiation process. With a negotiated sale, the investment bank provides the origination and advising services to the issuers. Most states require that GO bonds be issued through competitive bids.

Best-Efforts Offering. Some municipal (and corporate) securities are offered on a best-efforts basis, in which the investment bank does not guarantee a firm price to the issuer (as with a firm commitment offering) and acts more as a placing or distribution agent for a fee. With best-efforts offerings, the investment bank incurs no risk of mispricing the security since it seeks to sell the bonds at the price it can get in the market. In return the investment bank receives a fee. Further, the investment bank offers the securities at a price originally set by the municipality. Thus, the investment bank does not incur the expense of establishing the market price for the customer. Often, knowing that the investment bank has not put any of its own funds into the issue, investors in best-efforts issues are not willing to pay as much for the bonds as with a firm commitment issue.

Private Placement. In a private placement, a municipality (or corporation), sometimes with the help of an investment bank, seeks to find a large institutional buyer or group of buyers (usually fewer than 10) to purchase the whole issue. To protect smaller individual investors against a lack of disclosure, the Security and Exchange Act of 1934 requires publicly traded securities to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Private placements, on the other hand, can be unregistered and can be resold only to large, financially sophisticated investors (see below). These large investors supposedly possess the resources and expertise to analyze a security's risk.

Privately placed bonds (and stocks) have traditionally been among the most illiquid securities in the bond market, with only the very largest financial institutions or institutional investors being able or willing to buy and hold them in the absence of an active secondary market. In April 1990, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended its Regulation 144A. This allowed large investors to begin trading these privately placed securities among themselves even though, in general, privately placed securities do not satisfy the stringent disclosure and informational requirements that the SEC imposes on approved publicly registered issues. As a result, Rule 144A has made the markets for privately placed securities more liquid than they would otherwise be. According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the value of privately placed debt securities in the United States was 214.7 billion in 2018.

Issuers of privately placed bonds tend to be less well known (e.g., medium-sized municipalities and corporations). As a result of a lack of information on these issues, and the resulting possibility of greater risk, interest rates paid to holders of privately placed bonds tend to be higher than on publicly placed bond issues. Although Rule 144A has improved the liquidity of privately placed bonds, this market is still less liquid than the public placement market. Another result of the increased attention to this market by investment banks is that the interest premiums paid by borrowers of privately placed issues over public issues have decreased.

Although the SEC defines large investors as those with assets of \$1 million or more or income above \$200,000 per year in the last two years (300,000 for families)—which excludes all but the very wealthiest household savers—it is reasonable to ask how long this size restriction will remain. As they become more sophisticated and the costs of information acquisition fall, savers will increasingly demand access to the private placement market. In such a world, savers would have a choice not only between the secondary securities from financial institutions and the primary securities publicly offered by municipalities and corporations but also between publicly offered (registered) securities and privately offered (unregistered) securities.

Secondary Market Trading. The secondary market for municipal bonds is thin (i.e., trades are relatively infrequent). Thin trading is mainly a result of a lack of information on bond issuers, as well as special features (such as covenants) that are built into those bonds' contracts. Information on municipal bond issuers (particularly of smaller government units) is generally more costly to obtain and evaluate, although this is in part offset by bond rating agencies (see below). In a similar fashion, bond rating agencies generate information about corporate and sovereign (country) borrowers as well.

## Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are long-term bonds issued by corporations ( \$9.2 trillion outstanding in 2018). The minimum denomination on publicly traded corporate bonds (which, in contrast to privately placed corporate bonds, require SEC registration) is\$ 1,000, and coupon-paying corporate bonds generally pay interest semiannually.

The bond indenture is the legal contract that specifies the rights and obligations of the bond issuer (corporate or government) and the bond holders. The bond indenture contains a number of covenants associated with a bond issue. These bond covenants describe rules and restrictions placed on the bond issuer and bond holders. As described below, these covenants include rights for the bond issuer, such as the ability to call the bond issue, and restrictions, such as limits on the ability of the issuer to increase dividends paid to equity holders. By legally documenting the rights and obligations of all parties involved in a bond issue, the bond indenture helps lower the risk (and therefore the interest cost) of the bond

issue. All matters pertaining to the bond issuer's performance regarding any debt covenants as well as bond repayments are overseen by a trustee (frequently a bank trust department) who is appointed as the bond holders' representative or "monitor." The signature of a trustee on the bond is a guarantee of the bond's authenticity. The trustee also acts as the transfer agent for the bonds when ownership changes as a result of secondary market sales and when interest payments are made from the bond issuer to the bond holder. The trustee also informs the bond holders if the firm is no longer meeting the terms of the indenture. In this case, the trustee initiates any legal action on behalf of the bond holders against the issuing firm. In the event of a subsequent reorganization or liquidation of the bond issuer, the trustee continues to act on behalf of the bond holders to protect their principal.

Bond Characteristics. Corporate bonds have many different characteristics that differentiate one issue from another. We list and briefly define these characteristics in Table 6-8, and we describe them in detail below. Many of these characteristics apply to other bond types as well.

Bearer versus Registered Bonds. Corporate bonds can be bearer bonds or registered bonds. With bearer bonds, coupons are attached to the bond and the holder (bearer) at the time of the coupon payment gets the relevant coupon paid on presentation to the issuer (i.e., gets the bond coupon "clipped"). With a registered bond, the bond holder's (or owner's) identification information is kept in an electronic record by the issuer and the coupon payments are mailed or wire-transferred to the bank account of the registered owner. Because of the lack of security with bearer bonds, they have largely been replaced by registered bonds in the United States.

Term versus Serial Bonds. Most corporate bonds are term bonds, meaning that the entire issue matures on a single date. Some corporate bonds (and most municipal bonds), on the other hand, are serial bonds, meaning that the issue contains many maturity dates, with a portion of the issue being paid off on each date. For economic reasons, many issuers like to

# TABLE 6-8 Bond Characteristics

Bearer bonds—bonds on which coupons are attached. The bond holder presents the coupons to the issuer for payments of interest when they come due.

Registered bonds—with a registered bond, the owner's identification information is recorded by the issuer and the coupon payments are mailed to the registered owner.

Term bonds—bonds in which the entire issue matures on a single date.

Serial bonds—bonds that mature on a series of dates, with a portion of the issue paid off on each.

Mortgage bonds—bonds that are issued to finance specific projects that are pledged as collateral for the bond issue.

Equipment trust certificates—bonds collateralized with tangible non-real estate property (e.g., railcars and airplanes).

Debentures—bonds backed solely by the general credit of the issuing firm and unsecured by specific assets or collateral.

Subordinated debentures—unsecured debentures that are junior in their rights to mortgage bonds and regular debentures.

Convertible bonds—bonds that may be exchanged for another security of the issuing firm at the discretion of the bond holder.

Stock warrants—bonds that give the bond holder an opportunity to purchase common stock at a specified price up to a specified date.

Callable bonds—bonds that allow the issuer to force the bond holder to sell the bond back to the issuer at a price above the par value (at the call price).

Sinking fund provisions—bonds that include a requirement that the issuer retire a certain amount of the bond issue each year.

# mortgage bonds

# convertible bonds

Bonds that may be exchanged for another security of the issuing firm at the discretion of the bond holder.

avoid a "crisis at maturity." Rather than having to pay off one very large principal sum at a given time in the future (as with a term issue), many issuers like to stretch out the period over which principal payments are made—especially if the corporation's earnings are quite volatile.

Mortgage Bonds. Corporations issue mortgage bonds to finance specific projects that are pledged as collateral for the bond issue. Thus, mortgage bond issues are secured debt issues.[9] Bond holders may legally take title to the collateral to obtain payment on the bonds if the issuer of a mortgage bond defaults. Because mortgage bonds are backed with a claim to specific assets of the corporate issuer, they are less risky investments than unsecured bonds. As a result, mortgage bonds have lower yields to bond holders than unsecured bonds. Equipment trust certificates are bonds collateralized with tangible (movable) non-real estate property such as railcars and airplanes.

Debentures and Subordinated Debentures. Bonds backed solely by the general creditworthiness of the issuing firm, unsecured by specific assets or collateral, are called debentures. Debenture holders generally receive their promised payments only after the secured debt holders, such as mortgage bond holders, have been paid. Subordinated debentures are also unsecured, and they are junior in their rights to mortgage bonds and regular debentures. In the event of a default, subordinated debenture holders receive a cash distribution only after all nonsubordinated debt has been repaid in full. As a result, subordinated bonds are the riskiest type of bond and generally have higher yields than nonsubordinated bonds. In many cases, these bonds are termed high-yield or junk bonds because of their below investment grade credit ratings (see the following).

Convertible Bonds. Convertible bonds are bonds that may be exchanged for another security of the issuing firm (e.g., common stock) at the discretion of the bond holder.

If the market value of the securities the bond holder receives with conversion exceeds the market value of the bond, the bond holder can return the bonds to the issuer in exchange for the new securities and make a profit. As a result, conversion is an attractive option or feature to bond holders. Thus, convertible bonds are hybrid securities involving elements of both debt and equity. They give the bond holder an investment opportunity (an option) that is not available with nonconvertible bonds. As a result, the yield on a convertible bond is usually lower (generally, 2 to 5 percentage points) than that on a nonconvertible bond:

$$ r_{c v b} = r_{n c v b} - o p_{c v b}
$$ where


$$ r_{c v b} = \text{Yi el do na co nv er ti bl eb on d}
$$

$$ r_{n c v b} = \text{Yi el da no nc on ve rt ib le bo nd}
$$

$$ o p_{c v b} = \text{Va lu eo ft he co nv en si on op ti on to th eb on dh ol de r}
$$

# EXAMPLE 6-9 Analysis of a Convertible Bond

In January 2020, Tesla Motors had a convertible bond issue outstanding. Each bond, with a face value of  \$1,000, could be converted into common shares at a rate of 3.2276 shares of stock per\$ 1,000 face value bond (the conversion rate), or \$309.83 per share. On January 17, 2020, Tesla's common stock was trading (on the NASDAQ) at \$510.50 per share. While this might look like conversion would not be very profitable, Tesla's convertible bonds were trading at 179.28 percent of the face value of the bond, or 1,792.80.

To determine whether or not it is profitable to convert the bonds into common stock in Tesla, the conversion value of each bond can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Co nv er si on} = \frac{\text{Cu rr en tm ar ke tp ri ce of co mm on}}{\text{st oc kr ec ei ve do nc on ve rs io n}} \times \text{Co nv er si on ra te}
$$

If a bond holder were to convert Tesla bonds into stock, each bond (worth  \$1,792.80) could be exchanged for 3.2276 shares of stock worth\$ 510.50 per share. The conversion value of the bond is:

$$
\$ 510.50 \times 3.2276 = \$ 1,647.69
$$

Thus, a convertible bond holder would have no incentive to convert his or her Tesla convertible bonds into its common stock equivalent.

Figure 6-8 illustrates the value of a convertible bond as a function of the issuing firm's asset value. The horizontal axis plots the firm's value, which establishes an upper bound for the value of the convertible bond (since it cannot trade for more than the value of the firm's assets). Thus, the value of the issuing firm line that bisects the figure at a  $45^{\circ}$  angle also represents the issuing firm's value and sets an upper bound for the value of the convertible bond. In addition, the figure plots the values of the firm's convertible and nonconvertible bonds. At low firm values, the values of both bonds drop off as bankruptcy becomes more likely. Note that the nonconvertible bond's value does not increase at higher firm asset values since bond holders receive only their promised payments and no more. However, the convertible bond values rise directly with the firm's asset value. Specifically, at low firm asset values the convertible bond value acts more like a nonconvertible bond, trading at only a slight premium over the nonconvertible bond. When the issuing firm's value is high, however, the convertible will act more like a stock, selling for only a slight premium over the conversion value. In the middle range, the convertible bond will trade as a hybrid security, acting partly like a bond and partly like a stock.

Figure 6-8 Value of a Convertible Bond

Most convertible bond issues are set up so that it is not initially profitable to convert to stock. Usually the stock price must increase 15 to 20 percent before it becomes profitable to convert the bond to the new security.

# stock warrants

Bonds issued with stock warrants attached giving the bond holder an opportunity to purchase common stock at a specified price up to a specified date.

# call provision

A provision on a bond issue that allows the issuer to force the bond holder to sell the bond back to the issuer at a price above the par value (or at the call price).

# call premium

The difference between the call price and the face value on the bond.

Stock Warrants. Bonds can also be issued with stock warrants attached. Similar to convertible bonds, bonds issued with stock warrants attached give the bond holder an opportunity to detach the warrants to purchase common stock at a prespecified price up to a prespecified date. In this case, however, if the bond holder decides to purchase the stock (by returning or exercising the warrant), the bond holder does not have to return the underlying bond to the issuer (as with a convertible bond). Instead, he or she keeps the bond and pays for additional stock at a price specified in the warrant. Bond holders will exercise their warrants if the market value of the stock is greater than the price at which the stock can be purchased through the warrant. Further, the bond holder may sell the warrant rather then exercise it, while maintaining ownership of the underlying bond. Risky firms commonly attach stock warrants to their bonds to increase the bonds' marketability. Rather than paying extremely high interest rates or accepting very restrictive bond covenants, the firm attaches stock warrants to the bonds in order to get investors to buy them.

Callable Bonds. Many corporate bond issues include a call provision, which allows the issuer to require the bond holder to sell the bond back to the issuer at a given (call) price—usually set above the par value of the bond. The difference between the call price and the face value on the bond is the call premium. Many callable bond issues have a deferred call provision in which the right to call the bond is deferred for a period of time after the bond is issued (generally 10 years). Bonds are usually called in when interest rates drop (and bond prices rise) so that the issuer can gain by calling in the old bonds (with higher coupon rates) and issuing new bonds (with lower coupon rates). Thus, the call feature facilitates refinancing of the debt if/when interest rates fall during the life of the bond.

For example, in 2016, ACCO Brands Corp. had a  \$500,000 payable debt issue outstanding. The face value of each bond was\$ 1,000. The issue, with a maturity date of April 30, 2020, was callable as a whole or in part not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days following April 30 of each year at a redemption price of 103.38 percent beginning April 30, 2017, and thereafter at prices declining annually to 100 percent on or after April 30, 2019. Note that as the bond approaches maturity, the call premium declines. The closer the bond is to maturity, the smaller the premium required for forcing bond holders to give up the bonds early.

A call provision is an unattractive feature to bond holders, since the bond holder may be forced to return the bond to the issuer before he or she is ready to end the investment and the investor can only reinvest the funds at a lower interest rate. As a result, callable bonds have higher yields (generally between 0.05 and 0.25 percent) than comparable noncallable bonds:

$$ r_{n c b} = r_{c b} - o p_{c b}
$$ where


$r_{ncb} =$  Yield on a noncallable bond

$r_{cb} =$  Yield on a callable bond

$op_{cb} =$  Value of the issuer's option to call the debt early

# sinking fund provision

A requirement that the issuer retire a certain amount of the bond issue each year.

Sinking Fund Provisions. Many bonds have a sinking fund provision, which is a requirement that the issuer retire a certain amount of the bond issue early over a number of years, especially as the bond approaches maturity. The bond issuer provides the funds to the trustee by making frequent payments to a sinking fund. This sinking fund accumulates in value and is eventually used to retire the entire bond issue at maturity or to periodically retire a specified dollar amount of bonds either by purchasing them in the open market or by randomly calling bonds to be retired. In this case, the selected bonds are called and redeemed. Once the bonds are called they cease to earn interest. The bond holders must surrender their bonds to receive their principal.[10] For example, in 2016 State of Illinois had a sinking fund debenture issue outstanding that required that the state put an amount each year from 2032 through 2038 (as listed in Table 6-9) into a sinking fund, so that all of the 348 billion principal on the bonds would be accumulated before maturity.

Since it reduces the probability of default at the maturity date, a sinking fund provision is an attractive feature to bond holders. Thus, bonds with a sinking fund provision are less risky to the bond holder and generally have lower yields than comparable bonds without a sinking fund provision. Some sinking fund bonds, however, are redeemed at par or market value, whichever is less, which creates price risk for the holder (if a bond is redeemed at par when its straight value is above par).

The Trading Process for Corporate Bonds Primary sales of corporate bond issues occur through either a public sale (issue) or a private placement in a manner identical to that discussed for municipal bonds (see above). As of 2018, there were approximately 30,000 outstanding corporate bonds with around \$31.2 billion in daily trading volume. New issuance volume was \$1.4 trillion.

There are two secondary markets that trade corporate bonds: the exchange market (e.g., NYSE Bonds) and the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The major exchange for corporate bonds is the New York Stock Exchange Bonds Trading Platform. Most of the trading on the NYSE's bond market is completed through its NYSE Arca all-electronic trading system, which provides investors with the ability to readily obtain transparent pricing and

trading information. The system includes the bonds of all NYSE-listed companies and their subsidiaries without the companies having to list each bond issued. However, only a small amount of bond trading volume occurs on organized exchanges. The average daily dollar value of bond trading totaled  \$31.2 billion in 2018 in a market with\$ 9.2 trillion of bonds outstanding.

Most bonds are traded OTC among major bond dealers such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS Paine Webber. Some mutual funds, such as Fidelity and Vanguard, make both primary and secondary markets in bonds and facilitate the participation of individual investors in these markets. Virtually all large trades are carried out on the OTC market, even for bonds listed on an exchange, such as the NYSE bond market. As a result, prices reported on the exchanges (like those in Table 6-7) are generally considered to be inexact estimates of prices associated with large transactions. Thus, in contrast to Treasury securities, secondary market trading of corporate bonds can involve a significant degree of liquidity risk.

## Bond Ratings and Interest Rate Spreads

As mentioned earlier, the inability of investors to get information pertaining to the risk, especially default risk, on bonds, at a reasonable cost, can result in thinly traded markets. In Chapter 3, we examined the impact of interest rate risk (i.e., interest rate changes) on bond prices. Specifically, we demonstrated that bonds with longer maturities (durations) and low coupon rates experience larger price changes for a given change in interest rates than bonds with short maturities and high coupon rates (i.e., bonds with longer maturities and lower coupon rates are subject to greater interest rate risk). Just as important, bond investors also need to measure the degree of default risk on a bond.

Large bond investors, traders, and managers often evaluate default risk by conducting their own analysis of the issuer, including an assessment of the bond issuer's financial ratios (see Chapter 21) and security prices. Small investors are not generally capable of generating the same extensive information and thus frequently rely on bond ratings provided by the bond rating agencies. The three major bond rating agencies are Moody's, Standard & Poor's (S&P), and Fitch Ratings. Each of these companies rank bonds based on the perceived probability of issuer default and assign a rating based on a letter grade. Table 6-10 summarizes these rating systems and provides a brief definition of each. The highest credit quality (lowest default risk) that rating agencies assign is a triple-A (Aaa for Moody's and AAA for S&P and Fitch). Bonds with a triple-A rating have the lowest interest spread over similar maturity Treasury securities (see below). As the assessed default risk increases, Moody's, S&P, and Fitch lower the credit rating assigned on a bond issue, and the interest spread over similar maturity Treasuries paid to bond holders generally increases.[11]

As a practical matter, a bond needs to be rated if it is to be used as an investment vehicle by certain institutional investors. Bonds rated Baa or better by Moody's and BBB or better by S&P and Fitch are considered to be investment grade bonds. Financial institutions (e.g., banks, insurance companies) are generally prohibited by state and federal law from purchasing anything but investment grade bond securities.[12] Bonds rated below Baa by Moody's and BBB by S&P and Fitch are considered to be speculative grade bonds and are often termed junk bonds, or high-yield bonds. A bond downgraded from investment grade status (e.g., BBB) to junk bond status (e.g., B) is called a "fallen angel." The issuance of speculative bonds was rare prior to the economic downturn of the late 1970s. Given the risk involved with speculative bonds and the ready availability of investment grade bonds, investment banks had a difficult time marketing the more speculative bonds to primary bond market investors. The market grew significantly in the late 1990s, with smaller and medium-sized firms, unqualified to issue investment grade debt securities, issuing long-term debt in this market.

However, as the credit quality of corporations deteriorated during the financial crisis, the issuance of high-yield debt increased, peaking at \$362.2 billion in 2012. By 2018, high-yield debt issuance fell back to \$169.4 billion.

Rating agencies consider several factors in determining and assigning credit ratings on bond issues. For example, a financial analysis is conducted of the issuer's operations and its needs, its position in the industry, and its overall financial strength and ability to pay the required interest and principal on the bonds. Rating agencies analyze the issuer's liquidity, profitability, debt capacity, and more recently its corporate governance structure (following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002—see Chapter 8). Then for each particular issue, rating agencies evaluate the nature and provisions of the debt issue (e.g., the covenants and callability of the bond) and the protection afforded by, and relative position of, the debt issue in the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

In recent years rating agencies have been criticized as slow to react. One example of this was the failure to downgrade Enron (one of the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history) in the months leading up to its failure in 2001. More recent is the failure of rating agencies to downgrade ratings on mortgage-backed securities. Throughout the financial crisis, major credit rating firms were criticized for putting top ratings on these securities, which ultimately collapsed in value and led to billions of dollars of losses for investors who had relied on the ratings to signal which securities were safe to buy. Further, because rating agencies, in particular Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, are for-profit companies, their incentives were criticized for being misaligned. Specifically, conflicts of interest arose because the rating agencies are paid by the investment companies issuing the securities—an arrangement that came under fire as a disincentive for the agencies to be vigilant on behalf of investors. As a result of these criticisms, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in July 2010, included a provision that allows investors to sue credit rating firms for "knowing or reckless" failure, establishes an oversight office within the SEC with the ability to fine credit raters, and empowers the SEC to deregister firms that give too many incorrect ratings over time. Almost three years later, in February 2013, the U.S. Justice Department sued S&P, alleging the firm ignored its own standards to rate mortgage bonds that imploded in the financial crisis, cost investors billions, and nearly brought down the world's financial systems. A week later 13 state attorneys general also filed lawsuits against S&P, alleging the firm presented its ratings as based on objective and independent analysis, when they were actually inflated to cater to banking clients.


In Chapter 2, we examined other factors (in addition to default risk) that affect interest rates on individual bonds. These factors included liquidity risk, special provisions written into the bond contract (e.g., callability, sinking fund provisions), and the term to maturity of the bond. In addition to these factors that are unique to each bond, interest rates on all bonds are affected by inflation and the real risk-free rate (typically measured using Treasury rates). The interest rate spread on a bond contains information on how these other factors, along with default risk, affect the rate of return on a bond. The interest rate spread (or just spread) is the difference between the rate of return on a bond and the return on a similar maturity Treasury security. The spread measures the return premium a bond earns to compensate not just for default risk, but also for liquidity risk and any special provisions on the bond. Thus, a spread is considered by many investors to be a more comprehensive and more current source of information regarding the overall risk of a bond than Moody's, S&P, and Fitch credit ratings. Given the added factors incorporated into bond spreads, it is possible for spreads and credit ratings to sometimes appear to conflict with each other. Consider a bond issued by a company that is financially sound but trades very infrequently. The credit rating (which captures mainly default risk) may be high, which would imply that the interest rate and thus the spread on the bond would be low. However, the spread also incorporates liquidity risk, which is high in this case and results in a higher interest rate and a higher spread on the bond.

Figure 6-9 shows the rates on 10-year Treasury securities versus Aaa-rated and Baa-rated bonds from 1980 through 2019. The average spread over this period on Aaa-rated bonds and Baa-rated bonds was 1.24 percent and 2.32 percent, respectively. Note the sharp increase in the spread in late 2008 and early 2009, rising to as much as 2.63 percent on Aaa-rated bonds and 6.01 percent on Baa-rated bonds in November 2008. During the financial crisis, investors worldwide, searching for a safe haven for their funds, invested huge amounts of funds in U.S. Treasury securities. The amount of money invested in these securities was so large that the yields dropped significantly. At the same time, default and liquidity risk on corporate bonds increased as the U.S. economy experienced a strong recession. The result was an increase in the interest rate spreads (risk premiums) on corporate bonds.

8. Who the major purchasers of bond market securities are?

Bond markets bring together suppliers and demanders of long-term funds. We have just seen that the major issuers of debt market securities are federal, state, and local governments and corporations. The major purchasers of capital market securities are households, businesses, government units, and foreign investors. In 2007, China held  \$388 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. As a result, China is deeply dependent on the success of the U.S. economy. However, threatened with sanctions on its imports to the United States in summer 2007, China stated that it would liquidate its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and send the U.S. economy into a downward spiral, a so-called nuclear option. Further, such a large holding of U.S. Treasury securities by one country, threatening to ruin the U.S. economy, threatened the position of the dollar as a reserve currency. Just the threat of such action by China resulted in Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries reducing their dollar holdings. Despite these threats, China had increased its holdings of Treasury securities to\$ 1.32 trillion by 2013. In mid-2015 Japan reclaimed its position as the largest investor in U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. debt offered the highest yields relative to other countries, which provided Japan with the incentive to increase its holdings. Holdings of U.S. Treasuries remained at high levels until late 2015 when China's central bank (as well as the Bank of Japan) started to sell its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities to prop up its own currencies. During the financial crisis, these countries bought hundreds of billions of dollars of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury as a chance to build up their foreign reserves. After years of building up savings, the U.S. Treasury security sales were a sign of how aggressively central banks were willing to act to keep their economy afloat amid global weakness.

Figure 6-10 shows the percentage of each type of bond security held by the major groups. Notice that financial firms, called Business Financial (e.g., banks, insurance companies, mutual funds), are the major suppliers of funds for two of the three types of

Financial firms hold 36.65 percent of all Treasury securities, 51.77 percent of municipal bonds, and 61.53 percent of the corporate bonds outstanding. In addition to their direct investment reported in Figure 6-10, households often deposit excess funds in financial firms (such as mutual bond funds and pension funds) that use these funds to purchase bond market securities. Thus, much of the business and financial holdings of bond securities shown in Figure 6-10 reflects indirect investments of households in the bond market.

9. What events can cause yield spreads on bond securities to change?

Figure 6-11 shows the yield to maturity on various types of bonds (e.g., 10-year Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, and high-grade corporate bonds) from 1980 through 2019. While the general trends in yields were quite similar over this period (i.e., yield changes are highly correlated), yield spreads among bonds can vary as default risk, tax status, and marketability change. For example, yield spread differences can change when characteristics of a particular type of bond are perceived to be more or less favorable to the bond holder (e.g., relative changes in yield spreads can result when the default risk increases for a firm that has one bond issue with a sinking fund provision and another issue without a sinking fund provision). Economic conditions can also cause bond yield spreads to vary over time. This is particularly true during periods of slow economic growth (e.g., 1982, 1989-1991, and 2008-2019, as discussed previously), as investors require higher default risk premiums. The St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank offers free online access to its database (called FRED) of U.S. economic and financial data, including daily U.S. interest rates, monetary business indicators, exchange rates, balance of payments, and regional economic data. Also, Bloomberg has free online access to current bond yields of all types and characteristics discussed in this chapter.

## International Aspects of Bond Markets

LG 6-4

International bond markets are those markets that trade bonds that are underwritten by an international syndicate, offer bonds to investors in different countries, issue bonds outside the jurisdiction of any single country, and offer bonds in unregistered form. For investors, adding international bonds to a fixed-income portfolio can be a way to diversify risk in a domestically based portfolio. International sovereign bonds have historically exhibited low correlation in returns with U.S. and international stocks. This is particularly true during times of extreme stock market stress. However, during times of foreign turmoil, such as the 2009-2013 European sovereign debt crisis, the costs of international debt can be too high (i.e., the returns can be too low) and the diversification benefits not worthwhile. Further, changes in the dollar/foreign currency exchange rate must be considered when investing in international bonds. If the dollar goes up (down) in value during the period of investment, international bonds will lose (gain) value (see Chapter 9).

For bond issuers, the existence of sophisticated international bond markets increases the available financing options and range of assets. Further, competition from international markets motivates domestic markets to implement improvements in market infrastructure, investor protection, and tax distortions that hinder domestic market development. However, international bond market placements can also increase risk for an issuer. For example, they may cause sudden shifts in capital flows and result in a concentration of liquidity away from the domestic market. If liquidity tends to concentrate in offshore bond markets, there are likely to be significant costs for bond issuers connected to reduced liquidity onshore, less scope for development of a lower-grade market in domestic currency, more limited availability of collateral for domestic markets, and restricted access for domestic investors.

Table 6-12 lists the values of international debt outstanding by currency and type from 1995 through 2018. At the end of 2018, international debt securities outstanding totaled  \$24.22 trillion, compared to\$ 3.07 trillion in 1996. Straight fixed-rate securities dominate the market, mainly because of the strong demand for dollar and some euro currency assets and historically low interest rates in developed countries. Floating-rate notes were second in size, partly as a result of interest rate uncertainty in the late 1990s and 2000s.

Note that majority of international debt instruments were denominated in local currency. For example, in December 2004, 49.3 percent of all international debt securities were denominated in local currency. Outside of local currency denominated debt, the U.S. dollar denominated debt surpasses the euro denominated debt. The percent of international debt securities denominated in U.S. dollars was 32.4 percent in 1996, 19.1 percent in 2004, 23.0 percent in 2010, and 37.6 percent in 2018. Between debt securities issued by financial institutions, non-financial corporations and general government, general government debt is much more likely to be denominated in U.S. dollar. For example, in December 2018, 60.4 percent of general government debt securities were denominated in U.S. dollar. In terms of interest rate type, fixed rate debt securities are two to three times more common than floating rate securities. The percent of fixed rate international debt securities ranges from 61.9 percent to 68.7 percent over the time period 1996-2018.

Figure 6-12 illustrates the distribution of international bonds by type of issuer (e.g., financial institutions, governments) as of 2018. Financial institutions issue the vast majority of floating-rate bonds (90.2 percent) and most of the straight fixed-rate bonds (69.7 percent). Financial institutions had been hampered in 1998 by concerns over their exposures to lower-rated countries. However, the stabilization of market conditions in 1999 and the 2000s made it easier for U.S. and European financial institutions to issue new debt securities.

International bonds can also be classified into three main groups: Eurobonds, foreign bonds, and sovereign bonds.

Eurobonds. Eurobonds are long-term bonds issued and sold outside the country of the currency in which they are denominated (e.g., dollar-denominated bonds issued in Europe or Asia). Perhaps confusingly, the term Euro simply implies the bond is issued outside the country in whose currency the bond is denominated. Thus, "Euro" bonds are issued in countries outside of Europe and in currencies other than the euro. Indeed, the majority of issues are still in U.S. dollars and can be issued in virtually any region of the world. Eurobonds were first sold in 1963 as a way to avoid taxes and regulation. U.S. corporations were limited by regulations on the amount of funds they could borrow domestically (in the United States) to finance overseas operations, while foreign issues in the United States were subject to a special 30 percent tax on their coupon interest. In 1963, these corporations created the Eurobond, by which bonds were denominated in various currencies and were not directly subject to U.S. regulation. Even when these regulations were abandoned, access to a new and less-regulated market by investors and corporations created sufficient demand and supply for the market to continue to grow.

Eurobonds are generally issued in denominations of  \$5,000 and\$ 10,000. They pay interest annually using a 360-day year (floating-rate Eurobonds generally pay interest every six months on the basis of a spread over some stated rate, usually the LIBOR rate). Eurobonds are generally bearer bonds and are traded in the over-the-counter markets, mainly in London and Luxembourg. Historically, they have been of interest to smaller investors who want to shield the ownership of securities from the tax authorities. The classic investor is the "Belgian dentist" who would cross the border to Luxembourg on the coupon date to collect his coupons without the knowledge of the Belgian tax authority. However, today small investors—of the Belgian dentist type—are overshadowed in importance by large investors such as mutual and pension funds. Ratings services such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's generally rate Eurobonds. Equity-related Eurobonds are convertible bonds (bonds convertible into equity) or bonds with equity warrants attached.

Eurobonds are placed in primary markets by investment banks. Often, a syndicate of investment banks works together to place the Eurobonds. Most Eurobonds are issued via firm commitment offerings, although the spreads in this market are much larger than for domestic bonds because of the need to distribute the bonds across a wide investor base often covering many countries. Thus, the underwriters bear the risk associated with the initial sale of the bonds. The Eurobond issuer chooses the currency in which the bond issue will be denominated. The promised payments of interest and principal must then be paid in this currency. Thus, the choice of currency, and particularly the level and volatility in the interest rates of the country of the currency, affect the overall cost of the Eurobond to the bond issuer and the rate of return to the bond holder.

The full introduction of the euro in 2002 has certainly changed the structure of the Eurobond market. Most obvious is that Eurobonds denominated in the individual European currencies no longer exist but rather are denominated in a single currency, the euro. Further, liquidity created by the consolidation of European currencies allows for the demand and size of euro-denominated Eurobond issues to increase. Such growth was exhibited early in the life of the euro (or the European currency unit [ECU] prior to 2002) as the volume of new Euro debt issues in the first and second quarter of 1999 rose 32 percent and 43 percent, respectively, from the same periods in 1998. In January 1999, a record  \$415 billion in long-term Eurobonds were issued. In 2000 and 2001, a total of\$ 989.1 billion long-term Eurobonds were issued, and in 2007 over \$1.2 trillion of long-term Eurobonds were issued. The worldwide financial crisis and then the European debt crisis severely impacted the growth of the Eurobond markets. New issuances of long-term Eurobonds fell to  \$947.0 billion in 2008,\$ 322.0 billion in 2010, \$76.0 billion in 2012, and 87.2 billion in 2015.

Foreign Bonds. Foreign bonds are long-term bonds issued by firms and governments outside of the issuer's home country and are usually denominated in the currency of the country in which they are issued rather than in their own domestic currency—for

# sovereign bonds

Government-issued, foreign currency-denominated debt.

example, a Japanese company issuing a dollar-denominated public bond rather than a yen-denominated bond in the United States. Foreign bonds were issued long before Eurobonds and, as a result, are frequently called traditional international bonds. Countries sometimes name their foreign bonds to denote the country of origin. For example, foreign bonds issued in the United States are called Yankee bonds, foreign bonds issued in Japan are called Samurai bonds, and foreign bonds issued in the United Kingdom are called Bulldog bonds.

There is also reverse Yankee bonds, which are bonds issued in foreign currencies by U.S. companies outside the U.S. Reverse Yankee bonds are largely a 21st-century phenomenon. Euro-denominated reverse Yankee issuance was almost zero in the year 2000, but by 2006 it had risen to 40 billion euros. It dropped back during the financial crisis, but then rose sharply from 2012 onwards and reached 330 billion euros by 2017. Analysts think that this enormous increase in reverse Yankee issuance is largely driven by divergent European and U.S. monetary policy. The European Central Bank (ECB) has maintained very low interest rates while the U.S. has been raising rates. This has encouraged U.S. companies to issue debt denominated in euros. In addition, the euro's weak exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar makes European companies attractive takeover targets for US firms. Funding at least part of such acquisitions in euros has been the preferred route for many companies.

Sovereign Bonds. Sovereign bonds are government-issued debt. Sovereign bonds have historically been issued in foreign currencies, in either U.S. dollars or euros. Lesser developed country (LDC) sovereign debt tends to have a lower credit rating than other sovereign debt because of the increased economic and political risks. Where most developed countries are either AAA- or AA-rated, most LDC issuance is rated below investment grade, although a few countries that have seen significant improvements have been upgraded to BBB or A ratings, and a handful of lower income countries have reached ratings levels equivalent to more developed countries. Accordingly, sovereign bonds require higher interest spreads. For example, sovereign bonds are uncollateralized and their price or value reflects the credit risk rating of the country issuing the bonds. The 2.8 billion June 1997 issue by Brazil of 30-year dollar-denominated bonds (rated BB grade by Standard & Poor's) was sold at a yield spread of nearly 4 percent over U.S. Treasuries at the time of issue. In July 2001, Argentinian sovereign bonds were trading at spreads of over 15 percent above U.S. Treasury rates, with the JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index showing a spread of nearly 10 percent over U.S. Treasuries. This reflected the serious economic problems in Argentina and the contagious effects these were having on other sovereign bond markets. More recently, in September 2008, fears of the global economic crisis and falling commodity prices hit emerging markets particularly hard: the sovereign debt spread jumped from 165 to over 587 basis points in Mexico; from 200 to over 586 basis points in Brazil; from 69 to over 322 basis points in Chile; from over 29 to more than 600 basis points in Colombia; and from 942 and 873 basis points to over 4,019 and 2,325 basis points in Argentina and Venezuela, respectively. By the week of October 24, 2008, spreads had tripled since early August 2008.

Problems with sovereign bonds continued into 2009 and 2010. For example, in November 2009, Dubai World, the finance arm of Dubai, asked creditors for a six-month delay on interest payments due on  \$60 billion of the country's debt. In the mid- and late 2000s, Dubai became a center of investment and development, much of it funded by burgeoning oil wealth from neighboring countries. But during the financial crisis, the Middle East nation was hard hit by a falling real estate market. Further, throughout the spring of 2010 Greece struggled with a severe debt crisis. Early on, some of the healthier European countries tried to step in and assist the debt-ridden country. Specifically, in March 2010, a plan led by Germany and France to bail out Greece with as much as\$ 41 billion in aid began to take shape. However, in late April, Greek bond prices dropped dramatically as traders began betting a debt default was inevitable, even if the country received a massive bailout. The selloff was the result of still more bad news for Greece, which showed that the

2009 budget deficit was worse than had been previously reported. As a result, politicians in Germany began to voice opposition to a Greek bailout. Further, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Greece's debt rating and warned that additional cuts could be on the way.

The problems in the Greek bond market then spread to other European nations with fiscal problems, such as Portugal, Spain, and Italy. As a result, in May 2010, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU) agreed to extend Greece an unprecedented \$147 billion rescue package in return for huge budget cuts. As crisis deepened, the Greek parliament approved a second EU-IMF bailout worth \$172 billion in February 2012. While Greece had not yet missed a bond payment, March 2012 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) declared that Greece had undergone a "restructuring credit event" which triggered insurance policy payments. The restructuring event was a forced swap of old debt held by some of its private bond holders for new debt. The swap forced a 74 percent haircut on those creditors that held out, triggering the effective default.

At one point, Greece seemed unable to form a government, and the leader of one party rejected the country's bailout commitments. It seemed increasingly conceivable that Greece might have to leave the Euro zone. Yet, the leaders of EU countries, particularly Germany and France, continued to work to keep Greek reform on track and the EU together. Further, the European Central Bank (ECB) stated that it would do whatever it took to protect the euro; the ECB prepared to move forcefully into bond markets in tandem with Europe's rescue funds and concentrated on buying shorter-term debt. While the situation in Greece was getting calmer, the crisis in the EU was not over as Spain and Italy required bailouts as well. Some feared that keeping the European Union together and the euro intact might actually draw sound countries into a crisis as they bailed out unhealthy countries to prevent them from leaving the currency union. The situation in Greece and the European Union stabilized after 2012. However, a major debt payment was due from Greece to its creditors on June 30, 2015, a payment required to continue to receive rescue funds from the EU. Knowing that they could not make the payment, Greek officials met with eurozone leaders in an attempt to get a better deal. Greece, however, was unwilling to agree to more spending cuts and other concessions requested by the EU and talks broke down. Greece would be the first developed country to default on its debt and faced the real possibility that it would be forced to leave the European Union. With its financial system near collapse and a debt payment due to the ECB on July 20, 2015, Greece was forced to continue negotiations with its creditors. In August 2015, Greece and its EU creditors agreed on a third bailout worth \$94 billion, imposing further budget cuts on the country to avoid bankruptcy and exit from the eurozone. Finally, in August 2018, Greece exited the third bailout program. In total, Greece now owes the EU and IMF roughly \$330 billion, part of a public debt that has climbed to 180 percent of GDP.

Under the doctrine of sovereign-immunity, the repayment of sovereign debt cannot be forced by the creditors and it is thus subject to compulsory rescheduling, interest rate reduction, or even repudiation. The only protection available to creditors is the threat of the loss of credibility and a lowering of the country's international standing (the sovereign debt rating of the country, which may make it much more difficult to borrow in the future).

Sovereign debt markets were rocked again in June 2016 when the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU) after 43 years (dubbed Brexit). The shock from the UK's surprise vote to leave the EU swept across global markets, triggering steep drops in stock markets and the British pound, and a flight into safe assets such as U.S. bonds and gold. The pound fell more than 11 percent to its lowest point since 1985. The DJIA dropped 610.32 points, or 3.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 7 percent, its steepest drop since 2008, while Japan's Nikkei Stock Average declined 7.9 percent. Bonds also sold off sharply, pushing UK government borrowing costs sharply higher, as traders and investors grappled with the market implications of Brexit. The UK had its credit rating outlook cut to "negative" by the ratings agency Moody's.

# SUMMARY

This chapter looked at the domestic and international bond markets. We defined and discussed the three types of bonds available to long-term debt investors: Treasury notes and bonds, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds. We also reviewed the process through which bonds trade in both primary and secondary bond markets. International bond markets have grown dramatically in recent years. We documented and offered some reasons for this growth. We concluded the chapter with a description of the different types of international bonds: the traditional foreign bonds, the relatively new Eurobonds, and sovereign bonds.
