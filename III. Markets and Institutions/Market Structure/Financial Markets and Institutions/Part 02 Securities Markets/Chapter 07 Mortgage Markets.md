Describe the trends in the international securitization of mortgages.

# MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-BACKED

# SECURITIES: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Mortgages are loans to individuals or businesses to purchase a home, land, or other real property. The property purchased with the loan serves as collateral backing the loan. As of December 2018, there were 15.4 trillion of primary mortgages outstanding, held by various financial institutions such as banks and mortgage companies. Figure 7-1 lists the major categories of mortgages and the amount of each outstanding in 1995 and 2018. Home mortgages (one to four families) are the largest loan category (70.5 percent of all mortgages in 2018), followed by commercial mortgages (used to finance specific projects that are pledged as collateral for the mortgage—18.4 percent), multifamily dwellings (9.6 percent), and farms (1.6 percent).

Many mortgages, particularly residential mortgages, are subsequently securitized by the mortgage holder—they are packaged and sold as assets backing a publicly traded or privately held debt instrument. Securitization allows financial institutions' (FIs') asset portfolios to become more liquid, reduces interest rate risk and credit risk, provides FIs

with a source of fee income, and helps reduce the effects of regulatory constraints such as capital requirements, reserve requirements, and deposit insurance premiums on FI profits (see Chapter 13). Currently, approximately 65 percent of home mortgages are securitized.

We examine mortgage markets separately from bond and stock markets for several reasons. First, mortgages are backed by a specific piece of real property. If the borrower defaults on a mortgage, the financial institution can take ownership of the property. Only mortgage bonds are backed by a specific piece of property that allows the lender to take ownership in the event of a default. All other corporate bonds and stock give the holder a general claim to a borrower's assets. Second, there is no set size or denomination for primary mortgages. Rather, the size of each mortgage depends on the borrower's needs and ability to repay. Bonds generally have a denomination of  $1,000 or a multiple of$ 1,000 per bond, and shares of stock are generally issued in (par value) denominations of 1 per share. Third, primary mortgages generally involve a single investor (e.g., a bank or mortgage company). Bond and stock issues, on the other hand, are generally held by many (sometimes thousands of) investors. Finally, the typical issuers in the mortgage market (individuals) are quite different from issuers (corporations and governments) in other financial markets. Because primary mortgage borrowers are often individuals, information on these borrowers is less extensive and unaudited. Bonds and stocks issued by publicly traded corporations and governments are subject to extensive rules and regulations regarding information availability and reliability.

The mortgage markets are something of a bellwether for the bond and stock markets, as well as the overall economy. Indeed, at the very heart of the recent financial crisis were losses associated with mortgages and off-balance-sheet mortgage-backed securities, so-called toxic assets, created and held by FIs. The roots of the financial crisis go back to the early 2000s, particularly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when the U.S. economy experienced a boom ("bubble") in the housing markets. The immediate response by regulators to the terrorist attacks was to create stability in the financial markets by providing liquidity to FIs. For example, the Federal Reserve lowered the short-term interest rate that banks and other financial institutions pay in the federal funds market and even made lender of last resort funds available to nonbank FIs such as investment banks. Perhaps not surprisingly, low interest rates and the increased liquidity provided by the central banks resulted in a rapid expansion in mortgage financing. Demand for residential mortgages rose dramatically. As the demand for mortgage debt grew, especially among those who had previously been excluded from participating in the market because of their poor credit ratings, FIs began lowering their credit quality cut-off points. Moreover, to boost their earnings in the market now popularly known as the "subprime market," banks and other mortgage lenders often offered relatively low "teaser" rates on adjustable rate mortgages (i.e., exceptionally low initial interest rates which, if market rates rose in the future, were subject to substantial increases after expiration of the initial rate period two or three year later).

Historically, banks (and other depository institutions) held these loans on their balance sheets. Under this traditional originate-and-hold model, banks might have been reluctant to so aggressively pursue low credit quality borrowers for fear that the loans would default. However, in the 1990s and 2000s, asset securitization and loan syndication allowed banks to retain little or no part of the loans, and hence little or none of the default risk on the loans that they originated. As a result, the incentive for banks to monitor the mortgage borrower's default risk decreased dramatically. As long as the borrower did not default within the first few months after a loan's issuance and the loans were sold or securitized without recourse back to the bank, the issuing bank could ignore longer-term credit risk concerns. The result was a deterioration in credit quality, while at the same time there was a dramatic increase in consumer and corporate leverage.

Eventually, in 2006, housing prices started to fall. At the same time, the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates as it began to fear inflation. Since many of the subprime mortgages that originated in the 2001-2005 period had adjustable rates, the cost of meeting mortgage commitments rose to unsustainable levels for many low-income households. The confluence of falling house prices, rising interest rates, and rising mortgage costs led to a wave of mortgage defaults in the subprime market and foreclosures that only reinforced the downward trend in housing prices. The number of subprime mortgages more than 60 days behind on their payments was 17.1 percent in June 2007 and over 20 percent by August 2007. As this happened, the poor quality of the collateral and credit quality underlying subprime mortgage pools became apparent, with default rates far exceeding those apparently anticipated by the rating agencies in setting their initial subprime mortgage securitizations ratings. In 2007, the percentage of subprime mortgage-backed securities delinquent by 90 days or more was 10.09 percent, substantially higher than the 5.37 percent rate in May 2005. The financial crisis began.

In this chapter, we look at characteristics and operations of the mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets. We look at different types of mortgages and the determination of mortgage payments. (We look at the processes used by financial institutions to evaluate mortgage loan applicants in Chapter 21.) We also discuss the agencies owned or sponsored by the U.S. government that help securitize mortgage pools. We briefly describe the major forms of mortgage-backed securities and discuss the process of securitization. More complete details of the securitization process are provided in Chapter 25. We conclude the chapter with a look at international investors in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities markets, as well as trends in international securitization of mortgage assets.

# PRIMARY MORTGAGE MARKET

LG 7-2

Four basic categories of mortgages are issued by financial institutions: home, multifamily dwelling, commercial, and farm. Home mortgages ( $10.87 trillion outstanding in 2018) are used to purchase oneto four-family dwellings. Multifamily dwelling mortgages ($ 1.47 trillion outstanding) are used to finance the purchase of apartment complexes, townhouses, and condominiums. Commercial mortgages ( $2.84 trillion) are used to finance the purchase of real estate for business purposes (e.g., office buildings, shopping malls). Farm mortgages ($ 0.25 trillion outstanding) are used to finance the purchase of farms. As seen in Figure 7-1, while all four areas have experienced tremendous growth, the historically low mortgage rates in the 1990s and 2000s have particularly spurred growth in the single-family home area (214 percent growth from 1995 through 2018), commercial business mortgages (284 percent growth), and multifamily residential mortgages (426 percent growth).

# LG 7-3

# Mortgage Characteristics

As mentioned previously, mortgages are unique as capital market instruments because the characteristics (such as size, fees, and interest rate) of each mortgage held by a financial institution can differ. A mortgage contract between a financial institution and a borrower must specify all of the characteristics of the mortgage agreement. When a financial institution receives a mortgage application, it must determine whether the applicant qualifies for a loan. (We describe this process in Chapter 21.) Because most financial institutions sell or securitize their mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market (discussed below), the guidelines set by the secondary market buyer for acceptability, as well as the guidelines set by the financial institution, are used to determine whether or not a mortgage borrower is qualified. Further, the characteristics of loans to be securitized will generally be more standardized than those that are not to be securitized. When mortgages are not securitized, the financial institution can be more flexible with the acceptance/rejection guidelines it uses and mortgage characteristics will be more varied.

# lien

A public record attached to the title of the property that gives the financial institution the right to sell the property if the mortgage borrower defaults.

# down payment

A portion of the purchase price of the property a financial institution requires the mortgage borrower to pay up front.

# private mortgage insurance (PMI)

Insurance contract purchased by a mortgage borrower guaranteeing to pay the financial institution the difference between the value of the property and the balance remaining on the mortgage.

# federally insured mortgages

Mortgages originated by financial institutions, with repayment guaranteed by either the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Veterans Administration (VA).

Collateral. As mentioned in the introduction, all mortgage loans are backed by a specific piece of property that serves as collateral to the mortgage loan. As part of the mortgage agreement, the financial institution will place a lien against a property that remains in place until the loan is fully paid off. A lien is a public record attached to the title of the property that gives the financial institution the right to sell the property if the mortgage borrower defaults or falls into arrears on his or her payments. The mortgage is secured by the lien—that is, until the loan is paid off, no one can buy the property and obtain clear title to it. If someone tries to purchase the property, the financial institution can file notice of the lien at the public recorder's office to stop the transaction.

Down Payment. As part of any mortgage agreement, a financial institution requires the mortgage borrower to pay a portion of the purchase price of the property (a down payment) at the closing (the day the mortgage is issued). The balance of the purchase price is the face value of the mortgage (or the loan proceeds). A down payment decreases the probability that the borrower will default on the mortgage. A mortgage borrower who makes a large down payment invests more personal wealth into the home and, therefore, is less likely to walk away from the house should property values fall, leaving the mortgage unpaid. However, the drop in real estate values during the recent financial crisis caused many mortgage borrowers to walk away from their homes and mortgages, as well as many mortgage lenders to fail.

The size of the down payment depends on the financial situation of the borrower. Generally, a 20 percent down payment is required (i.e., the loan-to-value ratio may be no more than 80 percent). Borrowers that put up less than 20 percent are required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). (Technically, the insurance is purchased by the lender (the financial institution) but paid for by the borrower, generally as part of the monthly payment.) In the event of default, the PMI issuer (such as Radian Group Inc.) guarantees to pay the financial institution a portion (generally between 12 percent and 35 percent) of the difference between the value of the property and the balance remaining on the mortgage. As payments are made on the mortgage, or if the value of the property increases, a mortgage borrower can eventually request that the PMI requirement be removed. Every financial institution differs in its requirements for removing the PMI payment from a mortgage. However, in most cases financial institutions require a waiting period of one to two years after the loan's origination date, proof through an approved appraiser that the loan-to-value ratio is less than 80 percent, on-time payments during the waiting period, and a letter from the borrower requesting that the PMI be removed from the loan.

Insured versus Conventional Mortgages. Mortgages are classified as either federally insured or conventional. Federally insured mortgages are originated by financial institutions, but repayment is guaranteed (for a fee of 0.5 percent of the loan amount) by either the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Veterans Administration (VA). In order to qualify, FHA and VA mortgage loan applicants must meet specific requirements set by these government agencies (e.g., VA-insured loans are available only to individuals who served and were honorably discharged from military service in the United States). Further, the maximum size of the

# conventional mortgages

Mortgages issued by financial institutions that are not federally insured.

# amortized

A mortgage is amortized when the fixed principal and interest payments fully pay off the mortgage by its maturity date.

# balloon payment mortgage

Mortgage that requires a fixed monthly interest payment for a threeto five-year period. Full payment of the mortgage principal (the balloon payment) is then required at the end of the period.

mortgage is limited (the limit varies by state and is based on the cost of housing). For example, in 2019, FHA loan limits on single-family homes ranged from  $314,827 to$ 726,525, depending on location and cost of living. FHA or VA mortgages require either a very low or zero down payment. (FHA mortgages require as little as a 3 percent down payment.)

Conventional mortgages are mortgages held by financial institutions and are not federally insured (but as already discussed, they generally are required to be privately insured if the borrower's down payment is less than 20 percent of the property's value). Secondary market mortgage buyers will not generally purchase conventional mortgages that are not privately insured and that have a loan-to-value ratio of greater than 80 percent.

Mortgage Maturities. A mortgage generally has an original maturity of either 15 or 30 years. Until recently, the 30-year mortgage was the one most frequently used. However, the 15-year mortgage has grown in popularity. Mortgage borrowers are attracted to the 15-year mortgage because of the potential saving in total interest paid (see below). However, because the mortgage is paid off in half the time, monthly mortgage payments are higher on a 15-year than on a 30-year mortgage. Financial institutions find the 15-year mortgage attractive because of the lower degree of interest rate risk on a 15-year relative to a 30-year mortgage. To attract mortgage borrowers to the 15-year maturity mortgage, financial institutions generally charge a lower interest rate on a 15-year mortgage than a 30-year mortgage.

Most mortgages allow the borrower to prepay all or part of the mortgage principal early without penalty. In general, the monthly payment is set at a fixed level to repay interest and principal on the mortgage by the maturity date (i.e., the mortgage is fully amortized). We illustrate this payment pattern for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage in Figure 7-2. However, other mortgages have variable interest rates and thus payments that vary (see below).

In addition to 15and 30-year fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages, financial institutions sometimes offer balloon payment mortgages. A balloon payment mortgage requires a fixed monthly interest payment (and, sometimes, principal payments) for a threeto five-year period. Full payment of the mortgage principal (the balloon payment) is then required at the end of the period, as illustrated for a five-year balloon payment mortgage in Figure 7-2. Because they normally consist of interest only, the monthly payments prior to maturity are lower than those on an amortized loan (i.e., a loan that requires periodic repayments of principal and interest). Generally, because few borrowers save enough funds to pay off the mortgage in three to five years, the mortgage principal is refinanced at the current mortgage interest rate at the end of the balloon loan period (refinancing at maturity is not, however, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ www.bloomberg.com

guaranteed). Thus, with a balloon mortgage the financial institution essentially provides a long-term mortgage in which it can periodically revise the mortgage's characteristics.

Interest Rates. Possibly the most important characteristic identified in a mortgage contract is the interest rate on the mortgage. Mortgage borrowers often decide how much to borrow and from whom solely by looking at the quoted mortgage rates of several financial institutions. In turn, financial institutions base their quoted mortgage rates on several factors. First, they use the market rate at which they obtain funds (e.g., the fed funds rate, Treasury bond rate, or the rate on certificates of deposit). The market rate on available funds is the base rate used to determine mortgage rates. Figure 7-3 illustrates the trend in 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates and 10-year Treasury bond rates from 1980 through 2019. Note the declining trend in mortgage (and T-bond) rates over the period. During the last week of December 2019, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.74 percent, up only slightly from 3.31 percent in November 2012, an all-time record low. The average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.19 percent, compared to an all-time low of 2.56 percent in May 2013. Once the base mortgage rate is determined, the rate on a specific mortgage is then adjusted for other factors (e.g., whether the mortgage specifies a fixed or variable (adjustable) rate of interest and whether the loan specifies discount points and other fees), as discussed below.

# fixed-rate mortgage

A mortgage that locks in the borrower's interest rate and thus the required monthly payment over the life of the mortgage, regardless of how market rates change.

# adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)

A mortgage in which the interest rate is tied to some market interest rate. Thus, the required monthly payments can change over the life of the mortgage.

Fixed versus Adjustable-Rate Mortgages. Mortgage contracts specify whether a fixed or variable rate of interest will be paid by the borrower. A fixed-rate mortgage locks in the borrower's interest rate and thus required monthly payments over the life of the mortgage, regardless of how market rates change. In contrast, the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is tied to some market interest rate or interest rate index. Thus, the required monthly payments can change over the life of the mortgage. ARMs generally limit the change in the interest rate allowed each year and during the life of the mortgage (called caps). For example, an ARM might adjust the interest rate based on the average Treasury bill rate plus 1.5 percent, with caps of 1.5 percent per year and 4 percent over the life of the mortgage.

Figure 7-4 shows the percentage of ARMs relative to all mortgages closed and 30-year mortgage rates from 1987 through 2018. Notice that mortgage borrowers generally prefer fixed-rate loans to ARMs when interest rates in the economy are low. If interest rates rise, ARMs may cause borrowers to be unable to meet the promised payments on the mortgage. In contrast, most mortgage lenders prefer ARMs when interest rates are low. When interest rates eventually rise, ARM payments on their mortgage assets will rise. Since deposit rates and other liability rates too will be rising, it will be easier for financial institutions to pay the higher interest rates to their depositors when they issue ARMs. However, higher interest payments mean mortgage borrowers may have trouble making their payments. Thus, default risk increases. Such was the case during the recent financial crisis. As the general level of interest rates in the economy rose, rates on ARMs increased to the point that many borrowers had trouble meeting their payments. The result (as discussed earlier) was a record number of foreclosures. Thus, while ARMs reduce a financial institution's interest rate risk, they also increase its default risk.

Note from Figure 7-4 the behavior of the share of ARMs to fixed-rate mortgages over the period 2001 through 2003 and 2008 through 2018—when interest rates fell. Notice that borrowers' preferences for fixed-rate mortgages prevailed over this period, as a consistently low percentage of total mortgages closed were ARMs (between 2001 and 2003 the percentage of ARMs to total mortgages issued averaged only 14.8 percent). During the height of the financial crisis (late 2008–early 2009), as interest rates were dropping to historic lows, virtually no ARMs were issued.

# discount points

Interest payments made when the loan is issued (at closing). One discount point paid up front is equal to 1 percent of the principal value of the mortgage.

Discount Points. Discount points (often just called points) are fees or payments made when a mortgage loan is issued (at closing). One discount point paid up front is equal to 1 percent of the principal value of the mortgage. For example, if the borrower pays 2 points up front on a  $100,000 mortgage, he or she must pay$ 2,000 at the closing of the mortgage. While the mortgage principal is $100,000, the borrower effectively has received $98,000. In exchange for points paid up front, the financial institution reduces the interest rate used to determine the monthly payments on the mortgage. The borrower determines whether the reduced interest payments over the life of the loan outweigh the up-front fee through points. This decision depends on the period of time the borrower expects to hold the mortgage (see below).

Other Fees. In addition to interest, mortgage contracts generally require the borrower to pay an assortment of fees to cover the mortgage issuer's costs of processing the mortgage. These include such items as:

Application fee. Covers the issuer's initial costs of processing the mortgage application and obtaining a credit report.

Title search. Confirms the borrower's legal ownership of the mortgaged property and ensures there are no outstanding claims against the property.

Title insurance. Protects the lender against an error in the title search.

Appraisal fee. Covers the cost of an independent appraisal of the value of the mortgaged property.

Loan origination fee. Covers the remaining costs to the mortgage issuer for processing the mortgage application and completing the loan.

Closing agent and review fees. Cover the costs of the closing agent who actually closes the mortgage.

Other costs. Any other fees, such as VA loan guarantees, or FHA or private mortgage insurance.

Figure 7-5 presents a sample closing statement in which the various fees are reported and the payment required by the borrower at closing is determined.

Mortgage Refinancing. Mortgage refinancing occurs when a mortgage borrower takes out a new mortgage and uses the proceeds obtained to pay off the current mortgage. Mortgage refinancing involves many of the same details and steps involved in applying for a new mortgage and can involve many of the same fees and expenses. Mortgages are most often refinanced when a current mortgage has an interest rate that is higher than the current interest rate. As coupon rates on new mortgages fall, the incentive for mortgage borrowers to pay off old, high coupon rate mortgages and refinance at lower rates increases. Figure 7-6 shows the percentage of mortgage originations that involved refinancings and 30-year mortgage rates from the first quarter of 1990 through the third quarter of 2019. Notice that as mortgage rates fall, the percentage of mortgages that are refinancings increases. Over the 1990-2019 time period, correlation between refinancing share and mortgage rates is  $-0.52$ .

By refinancing the mortgage at a lower interest rate, the borrower pays less each month—even if the new mortgage is for the same amount as the current mortgage. Traditionally, the decision to refinance involves balancing the savings of a lower monthly payment against the costs (fees) of refinancing. That is, refinancing adds transaction and reconstructing costs. Origination costs or points for new mortgages, along with the cost of appraisals and credit checks, frequently arise as well. An often-cited rule of thumb is that the interest rate for a new mortgage should be 2 percentage points below the rate on the current mortgage for refinancing to make financial sense.

# Mortgage Amortization

LG 7-4

# amortization schedule

Schedule showing how the monthly mortgage payments are split between principal and interest.

The fixed monthly payment made by a mortgage borrower generally consists partly of repayment of the principal borrowed and partly of the interest on the outstanding (remaining) balance of the mortgage. In other words, these fixed payments fully amortize (pay off) the mortgage by its maturity date. During the early years of the mortgage, most of the fixed monthly payment represents interest on the outstanding principal and a small amount represents a payoff of the outstanding principal. As the mortgage approaches maturity, most of the payment represents a payoff of the outstanding principal and a small amount represents interest. An amortization schedule shows how the fixed monthly payments are split between principal and interest.

# EXAMPLE 7-1 Calculation of Monthly Mortgage Payments

You plan to purchase a house for  $150,000 using a 30-year mortgage obtained from your local bank. The mortgage rate offered to you is 8 percent with zero points. In order to forgo the purchase of private mortgage insurance, you will make a down payment of 20 percent of the purchase price ($ 30,000 = 0.20 × $150,000) at closing and borrow $120,000 through the mortgage.

The monthly payments on this mortgage are calculated using the time value of money formulas presented in Chapter 2. Specifically, the amount borrowed through the mortgage represents a present value of the principal, and the monthly payments represent a monthly annuity payment. The equation used to calculate your fixed monthly mortgage payments to pay off the 120,000 mortgage at an 8 percent annual (8\% / 12 = 0.6667\%) monthly) interest rate over 30 years (or 30 \times 12 = 360 payments) is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P V = P M T \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {t} \left(\frac {1}{1 + r}\right) ^ {j} \\ = P M T \left[ \left(1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + r) ^ {t} \right]\right) / r \right] \\ \end{array}
$$ where


$PV =$  Principal amount borrowed through the mortgage

${PMT} =$  Monthly mortgage payment

$r =$  Monthly interest rate on the mortgage (equals the nominal annual interest rate,  $i$ , divided by 12 [months per year])

$t =$  Number of months (payments) over the life of the mortgage

For the mortgage in this example:

$$

\$ 120,000 = P M T \left[ \left(1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7) ^ {3 6 0} \right]\right) / 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7 \right]

$$ or:


$$

P M T = \$ 120,000 / \left[ \left(1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7) ^ {3 6 0} \right]\right) / 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7 \right]

$$

Therefore:

$$

P M T = \$ 1 2 0, 0 0 0 / 1 3 6. 2 8 3 5 = \$ 8 8 0. 5 2

$$

Thus, your monthly payment is 880.52.

We now construct the amortization schedule for this mortgage.

# EXAMPLE 7-2 Construction of an Amortization Schedule

Using the monthly payment calculated on the mortgage in Example 7-1, we construct a partial amortization schedule in Table 7-1. Column 1 is the month in the 360-month loan period. Column 2 is the balance of the mortgage outstanding at the beginning of each month. Column 3 is the monthly payment on the mortgage, calculated in Example 7-1. Column 4, Interest, is the portion of the monthly payment that represents the pure interest payment based on the loan balance outstanding at the beginning of the month (beginning loan balance \times 8\% /12). Column 5, Principal, is the portion of the monthly payment that represents the repayment of the mortgage's principal (monthly payment - monthly interest, or in this example for month 1, \ 880.52 - \ 800 = \$ 80.52) . Column 6 is the balance of the mortgage principal outstanding at the end of the month (beginning loan balance

[columns 2] - principal [column 5]). This value becomes the beginning balance in the next month. The full amortization schedule is shown in Appendix 7A to the chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor).

Notice that the total payments made by the mortgage borrower over the 30-year life of the mortgage are  $316,987.20. Of this amount,$ 120,000 is repayment of the original principal. Thus, the borrower pays a total of 196,978.20 in interest over the life of the mortgage. Figure 7-7 illustrates the proportion of each payment that is interest versus principal. Notice that during the early years the majority of each payment is interest and very little goes toward the repayment of principal. As the mortgage approaches maturity the majority of each payment is principal and very little goes to paying interest.

$$

\left(\left\{1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + r) ^ {(3 0 (1 2) - x)} \right] \right\} / r\right) / \left(\left\{1 - \left[ (1 + r) ^ {3 0 (1 2)} \right] \right\} / r\right) \times \text {O r i g i n a l p r i n c i p a l}

$$

For example, with 120 payments remaining on the loan, the ending loan balance is:

$$

\left(\left\{1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7) ^ {3 0 (1 2) - 1 2 0} \right] \right\} / 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7\right) / \left\{\left. 1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7) ^ {(3 0) 1 2} \right] \right\} / 0. 0 0 6 6 6 7\right) \times \\ \\ \$ 120,000 = \$ 105,269.64

$$

As discussed, an advantage of a 15-year mortgage to a mortgage borrower is that the total interest paid on a 15-year mortgage is smaller than that paid on a 30-year mortgage. This is due to the shorter time frame in which payments are made on the loan and the lower interest rates that are offered by mortgage issuers to entice borrowers to choose the shorter maturity mortgages.

# CALCULATOR HINTS

CPT PMT = 1,095.44

# EXAMPLE 7-3 Comparison of Interest Paid on a 15-Year versus a 30-Year Mortgage

Using the information in Example 7-1 but changing the loan maturity to 15 years (180 months) and the mortgage rate to 7.25 percent, the monthly payment on the 120,000 mortgage loan is:

$$

\$ 120,000 = P M T [ (1 - [ 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 0 4 1 6 7) ^ {1 8 0} ]) / 0. 0 0 6 0 4 1 6 7 ]

$$ or:


$$

P M T = \$ 120,000 / [ (1 - 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 0 4 1 6 7) ^ {1 8 0}) ] / 0. 0 0 6 0 4 1 6 7 ]

$$

Therefore:

$$

P M T = \$ 1 2 0, 0 0 0 / 1 0 9. 5 4 5 4 7 7 = \$ 1, 0 9 5. 4 4

$$

Solving for PMT, the monthly mortgage payment is 1,095.44. Table 7-2 shows the corresponding loan amortization schedule.

Total payments on the 15-year mortgage are  $197,179.20, of which$ 77,179.20 is interest. This compares to interest of  $196,987.20 on the 30-year mortgage (a difference of$ 119,808.00, disregarding time value of money). The mortgage borrower's interest payments are reduced significantly with the 15-year mortgage relative to the 30-year mortgage. However, the borrower must pay $1,095.44 per month with the 15-year mortgage compared to $880.52 with the 30-year mortgage, a difference of 214.92 per month. This may be difficult if the borrower's income level is not very high.

Another factor that affects the amortization of a loan is whether the borrower pays discount points up front in exchange for a reduced interest rate and, consequently, reduced monthly payments.

# EXAMPLE 7-4 Analyzing the Choice between Points and Monthly Payments of Interest

You plan to purchase a house for $150,000 using a 30-year mortgage obtained from your local bank. You will make a down payment of 20 percent of the purchase price, in this case, equal to $30,000. Thus, the mortgage loan amount will be 120,000. Your bank offers you the following two options for payment:

Option 1: Mortgage rate of 8 percent (or  $8\% / 12 = 0.6667\%$  per month) and zero points.
Option 2: Mortgage rate of 7.75 percent (or 7.75\% /12 = 0.6458\% per month) and 2 points (\ 2,400 = \$ 120,000\times 0.02)

If option 2 is chosen, you receive  $117,600 at closing ($ 120,000 - $2,400), although the mortgage principal is $120,000.

To determine the best option, we first calculate the monthly payments for both options as follows:

Option 1: $120,000 = PMT[(1 + [1/(1 + 0.006667)360])/0.006667] → PMT = $880.52
Option 2: $120,00 = PMT[(1 + [1/(1 + 0.006458)360])/0.006458] → PMT = $859.69

In exchange for  $2,400 up front, option 2 reduces your monthly mortgage payments by$ 20.83. The amortization schedules for the two loans are given in Appendix 7A to the chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor). The present value of these savings (evaluated at 7.75 percent) over the 30 years is:

$$

P V = \$ 20.83 [ (1 - [ 1 / (1 + 0. 0 0 6 4 5 8) ^ {3 6 0} ]) / 0. 0 0 6 4 5 8 ] = \$ 2, 9 0 6. 5 4

$$

Option 2 is the better choice. The present value of the monthly savings,  $\2,906.54$ , is greater than the points paid up front, \2,400.

Suppose, however, you plan on paying off the loan in 10 years (120 months) even though the mortgage has a 30-year maturity. Since option 2 (the mortgage with points) has a lower interest rate, the principal remaining each month prior to maturity is lower. The lower interest rate means that a larger amount of each month's payment can go to pay off the principal on the mortgage. At 120 months, the principal balance remaining on option 1 (the no points mortgage) is 105,269.26, while the principal remaining on option 2 (the points mortgage) is 104,720.52 (see Appendix 7A). The difference in principal balance to be paid after 120 months (548.74) must also be included in the calculation. Now the monthly savings from option 2 have a present value of:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P V = \$ 20.83 \left[ \left(1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + 0.006458) ^ {120} \right]\right) / 0.006458 \right] + \$ 548.74 / (1 + 0.006458) ^ {120} \\ = \$ 1,989.12 \\ \end{array}

$$

Option 1 becomes the better deal. The present value of the monthly savings,  $\1,989.12$ , is less than the points paid up front, \2,400.

The indifference point (the number of years) between the two options would be the point where the difference in interest payments (25.00),² equals the up-front payment, 2,400. As mentioned above, the lower interest rate on option 2 results in the remaining principal being lower each month prior to maturity of the mortgage and thus, a lower payoff amount on early payoff by the mortgage borrower. Thus, we use the difference in interest payments (rather than the difference in total payments, 20.83) to identify the indifference point between the two mortgages. To find the point at which you are indifferent between the two options, you solve the following equation:

$$

\$ 2,400 = \$ 25 \left[ \left(1 - \left[ 1 / (1 + 0.006458) ^ {x} \right]\right) / 0.006458 \right]

$$

Solving for  $X$  gives 150 months, or 12.5 years. Thus, if you plan on paying off the mortgage in 12.5 years or less, option 1 is the better deal. If you plan on paying off the mortgage in more than 12.5 years, option 2 is preferred.

Notice that the choice of points (and lower monthly payments) versus no points (and higher monthly payments) depends on how long the mortgage borrower takes to pay off the mortgage. Specifically, the longer the borrower takes to pay off the mortgage, the more likely he or she is to choose points and a lower mortgage rate. Thus, by offering points, the mortgage lender decreases the probability that the mortgage borrower will prepay the mortgage—paying the mortgage off early reduces the present value of the monthly savings to the mortgage borrower.

# Other Types of Mortgages

LG 7-5

New methods of creative financing have been developed by financial institutions to attract mortgage borrowers. These include jumbo mortgages, subprime mortgages, Alt-As, option ARMs, second mortgages, and reverse-annuity mortgages.

# jumbo mortgages

Mortgages that exceed the conventional mortgage conforming limits.

Jumbo Mortgages. Jumbo mortgages are those mortgages that exceed the conventional mortgage conforming limits. Limits are set by the two government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (discussed below), and are based on the maximum value of any individual mortgage they will purchase from a mortgage lender. In 2019, the general limit was 484,350 for most of the United States (the limit is set higher in high cost areas of the country). Because the large size and the inability to sell jumbo mortgages to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac creates more risk for mortgage lenders, interest rates on jumbo mortgages are generally higher than on conforming mortgages. Typically, the spread in interest rates on jumbo versus conventional mortgages is about 0.25 to 0.50 percent. However, during periods of high economywide risk (e.g., during the late 2000s), the spread can be greater than 1.50 percent. Further, to reduce the risk of these loans, lenders will often require a higher down payment on jumbo mortgages than conventional mortgages.

# subprime mortgages

Mortgages to borrowers who have weakened credit histories.

Subprime Mortgages. Subprime mortgages are mortgages to borrowers who do not qualify for prime mortgages because of weakened credit histories, including payment delinquencies and possibly more severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. Subprime borrowers may also display reduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories. Subprime mortgages have a higher rate of default than prime mortgage loans and are thus riskier loans for the mortgage lender. As a result, these mortgages have higher interest rates than prime mortgages. Although the majority of home loans are not subprime mortgages, their numbers grew rapidly in the mid-2000s. Subprime mortgages accounted for 9 percent of all mortgage originations from 1996 through 2004 and rose to about 21 percent from 2004 through 2006. As mentioned earlier, the huge growth in subprime mortgages was a major instigator of the recent financial crisis.

# Alt-A mortgages

Mortgages that are considered riskier than a prime mortgage and less risky than a subprime mortgage.

Alt-A Mortgages. Alt-A mortgages short for Alternative A-paper, are mortgages that are considered riskier than a prime mortgage and less risky than a subprime mortgage. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores, higher loan-to-value ratios, and more investment properties than prime mortgage borrowers, but more extensive documentation, higher credit scores, lower loan-to-value ratios, and fewer investment properties than subprime mortgage borrowers. Therefore, Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. As a result of their less-than-prime credit qualities, Alt-A loans do not meet the standard of conforming mortgages for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

During the recent financial crisis, Alt-A mortgages came under particular scrutiny. One problem associated with Alt-A loans is the lack of necessary proof or documentation needed to be approved for a loan. Thus, some lenders suggested that borrowers skew their incomes or assets in order to qualify for a larger loan. As housing prices fell and the U.S. economy entered a recession, borrowers proved unable to afford their payments. The mortgage lenders, however, still collected a hefty profit, which led to intense scrutiny of their lending practices. As of 2008, there was strong evidence that the securities backing Alt-A mortgages suffered from the same weaknesses as the securities backing subprime mortgages.

# option ARMs

Adjustable rate mortgages that offer the borrower several monthly payment options.

Option ARMs. Option ARMs, also called pick-a-payment or pay-option ARMs, are 15- or 30-year adjustable rate mortgages that offer the borrower several monthly payment options. The four major types of payment options include: minimum payment, interest-only payment, a 30-year fully amortizing payment, and a 15-year fully amortizing payment.

Minimum Payment Option. The minimum payment is the lowest of the four payment options and carries the most risk. With these option ARMs, the monthly payment is set for 12 months at an initial interest rate. After that, the payment changes annually, and a payment cap limits how much it can increase or decrease each year (generally 7.5 percent). If the minimum payment is continued after the end of the initial interest rate period, which usually holds only for the first one to three months, it may not be enough to pay all of the interest charged on the loan for the previous month. In this case, the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance. This is called negative amortization, and it means that the amount owed increases and the borrower is charged additional interest at the rate on the loan times the new, larger principal balance.

The minimum payment on most option ARM programs is 1 percent fully amortized. Every time the borrower makes the minimum payment, the difference between the minimum payment and the interest-only payment (see below) is tacked onto the balance of the loan. A borrower can pay the minimum payment until the loan balance reaches 110 to 115 percent of the original loan balance. This allows the typical borrower to pay the minimum payment for roughly the first five years of the life of the loan. After the loan balance reaches 110 to 115 percent, the borrower loses the minimum payment option, leaving the three remaining payment options.

Interest-Only Payment. An interest-only option ARM requires the borrower to pay only the interest on the loan during the initial period of the loan. During this period, no principal must be repaid. After the interest-only period, the mortgage must amortize so that the mortgage will be paid off by the end of its original term. This means that monthly payments must increase substantially after the initial interest-only period lapses. The length of the interest-only period varies with each mortgage type. The interest-only payment may change every month based on changes in the ARM index used to determine the loan interest rate. After 10 years from the start of the loan, the interest-only option typically goes away as well, and the borrower must pay using one of the two remaining payment options. Interest-only payment option ARMs carry a great deal of payment-shock risk. Not only do the payments have the potential to increase because of an increasing fully indexed interest rate, but the expiration of the interest-only payment means that payments will increase when the mortgage becomes a fully amortizing loan.

30-Year Fully Amortizing Payment. With 30-year fully amortizing option ARMs, the borrower pays both principal and interest on the loan. By making this payment each month, the borrower is ensured that all interest and principal payments are fully paid on schedule, based on a 30-year term. The payment is calculated each month based on the prior month's fully indexed rate, loan balance, and remaining loan term.

15-Year Fully Amortizing Payment. This option ARM is similar to the 30-year fully amortizing payment option ARM, with a full principal and interest payment, but with a larger

# second mortgages

Loans secured by a piece of real estate already used to secure a first mortgage.

# home equity loans

Loans that let customers borrow on a line of credit secured with a second mortgage on their homes.

# reverse-annuity mortgage (RAM)

A mortgage for which a mortgage borrower receives regular monthly payments from a financial institution rather than making them. When the RAM matures (or the borrower dies), the borrower (or the estate of the borrower) sells the property to retire the debt.

amount of principal paid each month. This amount includes all of the interest charged on the loan for the previous month plus principal to pay off the loan based on a 15-year (instead of a 30-year) term. The payment amount may change from month to month based on changes in the index value used to determine the fully indexed rate. Choosing the 15-year fully amortizing payment puts the mortgage on an accelerated amortization schedule.

Second Mortgages. Second mortgages are loans secured by a piece of real estate already used to secure a first mortgage. Should a default occur, the second mortgage holder is paid only after the first mortgage is paid off. As a result, interest rates on second mortgages are generally higher than on first mortgages.

About 15 percent of all primary mortgage holders also have second mortgages. Second mortgages provide mortgage borrowers with a way to use the equity they have built up in their homes as collateral on another mortgage, thus allowing mortgage borrowers to raise funds without having to sell their homes. Financial institutions often offer home equity loans that let customers borrow on a line of credit secured with a second mortgage on their homes. The dollar value of home equity loans issued by U.S. depository institutions and outstanding in September 2019 was  $326 billion, compared to a total of$ 15.84 trillion in total home mortgage loans. Further, the rate of interest financial institutions charged on home equity loans was 5.72 percent compared to 3.16 percent on 15-year fixed-rate first mortgage loans.

Interest on all mortgages (first, second, and home equity) secured by residential real estate is tax deductible. Interest on other types of individual loans—such as consumer loans—is not eligible for a tax deduction.

Reverse-Annuity Mortgages. With a reverse-annuity mortgage (RAM), a mortgage borrower receives regular monthly payments from a financial institution rather than making them. When the RAM matures (or the borrower dies), the borrower (or the borrower's estate) sells the property to retire the debt. RAMs were designed as a way for retired people to live on the equity they have built up in their homes without the necessity of selling the homes. Maturities on RAMs are generally set such that the borrower will likely die prior to maturity.

As the U.S. population ages, RAMs are growing in popularity. Because so many people retire asset-rich and income-poor, RAMs present a way for seniors to unlock some of the value tied up in their home to boost their income. Funds received from a RAM may be used for any purpose, including meeting housing expenses (such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses), as well as other living expenses. RAMs provide a way for retired homeowners to maintain financial independence as well as ownership of their home, but they are more costly than more conventional types of mortgages. Thus, RAMs are attractive mainly to older homeowners who have accumulated substantial equity in their homes.

# SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKETS

Through one of two mechanisms, financial institutions can remove mortgages from their balance sheets, placing them for trading in secondary mortgage markets. First, they can pool their recently originated mortgages together and sell them in the secondary mortgage market. Second, financial institutions can issue mortgage-backed securities, creating securities that are backed by their newly originated mortgages (i.e., securitization of mortgages). In 2019, over 65 percent of all residential mortgages were sold or securitized in this fashion. The sale/securitization of mortgages in the secondary mortgage markets reduces the liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk experienced by the originating financial institution compared to keeping the mortgage in its asset portfolio. For example, depository institutions obtain the majority of their funds from short-term deposits. Holding long-term fixed-rate mortgages in their asset portfolios subjects them to interest rate risk, particularly if interest rates are expected to increase (see Chapter 23). Moreover, selling/securitizing mortgages can generate fee income for the mortgage-originating financial institution and help reduce the effects of regulatory constraints (see Chapter 13).


Many financial institutions such as mortgage companies prefer to concentrate on the servicing of mortgages rather than the long-term financing of them, which occurs if they are kept on the balance sheet. The loan originator may also act as a servicer, collecting payments from mortgage borrowers and passing the required interest and principal payments through to the secondary market investor. The servicer also keeps the formal records of all transactions pertaining to the mortgage. In return for these services, the financial institution collects a monthly fee. Mortgage servicers generally charge fees ranging from 1/4 to 1/2 percent of the mortgage balance.

In this section, we introduce and provide an overview of the secondary mortgage markets, including a discussion of the crucial role they played in the financial crisis of the late 2000s. We look at these markets in more detail, including how financial institutions can use these markets to hedge credit risk on their balance sheets, in Chapter 25.

# History and Background of Secondary Mortgage Markets

The mortgage market is unique in that the U.S. government is deliberately involved in the development of its secondary markets. The secondary mortgage markets were created by the federal government to help boost U.S. economic activity during the Great Depression. As borrowers defaulted on mortgages, banks and thrifts found themselves strapped for cash. To create liquidity in the mortgage markets and to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing, in 1938 the government established the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) to buy mortgages from depository institutions so they could lend to other mortgage borrowers. FNMA's mandate was to act as a secondary mortgage market facility that could purchase, hold, and sell mortgage loans. The government also established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Veterans Administration (VA) to insure certain mortgages against default risk (described earlier). This made it easier to sell/securitize mortgages. Financial institutions originated the mortgages and secondary market buyers did not have to be as concerned with a borrower's credit history or the value of collateral backing the mortgage since they had a federal government guarantee protecting them against default risk. Fannie Mae grew very large over the years. To remove Fannie Mae's growing debt portfolio from the government balance sheet, in 1968 Fannie Mae was converted into a publicly traded company owned by investors.

Further, by the late 1960s, fewer veterans were obtaining guaranteed VA loans. As a result, the secondary market for mortgages declined. To encourage continued expansion in the housing market and to promote competition for FNMA (which was functioning as a virtual monopoly), the U.S. government created the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). Like FNMA, GNMA, and FHLMC provide direct or indirect guarantees that allow for the creation of mortgage-backed securities (we provide a detailed description of each agency below). Also like FNMA, FHLMC became quite large and was converted to a public company in 1989, removing the debt from the balance sheet of the federal government. Thus, while GNMA is a government-owned enterprise, FNMA and FHLMC are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).

As secondary mortgage markets have evolved, a wide variety of mortgage-backed securities have been developed to allow primary mortgage lenders to securitize their mortgages and to allow a thriving secondary market for mortgages to develop. The organizations involved in the secondary mortgage markets (e.g., GNMA, FNMA) differ in the types of mortgages included in the mortgage pools, security guarantees (or insurance), and payment patterns on the securities.

# correspondent banking

A relationship between a small bank and a large bank in which the large bank provides a number of deposit, lending, and other services.

# mortgage sale

Sale of a mortgage originated by a bank with or without recourse to an outside buyer.

# recourse

The ability of a loan buyer to sell the loan back to the originator should it go bad.

# Mortgage Sales

Financial institutions have sold mortgages and commercial real estate loans among themselves for more than 100 years. In fact, a large part of correspondent banking involves small banks making loans that are too big for them to hold on their balance sheets—either for lending concentration risk or capital adequacy reasons—and selling parts of these loans to large banks with whom they have had a long-term deposit and lending correspondent relationship. In turn, large banks often sell parts of their loans, called *participations*, to smaller banks.

A mortgage sale occurs when a financial institution originates a mortgage and sells it with or without recourse to an outside buyer. If the mortgage is sold without recourse, the financial institution not only removes it from its balance sheet but also has no explicit liability if the mortgage eventually goes bad. Thus, the buyer of the mortgage (not the financial institution that originated the loan) bears all the credit risk. If, however, the mortgage is sold with recourse, under certain conditions the buyer can return the mortgage to the selling financial institution. Therefore, the financial institution retains a contingent credit risk liability. In practice, most mortgage sales are without recourse. Mortgage sales usually involve no creation of new types of securities, such as those described below. We discuss loan sales in more detail in Chapter 25.

A major reason that financial institutions sell loans is to manage their credit risk better (see Chapter 21). Mortgage sales remove assets (and credit risk) from the balance sheet and allow a financial institution to achieve better asset diversification. Additionally, mortgage sales allow financial institutions to improve their liquidity risk and interest rate risk situations. Other than risk management, however, financial institutions are encouraged to sell loans for a number of other economic (generation of fee income) and regulatory reasons (including reducing the cost of reserve requirements and reducing the cost of holding required capital against mortgages). The benefits of loan sales are discussed in detail in Chapter 25.

A wide array of potential buyers and sellers of mortgage loans exist. The five major buyers of primary mortgage loans are investment banks, vulture funds, domestic banks, foreign banks, insurance companies and pension funds, closed-end bank loan mutual funds, and nonfinancial corporations. The major sellers of mortgage loans are money center banks, small regional or community banks, foreign banks, investment banks, hedge funds, and the U.S. government. We discuss the motivations of each in Chapter 25.

# Mortgage-Backed Securities

In this section, we introduce the three major types of mortgage-backed securities—the pass-through security, the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), and the mortgage-backed bond. In Chapter 25, we provide a detailed analysis of these securities and the processes by which these mortgage-backed securities are created and used to reduce credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk for an FI. Pass-through securities and CMOs are securitized mortgages. Securitization of mortgages involves the pooling of a group of mortgages with similar characteristics, the removal of these mortgages from the balance sheet, and the subsequent sale of interests in the mortgage pool to secondary market investors. Securitization of mortgages results in the creation of mortgage-backed securities (e.g., government agency securities, collateralized mortgage obligations), which can be traded in secondary mortgage markets. For example, there were 3.14 trillion in outstanding mortgage securitization pools in 2018.

Mortgage-backed securities allow mortgage issuers to separate the credit risk exposure from the lending process itself. That is, FIs can assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants, originate loans, fund loans, and even monitor and service loans without retaining exposure to loss from credit events, such as default or missed payments. This moves banks away from the traditional "originate and hold" banking model, in which the originating bank retains the

# Goldman Reaches 5 Billion Settlement over Mortgage-Backed Securities

In January 2016, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay more than  $5 billion, the largest regulatory penalty in its history. In settling with the Justice Department and a collection of other state and federal entities, Goldman resolved claims stemming from the Wall Street firm's sale of mortgage bonds heading into the financial crisis. It joined a list of other big banks in moving past one of the biggest, and most costly, legal problems of the crisis era. The government had earlier won multibillion-dollar settlements from J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Crisis-related settlements by banks, mortgage firms, brokerages and others total at least$ 181.1 billion.

The investigations examined how Wall Street sold bonds tied to residential mortgages, and whether banks deceived investors by misrepresenting the quality of underlying loans. The government's inquiry into Goldman related to mortgage-backed securities the firm packaged and sold between 2005 and 2007, when the housing market was booming and investor demand for related bonds was strong.


The latest settlement is just one of several that Goldman has paid in relation to the crisis. Goldman agreed to pay  $1.2 billion in penalties to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 to settle claims that it failed to disclose the risks on mortgage bonds it sold. In 2010, the firm agreed to pay$ 550 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint stemming from its handling of a complex mortgage-linked deal. In February 2015, Morgan Stanley reached a preliminary accord with the Justice Department in which the firm agreed to pay  $2.6 billion. That month, Goldman said in a regulatory filing that it had been informed by U.S. officials in December 2014 that it might face a civil lawsuit stemming from the government's mortgage-bond probe. In May, the firm said it was in talks with U.S. and state authorities to resolve those claims. In the settlement, Goldman agreed to pay to the Justice Department a$ 2.385 billion civil monetary penalty. Goldman must also provide 1.8 billion in consumer relief through debt forgiveness to borrowers, the construction and financing of affordable housing, and other programs.


loan and the risk exposure, until the loan is paid off. Rather, mortgage securitization and loan syndication allows banks to retain little or no part of the loans, and hence little or no part of the default risk on loans that they originate: bank have moved to the originate-to-distribute model of banking. Thus, as long as the borrower does not default within the first months after a loan's issuance and the loans are sold or securitized without recourse back to the bank, the issuing bank can ignore longer term credit risk concerns. This decoupling of the risk from the lending activity allows the market to efficiently transfer risk across counterparties. However, it also loosens the incentives to carefully perform each of the steps of the lending process. This loosening of incentives was an important factor leading to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, which witnessed the after-effects of poor loan underwriting, shoddy documentation and due diligence, failure to monitor borrower activity, and fraudulent activity on the part of both lenders and borrowers. The result was a deterioration in credit quality at the same time as there was a dramatic increase in consumer and corporate leverage. Eventually, in 2006, housing prices started to fall. At the same time, the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates as it began to fear inflation. Since many of the subprime mortgages that originated in the 2001-2005 period had adjustable rates, the cost of meeting mortgage commitments rose to unsustainable levels for many low-income households. The result of these events was a wave of mortgage defaults in the subprime market and foreclosures that only reinforced the downward trend in housing prices. As this happened, the poor quality of the collateral and credit quality underlying subprime mortgage pools became apparent, with default rates far exceeding those apparently anticipated by the rating agencies who set their initial subprime mortgage securitizations ratings. The financial crisis began.

Although bank regulators attempt to examine the off-balance-sheet activities of banks so as to ascertain their safety and soundness, these activities receive far less scrutiny than on-balance-sheet activities (i.e., traditional lending and deposit taking). To the extent that counterparty credit risk was not fully disclosed to, or monitored by, regulators, the increased use of these innovations transferred risk in ways that were not necessarily scrutinized or understood. It was in this context of increased risk and inadequate regulation that the credit crisis developed. The After the Crisis box illustrates how, even into 2016, federal securities regulators pursued legal charges against financial institutions over alleged mortgage-backed securities violations. See Chapter 25 for more discussion of this topic.

# pass-through mortgage securities

Mortgage-backed securities that "pass through" promised payments of principal and interest on pools of mortgages created by financial institutions to secondary market participants holding interests in the pools.

www.ginniemae.gov

Pass-Through Securities. Financial institutions frequently pool the mortgages and other assets they originate and offer investors an interest in the pool in the form of pass-through certificates or securities. Pass-through mortgage securities "pass through" promised payments of principal and interest on pools of mortgages created by financial institutions to secondary market investors (mortgage-backed security bond holders) holding an interest in these pools. After a financial institution accepts mortgages, it pools them and sells interests in these pools to pass-through security holders. Each pass-through mortgage security represents a fractional ownership share in a mortgage pool. Thus, a 1 percent owner of a pass-through mortgage security issue is entitled to a 1 percent share of the principal and interest payments made over the life of the mortgages underlying the pool of securities. The originating financial institutions (e.g., bank or mortgage company) or a third-party servicer receives principal and interest payments from the mortgage holder and passes these payments (minus a servicing fee) through to the pass-through security holders. This is a simplification of the process. In actual practice, the mortgages are generally first sold (placed) in a "special purpose vehicle" (SPV) off the balance sheet, and it is this SPV that issues the bonds backed by the mortgages. The details of how pass-through securities are created and operated are provided in Chapter 25. There we also explain how FIs can use these securities to hedge credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk.

Three agencies, either government-owned or government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), are directly involved in the creation of mortgage-backed pass-through securities. Informally, they are known as Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC). Private mortgage issuers, such as banks and thrifts, also purchase mortgage pools, but they do not conform to government-related issuer standards. Table 7-3 reports the amount of mortgage-backed pass-through securities outstanding for each from 1995 through third quarter of 2019. Note the tremendous growth in these securities between 1995 and 2008, and the subsequent drop from 2010 to 2013. As we discuss in Chapter 10, part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis, is the Volcker Rule which prohibits U.S. depository institutions (DIs) from engaging in proprietary trading (i.e., trading as a principal for the trading account of the bank). This includes any transaction to purchase or sell derivatives such as mortgage-backed securities. Thus, only the investment banking arm of the business is allowed to conduct such trading. The Volcker Rule was implemented in April 2014 and banks had until July 21, 2015, to be in compliance. The result has been a reduction in mortgage-backed securities held off-balance-sheet by these financial institutions.

# timing insurance

A service provided by a sponsor of pass-through securities (such as GNMA) guaranteeing the bond holder interest and principal payments at the calendar date promised.

GNMA The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), or Ginnie Mae, began operations in 1968 when it split off from the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), discussed below. GNMA is a government-owned agency with two major functions: sponsoring mortgage-backed securities programs of financial institutions such as banks, thrifts, and mortgage bankers and acting as a guarantor to investors in mortgage-backed securities regarding the timely pass-through of principal and interest payments from the financial institution or mortgage servicer to the bond holder. In other words, GNMA provides timing insurance. In acting as a sponsor and payment-timing guarantor, GNMA supports only those pools of mortgage loans whose default or credit risk is insured by one of four government agencies: the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Veterans Administration (VA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Indian and Public Housing, and the USDA Rural Development. Mortgage loans insured by these agencies target groups that might otherwise be disadvantaged in the housing market, such as low-income families, young families, and veterans. As such, the maximum mortgage under the GNMA securitization program is capped. The cap was generally  $484,350 for a single-family home in 2019. Higher cost areas of the country have a higher limit; the high cost limit in 2019 was$ 726,525.

GNMA securities are issued in minimum denominations of  $25,000. The minimum pool size for GNMA single-family mortgages is$ 1 million. Once a pool of mortgages is packaged by a financial institution in accordance with GNMA specifications, pass-through securities can be issued. Cash flows of interest and principal received from the original mortgages are used to pay the promised payments on the GNMA securities. The mortgages from the pool are used as collateral, guaranteeing the promised payments to the GNMA holders. GNMA requires that all of the mortgages in a pool used to back a particular GNMA pass-through security issue have the same interest rate. Secondary market purchasers of GNMA pass-through securities generally receive 0.50 percent less than the rate on the underlying mortgages. The 0.50 percent is divided between the financial institution that services the mortgages and GNMA, which charges a fee for the provision of its timing insurance.

FNMA. Originally created in 1938, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) is the oldest of the three mortgage-backed security-sponsoring agencies. While, since 1968, FNMA has operated as a private corporation owned by shareholders, in the minds of many investors, it has had implicit government backing, which makes it equivalent to a government-owned enterprise. Indeed, the fact that FNMA has historically had a secured line of credit available from the U.S. Treasury should it need funds in an emergency supports this view. Further, and as discussed in more detail below, on September 7, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) placed Fannie Mae (and Freddie Mac, as discussed below) in conservatorship. As a conservator, the FHFA was given full powers to control the assets and operations of the firms. Dividends to common and preferred shareholders were suspended, but the U.S. Treasury put in place a set of financing agreements to ensure that the GSEs would continue to meet their obligations to bond holders. This means that the U.S. taxpayer basically was the guarantor behind about 5 trillion of GSE debt. This step was taken because a default by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, both of which had been battered by the downturn in housing and credit markets, could have caused severe disruptions in global financial markets, made home mortgages more difficult and expensive to obtain, and had negative repercussions throughout the economy.

FNMA is a more active agency than GNMA in creating pass-through securities. GNMA merely sponsors such programs and guarantees the timing of payments from financial institution servicers to GNMA investors. FNMA actually helps create pass-throughs by buying and holding mortgages on its balance sheet. It also issues bonds directly to finance those purchases. Specifically, FNMA creates mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) by purchasing packages of mortgage loans from banks and thrifts. It finances such purchases by selling MBSs to outside investors such as life insurers or pension funds. In addition, FNMA engages in swap transactions by which it swaps MBSs with a bank or thrift for original mortgages. Since FNMA guarantees securities in regard to the full and timely payment of interest and principal, the financial institution receiving the MBSs can then resell www.freddiemac.com


them in the capital market or can hold them in its own portfolio. Unlike GNMA, FNMA securitizes conventional mortgage loans, as well as FHA/VA insured loans, as long as the conventional loans have acceptable loan-to-value or collateral ratios not normally exceeding 80 percent. Conventional loans with high loan-to-value ratios usually require that the mortgages be insured with private mortgage insurance (see earlier discussion) before they are accepted into FNMA securitization pools.

FHLMC. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or Freddie Mac (FMAC), performs a similar function to that of FNMA except that its major securitization role has historically involved thrifts. Like FNMA, FHLMC is a stockholder-owned corporation, yet it is currently in conservatorship with the FHFA. Further, like FNMA, it buys mortgage pools from financial institutions and swaps MBSs for loans. FHLMC also sponsors conventional mortgage pools and mortgages that are not federally insured as well as FHA/VA mortgage pools and guarantees timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal on the securities it issues.

Private Mortgage Pass-Through Issuers. Private mortgage pass-through issuers (such as commercial banks, thrifts, and private conduits) purchase nonconforming mortgages (e.g., mortgages that exceed the size limit set by government agencies, such as the 417,000 cap set by the FHA), pool them, and sell pass-through securities on which the mortgage collateral does not meet the standards of a government-related mortgage issuer. There are a limited number of private conduits—GE Capital Mortgages, Chase Mortgage Finance, and Citigroup/Citibank Housing. Private mortgage pass-through securities must be registered with the SEC and are generally rated by a rating agency (such as Moody's) in a manner similar to corporate bonds.

(e.g., GNMA, FNMA). Column 1 of the quote lists the sponsor of the issue (e.g., FMAC, FNMA, GNMA), the mortgage coupons on the mortgages in each pool (e.g.,  $4.0\%$ ), and information about the maximum delay between the receipt of interest by the servicer/ sponsor and the actual payment of interest to bond holders. The "GOLD" next to FMAC indicates a maximum stated delay of 55 days. The current market price of a bond is shown in column 2, with the daily price change in column 3. Both prices are in percentages, and the number after the dash is in 32nds ( $e.g., 106 - 24 = 106^{24} / _{32}$ ). Column 4 shows the average life of the bond reflecting the prepayment patterns of homeowners in the pool as estimated by one investment bank (Bear Stearns). Notice these pools of 15- and 30-year mortgages have an expected weighted-average life of no more than 3.8 years. The fifth column in the quote is a measure of the yield spread of the mortgage-backed security over a Treasury bond with the same average life, and column 6 reports the spread change for the day. Column 7 is a measure of the estimated prepayment speed. The prepayment speeds are shown relative to those normally occurring on pass-through securities as estimated by the Public Securities Association (PSA) (now a part of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or SIFMA). Thus, 448 PSA (prepayment speed) means that these MBS mortgage holders are prepaying about 4.5 times quicker than the speed that normally would be expected. This is because interest rates on new mortgages in June 2016 were well below historic levels. We discuss prepayment risk and prepayment speeds as estimated by the PSA in greater detail in Chapter 25. Finally, the last column (8) is the yield to maturity on the mortgage-backed pass-through security. This yield is calculated using the yield to maturity formulas found in Chapter 3, given the contractual income, principal cash flows, and the expected prepayment pattern (based on projections made by Bear Stearns's prepayment model, see Chapter 25).

Government Sponsorship and Oversight of FNMA and Freddie Mac. Together FNMA and FHLMC represent a huge presence in the financial system as they have over 44 percent of the single-family mortgages and mortgage pools in the United States. Some regulators and politicians have argued that these two government-sponsored enterprises have gained too much of a market share. In the early 2000s, their credit losses increased as did their debt-to-equity ratios. Debt to equity for these two agencies ranged from 30 to 97 percent, depending on the assumptions made about off-balance-sheet exposures.

Also, in the early 2000s, these two agencies came under fire for several reasons. First, in September 2002, Fannie Mae was criticized for allowing a sharp increase in interest rate risk to exist on its balance sheet. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), a main regulator of Fannie Mae, required Fannie Mae to submit weekly reports to the OFHEO on the company's exposure to interest rate risk. The OFHEO also instructed Fannie Mae to keep regulators apprised of any challenges associated with returning its interest rate risk measure to more acceptable levels and warned that additional action would be taken if there were adverse developments with Fannie Mae management's effectiveness in lowering interest rate risk. In October 2003, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac came under new criticism for allegedly overcharging lenders for services they provided. The overcharges came in the fees that the companies collect from banks, thrifts, and other lenders for guaranteeing repayment of their mortgages. The overcharges hurt mortgage lenders, squeezing their profit margins, and perhaps home buyers, too, as lenders increased mortgage interest rates to recover the increased fees. Later that same month, Fannie Mae announced that it miscalculated the value of its mortgages, forcing it to make a $1.1 billion restatement of its stockholders' equity. Earlier in the year, Freddie Mac announced a $4.5 billion misstatement of its earnings. While both were claimed to be computational errors, the episodes reinforced fears that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lack the necessary skills to operate their massive and complex businesses, which some investors and political critics worried could pose a risk to the nation's financial system if not properly managed. Finally, in February 2004, then Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose very serious risks to the U.S. financial system and urged Congress to curb their growth sooner rather than later.


Underlying the concerns about the actions of these two GSEs was the widespread perception among investors that neither would be allowed to fail if they got into trouble. This perception created a subsidy for the agencies and allowed them to borrow more cheaply than other firms with similar balance sheets. The fear was that the two agencies used their implicit federal backing to assume more risk and finance expansion through increased debt. Such actions created a source of systemic risk for the U.S. financial system. These fears and concerns became reality during the financial crisis. The turmoil in the housing and credit markets that began in 2007 put extreme financial pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The value of their mortgage assets fell, but the debt they issued to purchase those assets remained on their balance sheets. To maintain a positive net worth in the face of falling asset values, financial firms have several options to raise capital, none of which were readily available to Fannie or Freddie. If they sold assets, they would depress the prices of mortgage loans and MBSs even further, worsening both their own balance sheet positions and those of many other financial firms. They could not use retained earnings to increase capital because their operations had not earned a profit since 2006. Finally, rapidly falling share prices made it difficult to raise capital by selling new common stock.

GSE status, however, enabled them to continue to fund their operations by selling debt securities, because the market believed that Fannie and Freddie debt was implicitly guaranteed by the government. In July 2008, however, Fannie and Freddie's share prices fell sharply, resulting in the possibility that market participants might refuse to extend credit to Fannie and Freddie under any terms (see Figure 7-8). Even though Fannie and Freddie maintained access to the debt markets (albeit at higher than usual interest rates), their inability to raise new capital cast doubts on their long-term viability. As a result, the federal government concluded that "the companies cannot continue to operate safely and soundly and fulfill their critical public mission, without significant action" to address their financial weaknesses.

Figure 7-8 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Stock Prices

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, enacted July 30, 2008, gave the authority for the government's takeover of the GSEs. The act created a new GSE regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), with the authority to take control of either GSE to restore it to a sound financial condition. The act also gave the Treasury emergency authority to purchase an unlimited amount of GSE debt or equity securities if necessary to provide stability to the financial markets, prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage finance, and protect taxpayers. On September 7, 2008, the FHFA established a conservatorship for both Fannie and Freddie. As conservator, the FHFA took over the assets and assumed all the powers of the shareholders, directors, and officers. The FHFA stated that the conservatorship would end when the FHFA finds that a safe and solvent condition has been restored.

Treasury invested in the GSEs by entering into a Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (SPSPA) with each GSE when the GSEs were placed under survivorship. SPSPAs are indefinite in duration, each with funding commitment cap of  $100 billion (the funding commitment caps were raised to$ 200 billion each in May 2009). In exchange for the funding commitment, Treasury immediately received 1 billion of senior preferred stock in each GSE. Treasury also received long-term options (called warrants) for the purchase of 79.9 percent of the common stock of each GSE at a nominal cost. The GSEs agreed to pay Treasury a 10 percent cash dividend on funds received, and dividends were suspended for all other GSE stockholders. If the GSEs had enough profit at the end of the quarter, the dividend came out of the profit. When the GSEs did not have enough cash to pay their dividend to Treasury, they asked for additional cash to make the payment instead of issuing additional stock.

The takeover of Fannie and Freddie, and specifically the commitment to meet all of the firms' obligations to debt holders, exposes the U.S. government to a potentially large financial risk. At the time the FHFA took over, debt issued or guaranteed by the GSEs totaled more than 5 trillion. The risks of not acting, however, clearly appeared intolerable to the government. A failure or default by either Fannie or Freddie would have severely disrupted financial markets around the world. If the GSE portfolios of mortgage loans and MBSs had been liquidated, prices would have plunged even further, the secondary market for mortgages would have been decimated, and the supply of new mortgage credit would have been severely restricted.

To date, Treasury has provided  $119.8 billion to Fannie Mae and$ 71.6 billion to Freddie Mac to keep them solvent. In 2012, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported their first profits since the takeover. On August 17, 2012, the SPSPAs were amended to establish a positive net worth buffer at $3 billion for each GSE that would be incrementally reduced by $600 million each year until reaching zero by 2018. Any net worth proceeds the GSEs received above the (declining) buffer would be paid to Treasury in the form of dividends. By 2018, the GSEs would have paid all quarterly profits (net worth) as dividends to Treasury, referred to as a "profit sweep." If no profits are earned, then no dividend is paid to Treasury. Treasury stated that the profit sweep approach reduces taxpayers' exposure to financial risks and prevents the GSEs from rebuilding capital, thus facilitating the option to wind them down.

In 2017, however, Treasury and FHFA agreed to reinstate the capital reserves to  $3 billion each. By the end of calendar year 2018, Fannie Mae had paid$ 176 billion and Freddie Mac had paid $117 billion in dividends to Treasury. If the profit sweep had not replaced paying dividends to Treasury at a 10 percent annual rate, Fannie Mae would have paid $102 billion and Freddie Mac would have paid $67 billion to Treasury in dividends. On September 30, 2019, Treasury and FHFA announced that Fannie Mae will be allowed to retain $25 billion and Freddie Mac will be able to retain $20 billion as part of a Trump administration process aimed at moving the companies out of conservatorship. By October 2019, the two GSEs paid dividends totaling $306.4 billion.

The FHFA told the two GSEs in October 2019 to prepare for transition out of government control, the latest in a string of developments that push Fannie and Freddie toward being private companies again. The FHFA gave the directive through its 2020 "scorecard" for Fannie and Freddie, an annual document that outlines the FHFA's goals for the two companies. Among the things the scorecard asks Freddie and Fannie to do is to prepare a roadmap toward the end of conservatorship, in consultation with the FHFA, Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In January 2020, the FHFA hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. as it moves toward returning the mortgage companies to private ownership. Shoring up Fannie's and Freddie's financings could entail raising more than  $125 billion, in part by selling new shares in public offerings, according to former company officials and housing experts. In comparison, the largest initial public stock offering ever was$ 25.6 billion raised by Saudi Arabian Oil Co. in December 2019.

6. Which loans should have the highest yields—loans sold with recourse or loans sold without recourse?
7. The three forms of mortgage loan securitization? What are the major differences in the three forms?
8. Why an investor in a securitized asset who is concerned about prepayment risk would prefer a CMO over a pass-through security?

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. Although pass-throughs are still the primary mechanism for securitization, the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is a second vehicle for securitizing financial institution assets that is increasingly used. Innovated in 1983 by FHLMC and First Boston, the CMO is a device for making mortgage-backed securities more attractive to certain types or classes of investors. The CMO does this by repackaging the cash flows from mortgages and pass-through securities in a different fashion.

A pass-through security gives each investor a pro rata share of any interest and principal cash flows on a mortgage pool. By contrast, a CMO can be viewed as a multiclass pass-through with a number of different bond holder classes or tranches. Unlike a pass-through, which has no guaranteed annual coupon, each bond holder class in a CMO has a different guaranteed coupon (paid semiannually) just as a regular T-bond. More importantly, the allocation of any excess cash flows over and above the guaranteed coupon payments due to increased mortgage prepayments goes toward retiring the principal outstanding of only one class of bond holders, leaving all other classes prepayment-protected for a period of time. CMOs give investors greater control over the maturity of the mortgage-backed securities they buy. By comparison, for pass-throughs, the mortgage-backed security holder has a highly uncertain maturity date due to the risk of very rapid prepayments (called prepayment risk) by the mortgagees. We provide a detailed analysis of CMOs and the process by which they are created in Chapter 25.

Mortgage-Backed Bond. Mortgage-backed bonds (MBBs), also called asset-backed bonds, are the third type of mortgage-backed security. These bonds differ from pass-throughs and CMOs in two key dimensions. First, while pass-throughs and CMOs help financial institutions remove mortgages from their balance sheets, mortgages backing MBBs normally remain on the balance sheet. Second, pass-throughs and CMOs have a direct link between the cash flows on the underlying mortgages and the cash flows on the bond instrument issued. By contrast, the relationship for MBBs is one of collateralization rather than securitization; the cash flows on the mortgages backing the bond are not necessarily directly connected to interest and principal payments on the MBB.

Essentially, a financial institution issues an MBB to raise long-term low-cost funds. MBB holders have a first claim to a segment of the financial institution's mortgage assets. Practically speaking, the financial institution segregates a group of mortgage assets on its balance sheet and pledges this group of assets as collateral against the MBB issue. A trustee normally monitors the segregation of assets and ensures that the market value of the collateral exceeds the principal owed to MBB holders. Financial institutions back most MBB issues by excess collateral. This excess collateral backing of the bond, in addition to the priority rights of the bond holders, generally ensures the sale of these bonds with a high investment grade credit rating (BBB or better). In contrast, the financial institution, when evaluated as a whole, could be rated as BB or even lower. A high credit rating results in lower coupon payments than would be required if significant default risk had lowered the credit rating.

5. Some CMOs, however, are issued with planned amortization class (PAC) bonds. PAC bonds offer a fixed principal redemption schedule that is met as long as prepayments on the underlying mortgages remain within a certain range. PACs are designed to protect CMO investors against prepayment risk. See the discussion in Chapter 25.

Weighed against the benefits of MBB issuance are a number of costs. The first cost is that MBBs tie up mortgages on the financial institution's balance sheet for a long time. This decreases the asset portfolio's liquidity. Second, balance sheet illiquidity is enhanced by the need to overcollateralize MBBs to ensure a high-quality credit risk rating for the issue. Third, by keeping the mortgages on the balance sheet, the financial institution continues to be liable for capital adequacy and reserve requirement taxes. Because of these costs, MBBs are the least used of the three basic vehicles of securitization. In Chapter 25, we provide a more detailed analysis of MBBs.

LG 7-9

# PARTICIPANTS IN THE MORTGAGE MARKETS

In this chapter, we have demonstrated that financial institutions are critical in the operations of both the primary and secondary mortgage markets. Some financial institutions (e.g., banks, savings institutions) contribute mainly to the primary mortgage markets. Others (e.g., mortgage companies) contribute to both the primary and secondary markets. Figure 7-9 shows the distribution of mortgages outstanding in 1992, 2007, and 2018 by type of mortgage holder—the ultimate investor.

Notice in Figure 7-9 the growth and decline in the importance of mortgage securitization pools over the period (40.4 percent of all mortgages outstanding in 1992 versus 51.0 percent in 2007 and 20.4 percent in 2018). By contrast, mortgages held by federal and related agencies have grown as a percentage of total mortgages outstanding (0.4 percent in 1992 versus 5.0 percent in 2007 and 35.4 percent in 2018).

Mortgage companies, or mortgage bankers, are financial institutions that originate mortgages and collect payments on them. Unlike banks or thrifts, mortgage companies typically do not hold on to the mortgages they originate. Instead, they sell the mortgages they originate but continue to service the mortgages by collecting payments and keeping records on each loan. Mortgage companies earn income to cover the costs of originating and servicing the mortgages from the servicing fees they charge the ultimate buyers of mortgages. Figure 7-10 shows the distribution of issuers of GNMA securities by type of originating financial institution. Mortgage companies issued 71 percent of all GNMA securities in 2016.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

9. Who the major holders of mortgages are in the United States?
10. Why mortgage companies hold such a small portion of the mortgage market on their balance sheets?

What should be evident from this figure is that, despite originating such a large volume in the mortgage market, the reason for the small investments in mortgages by mortgage companies (as seen in Figure 7-9) is that, while mortgage companies are major originators of home mortgages, they generally do not hold the mortgage loans in their asset portfolios for a long period of time. Rather, mortgage companies sell or securitize most of the mortgages they originate in the secondary market. From these two figures, it should be evident that securitization allows institutional investors (insurance companies, pension plans, mutual funds, hedge funds) to lend indirectly to households through purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Further, it should be noted that in 2011, the three largest banks—Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Bank of America—accounted for 68 percent of GNMA's mortgage-backed securities business. Today, nonbank mortgage lenders are responsible for 71 percent of GNMA MBS issuance. Banks have reduced their GNMA issuance in part due to pressure from the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to enter into major settlements for allegedly careless underwriting of FHA-insured loans.

# INTERNATIONAL TRENDS IN SECURITIZATION

International investors participate in U.S. mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets. Table 7-5 lists the dollar value of primary mortgages issued and held by foreign banking offices in the United States between 1992 and 2018. Notice that the value of mortgages held by foreign banks has decreased over this period by 67.2 percent from  $51.6 billion in 1992 to$ 16.9 billion in 2014, before rebounding to  $77.6 billion in 2018. This compares to primary mortgages issued and held by domestic entities of$ 15.42 trillion in 2018. (see Figure 7-9)—foreign bank offices issue and hold less than 0.50 percent of the total primary mortgage market in the United States.

While they have not evolved to the level of U.S. mortgage markets, securitization vehicles have also been developed for mortgages in countries other than the United States. After the United States, Europe is the world's second-largest and most developed securitization market. Although a form of securitization has been in existence in Europe

Germany is one of the countries that moved toward making widespread use of securitization in its mortgage markets. Thus, like the United States, Germany relies heavily on capital markets to fund new mortgages, rather than relying simply on deposits at banks and other lending institutions. The German secondary mortgage market appears, in fact, to be a very well developed one, having served the country for close to 200 years. But there ends the historical similarity with the United States. In Germany, the capital markets have traditionally funded mortgages through bonds known as Pfandbriefe, which are conceptually distinct from mortgage-backed bonds. The Pfandbriefe are covered bonds, which function similarly to securitization only in that they help raise money from private investors. Otherwise, they differ significantly in their structure.

Since mid-1993, the number of European originators of securitized assets has continued to grow, as have the types of assets that can be securitized and the investor base. Further, securitization costs have fallen, and legislative and regulatory changes in European countries have supported this market's growth. The volume of European securitizations skyrocketed in 1996 and 1997, when European countries securitized a total of  $41.5 billion assets. Despite the world economic crisis in 1998, the European securitization market fell only slightly to$ 38.4 billion. More than $22 billion of securitized vehicles were issued in just the first half of 1999 alone, including $3.5 billion in international deals from Japan. Japan and Europe accounted for $16 billion of the first quarter total. Latin America and the emerging markets (still struggling with economic crises) lagged behind, with issues totaling $7.0 billion.

Table 7-6 reports the value of securitized mortgage issuances in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world from 2002 to 2018. The European securitization market topped  \90.6  billion in 2002 (3.88 percent of the size of mortgage securitizations in the United States),  \698.4  billion in 2007 (31.68 percent of the issuances in the United States), and  \970.5  billion in 2008 (69.14 percent of the issuances in the

United States). European securitizations fell to  $432.7 billion in 2009 (21.20 percent of the size of mortgage securitizations in the United States), and to just$ 213.8 billion in 2015 (12.60 percent of the issuances in the United States). The United Kingdom was the biggest European issuer of mortgage-backed securities in 2015, with over 21 percent of the European market. However, with the UK's 2016 referendum (so-called Brexit) in which citizens voted to leave the European Union, the role that London banks will play in the mortgage-backed securitization market is now in doubt. As it leaves the EU, the UK's ability to trade and interact with the remaining EU nations is no longer without restrictions and must be negotiated as the UK "divorces" itself from the EU. Thus, international banks may decide to leave London for another country in the EU to conduct these financial transactions. In Europe, the factors driving the securitization market include the conversion to a single currency (a factor driving many European markets at the beginning of the 21st century), the effects of globalization of all markets, and the spread of U.S.-style financial securities.

Notice that European mortgage securitization peaked in 2008, then fell dramatically in 2009. This is because, quickly after it hit the United States, the financial crisis spread worldwide. As the crisis spread, banks worldwide saw losses driven by their portfolios of securitized exposures to the subprime mortgage market. Losses were magnified by illiquidity in the markets for those instruments. As with U.S. banks, this led to substantial losses in their marked to market valuations of the securitized mortgages. In Europe, the general picture of bank performance in 2008 was similar to that in the United States. That is, net income fell sharply at all banks. The largest banks in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom had net losses for the year. Banks in Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom were especially hard hit as they had large investments in "toxic" mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, both U.S. and domestic. Because they focused on domestic retail banking, French and Italian banks were less affected by losses on mortgage-backed securities. Continental European banks, in contrast to UK banks, partially cushioned losses through an increase in their net interest margins.

Synthetic securitizations are a far more common form of mortgage financing in countries outside the United States. Synthetic securitization refers to structured transactions in which banks use credit derivatives to transfer the credit risk of a specified pool of assets to third parties, such as insurance companies, other banks, and unregulated entities. Synthetic securitization can replicate the economic risk transfer characteristics of a traditional securitization without actually removing the portfolio of assets from the originating bank's balance sheet. There are numerous reasons for preferring synthetic securitization. The reasons can depend on the regulatory climate of the country in question, as well as the goals of the mortgage originator and arranger. Reasons to prefer synthetic securitization might include the complexity and prohibitive cost of a traditional securitization transaction as well as its potentially unfavorable tax implications. The important point to remember in a synthetic securitization is that the owner of the assets remains the owner and does not actually pass legal title to other investors, unlike in a traditional securitization.

# SUMMARY

In this chapter, we examined the primary and secondary mortgage markets. For several reasons, mortgages are analyzed separately from other capital market securities (e.g., bonds and stocks). We identified several characteristics associated with mortgages and various categories of primary mortgage markets. We also provided an overview of the secondary mortgage markets. The sale and securitization of mortgages allows financial institutions to reduce interest rate risk exposure experienced when mortgages are left in the asset portfolios for the entire life of the mortgage. We look at the details of the securitization process in a risk-return framework in Chapter 25.
