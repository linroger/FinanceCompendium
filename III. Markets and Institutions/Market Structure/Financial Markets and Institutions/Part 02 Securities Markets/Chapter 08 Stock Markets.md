# THE STOCK MARKETS: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Stock markets allow suppliers of funds to efficiently and cheaply get equity funds to public corporations (users of funds). In exchange, the fund users (firms) give the fund suppliers ownership rights in the firm as well as cash flows in the form of dividends. Thus, corporate stock or equity serves as a source of financing for firms, in addition to debt financing or retained earnings financing. In the 1990s, the market value of corporate stock outstanding increased faster than any other type of financial security. Figure 8-1 shows the market value of corporate stock outstanding in the United States in 1994, 2007, and 2018 by type of issuer. Notice that from 1994 through 2018, stock values increased 582 percent, compared to 390 percent growth in bond values (see Figure 6-1) and 239 percent growth in primary mortgage market values (see Figure 7-1). However, stock prices fell precipitously during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. At the end of the third quarter 2007, U.S. stock market values peaked at  \$26.4 trillion before falling to\$ 13.9 trillion in March 2009, a loss of 47.3 percent in less than  $1\frac{1}{2}$  years. Stock prices recovered along with the economy in the last half of 2009 and 2010, doubling in value from March 2009 to March 2010. However, it took until March 5, 2013, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) to surpass its pre-crisis high of 14,164.53, closing at 14,253.77 for the day. To date, the DJIA's all-time record close stands at 29,551, seen on February 12, 2020.

Legally, holders of a corporation's common stock or equity have an ownership stake in the issuing firm that reflects the percentage of the corporation's stock they hold. Specifically, corporate stockholders have the right to a share in the issuing firm's profits, as in dividend payments, after the payment of interest to bond holders and taxes. They also have a residual claim on the firm's assets if the company fails or is dissolved after all debt and tax liabilities are paid. Bond holders, on the other hand, are creditors of the issuing firm. They have no direct ownership interest in the firm, but they have a superior claim to the firm's earnings and assets relative to that of stockholders.

Common stockholders have voting privileges on major issues in the firm, such as the election of the board of directors. It is the board of directors, through the firm managers, who oversee the day-to-day operations of the firm. The board is charged with ensuring that the firm is being run so as to maximize the value of the firm (i.e., the value of its equity and debt claims). Thus, while stockholders have no direct control over a firm's day-to-day operations, they do decide on who will oversee these operations and they can replace the board when they feel the firm is not being run efficiently from a value-maximizing perspective.

The secondary market for corporate stock is the most closely watched and reported of all financial security markets. Daily television and newspaper reports include recaps of the movements in stock market values (both in the United States and abroad). This is because stock market movements are sometimes seen as predictors of economic activity and performance. This is also because corporate stocks may be the most widely held of all financial securities. Most individuals own stocks either directly or indirectly through pension fund and mutual fund investments, and thus their economic wealth fluctuates closely with that of the stock market.

In this chapter, we present a description of equity or stock securities and the markets in which they trade. We begin with a description of the different types of corporate stock. We next look at how they are sold to the public and then traded: first in primary markets (the original sale) and then in secondary markets (the markets for resale). We also review the major stock market indexes. We look at the participants in stock markets and other issues relating to those markets (such as the link between stock market indexes and overall economic activity, the efficiency of the stock market, and regulations covering stock market operations). We conclude the chapter with an examination of international participation in U.S. stock markets and some characteristics of foreign stock markets.

# STOCK MARKET SECURITIES

LG8-1

Two types of corporate stock exist: common stock and preferred stock. While all public corporations issue common stock, many do not offer preferred stock. The market value of preferred stock outstanding is only about 1 percent of the value of common stock outstanding.

# common stock

The fundamental ownership claim in a public or private corporation.

# Common Stock

Common stock is the fundamental ownership claim in a public or private corporation. Many characteristics of common stock differentiate it from other types of financial securities (e.g., bonds, mortgages, preferred stock). These include (1) discretionary dividend payments, (2) residual claim status, (3) limited liability, and (4) voting rights. These characteristics are described next.

Dividends. While common stockholders can potentially receive unlimited dividend payments if the firm is highly profitable, they have no special or guaranteed dividend rights. The payment and size of dividends are determined by the board of directors of the issuing firm (who are elected by the common stockholders). Unlike interest payments on debt, a corporation does not default if it misses a dividend payment to common stockholders. Thus, common stockholders have no legal recourse if dividends are not received, even if a company is highly profitable and chooses to use these profits to reinvest in new projects and firm growth. In fact, many firms pay no dividends, but instead reinvest all of their net earnings in the firm. For example, in 2019, 82 of the firms listed in the S&P 500 Index (see below) paid no dividends.

Another drawback with common stock dividends, from an investor's viewpoint, is that they are taxed twice—once at the firm level (at the corporate tax rate, by virtue of the fact that dividend payments are not tax deductible from the firm's profits or net earnings) and once at the personal level (at the personal income tax rate). Investors can partially avoid this double taxation effect by holding stocks in growth firms that reinvest most of their earnings to finance growth rather than paying larger dividends. Generally, earnings growth leads to stock price increases. Thus, stockholders can sell their stock for a profit and pay capital gains taxes rather than ordinary income taxes on dividend income. Under current tax laws, capital gains tax rates are lower than ordinary income tax rates. For example, from 2013 to 2017, ordinary income tax rates ranged from 10 percent to 36.9 percent of an individual's taxable income. Long-term (a 12-month or longer investment horizon) capital gains tax rates were capped at 20 percent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 maintained the status quo for taxes on long-term capital gains but changed the ordinary income tax rates to a range of 10 percent to 37 percent starting in 2018.

The return to a stockholder over a period  $t - 1$  to  $t$  can be written as:

$$
R_{t} = \frac{P_{t} - P_{t - 1}}{P_{t - 1}} + \frac{D_{t}}{P_{t - 1}}
$$ where


$$

P_{t} = \text{St oc kp ri ce at ti me} t

$$

$$

D_{t} = \text{Di vi de nd s} t - 1 \text{to} t

$$

$$

\frac{P_{t} - P_{t - 1}}{P_{t - 1}} = \text{Ca pi ta lg ai no ve rt im e} t - 1 \text{to} t

$$

$$

\frac{D_{t}}{P_{t - 1}} = \text{Re tu rn}

$$

In the context of the return equation, the reinvestment of earnings (rather than payment of dividends) affects both return components: capital gains and dividends. By reinvesting earnings (rather than paying dividends), the dividend component of returns,  $D_{t} / P_{t - 1}$ , decreases. However, the reinvestment of earnings generally results in a relatively larger increase in the capital gains component,  $(P_{t} - P_{t - 1}) / P_{t - 1}$ .

# EXAMPLE 8-1 Payment of Dividends versus Reinvestment of Earnings

A corporation has after- (corporate) tax earnings that would allow a \$2 dividend per share to be paid to its stockholders. If these dividends are paid, the firm will be unable to invest in new projects, and its stock price, currently \$50 per share, probably will not change. The return to the firm's stockholders in this case is:

$$

R_{t} = \frac{\mathbb {S} 50 - \mathbb {S} 50}{\mathbb {S} 50} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 2}{\mathbb {S} 50} = 4 \%

$$

Suppose a stockholder bought the stock at the beginning of the year (at  \$50) and sold it at the end of the year (at\$ 50). The stockholder's ordinary income tax rate is 30 percent and the capital gains tax rate is 20 percent. (The capital gains tax rate depends on several things, including the holding period of the investment, the investor's income level, and any tax-code changes made during the holding period.) The return to the stockholder in this case is all in the form of ordinary income (dividends). Thus, the after-tax rate of return to the stockholder is  $4\% (1 - 0.30) = 2.8\%$ .

Alternatively, rather than pay dividends, the firm can use the earnings to invest in new projects that will increase the overall value of the firm such that the stock price will rise to 52 per share. The return to the firm's stockholders in this case is:

$$

R_{t} = \frac{\mathbb {S} 52 - \mathbb {S} 50}{\mathbb {S} 50} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 0}{\mathbb {S} 50} = 4 \%

$$

Further, the return to the stockholder is all in the form of capital gains and is taxed at a rate of 20 percent. Thus, the after-tax rate of return to the stockholder is  $4\%$ $(1 - 0.20) = 3.2\%$ .

# residual claim

In the event of liquidation, common stockholders have the lowest priority in terms of any cash distribution.

# limited liability

No matter what financial difficulties the issuing corporation encounters, neither it nor its creditors can seek repayment from the firm's common stockholders. This implies that common stockholders' losses are limited to the original amount of their investment.

**Residual Claim.** Common stockholders have the lowest priority claim on a corporation's assets in the event of bankruptcy—they have a **residual claim**. Only after all senior claims are paid (i.e., payments owed to creditors such as the firm's employees, bond holders, the government (taxes), and preferred stockholders) are common stockholders entitled to what assets of the firm are left. For example, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 left its shareholders with nothing. The residual claim feature associated with common stock makes it riskier than bonds as an investible asset.

Limited Liability. One of the most important characteristics of common stock is its limited liability feature. Legally, limited liability implies that common stockholder losses are limited to the amount of their original investment in the firm if the company's asset value falls to less than the value of the debt it owes. That is, the common stockholders' personal wealth held outside their ownership claims in the firm are unaffected by bankruptcy of the corporation—even if the losses of the firm exceed its total common stock ownership claims. In contrast, sole proprietorship or partnership stock interests mean the stockholders may be liable for the firm's debts out of their total private wealth holdings if the company gets into financial difficulties and its losses exceed the stockholders' ownership claims in the firm. This is the case of "unlimited" liability.

Voting Rights. A fundamental privilege assigned to common stock is voting rights. While common stockholders do not exercise control over the firm's daily activities (these activities are overseen by managers hired to act in the best interests of the firm's common stockholders and bond holders), they do exercise control over the firm's activities indirectly through the election of the board of directors. Stockholders also vote on major changes pertaining to the firm (e.g., mergers and dividend changes). For example, in February 2016, diagnostics company Alere was forced to delay a proposed 5.8 billion

# dual-class firms

Two classes of common stock are outstanding, with differential voting and/or dividend rights assigned to each class.

# cumulative voting

All directors up for election are voted on at the same time. The number of votes assigned to each stockholder equals the number of shares held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected.

acquisition by Abbott. A shareholder lawsuit accused Alere of misleading investors by stating that its financial reporting failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles. The plaintiffs, a group of individual investors, cited a federal probe into the company's accounting for overseas sales arguing that Alere had not adhered to those principles. The lawsuit said Alere failed to disclose "material adverse facts" about the company that eventually threw its merger with Abbott into doubt. Alere's shares dropped about 18 percent to 40.51 after Abbott CEO Miles White declined to respond directly when asked whether he would reaffirm Abbott's commitment to the Alere deal. The deal had been approved by the boards of both companies but was subject to approval by Alere shareholders.

The typical voting rights arrangement is to assign one vote per share of common stock. However, some corporations are organized as dual-class firms, in which two classes of common stock are outstanding, with different voting and/or dividend rights assigned to each class. For example, inferior voting rights have been assigned by (1) limiting the number of votes per share on one class relative to another (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares are entitled to 1/10,000th vote per share, while Class A shares are entitled to one vote per share), (2) limiting the fraction of the board of directors that one class can elect relative to another (e.g., Reinsurance Group of America Class B common stock has the right to elect at least 80 percent of the members of the board of directors, while the holders of Class A common stock have the right to elect no more than 20 percent of the members of the board), or (3) a combination of these two (e.g., the Molson Coors Brewing Company allows holders of Class B common stock the right to elect three directors to the Molson Coors board of directors and the right to one vote per share on other specified transactional actions, while the right to vote for all other activities remains exclusively with Class A common stock). To offset the reduced voting rights, inferior class shares are often assigned higher dividend rights. For example, no dividends are paid on the Class B common shares of Berkshire Hathaway unless equal or greater dividends are paid on the Class A stock. Dual-class firms have often been used in corporations owned and controlled by a single family or group turning to the public market to raise capital through the issue of new shares. To retain voting control over the firm, the family or group issues the dual classes of stock, keeping the high voting stock for themselves and selling the limited voting shares to the public. In all other respects the shares of the two classes are often identical. Because dual classes of stock have often been used by a small group (i.e., family managers) to entrench themselves in the firm, dual-class firms are controversial.

Shareholders exercise their voting rights, electing the board of directors by casting votes at the issuing firm's annual meeting or by mailing in a proxy vote (see below). Two methods of electing a board of directors are generally used: cumulative voting and straight voting. Cumulative voting is required by law in some states (e.g., Arizona and Illinois) and is authorized in others. With cumulative voting, all directors up for election, as nominated by the shareholders and selected by a committee of the board, are voted on at the same time. The number of votes assigned to each stockholder equals the number of shares held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. A shareholder may assign all of his or her votes to a single candidate for the board or may spread them over more than one candidate. The candidates with the highest number of total votes are then elected to the board. Cumulative voting permits minority stockholders to have some real say in the election of the board of directors, since less than a majority of the votes can affect the outcome.

# EXAMPLE 8-2 Cumulative Voting of a Board of Directors

Suppose a firm has 1 million shares of common stock outstanding and three directors up for election. With cumulative voting, the total number of votes each shareholder may cast equals the number of shares owned multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. Thus, the total number of votes available is 3,000,000 (= 1 million shares outstanding × 3 directors).

If there are four candidates for the three board positions, the three candidates with the highest number of votes will be elected to the board and the candidate with the fewest total votes will not be elected. In this example, the minimum number of votes needed to ensure election is one-fourth of the 3 million votes available, or 750,000 votes. If one candidate receives 750,000, the remaining votes together total 2,250,000. No matter how these votes are spread over the remaining three director candidates, it is mathematically impossible for each of the three to receive more than 750,000. This would require more than  $3 \times 750,000$  votes, or more than the 2,250,000 votes that remain.


For example, if candidate 1 receives 750,000 votes, and votes for the other three candidates are spread as follows:

$$

\text{Ca nd id at e} 2 = 2 \text{mi ll io nv ot es}

$$

$$

\text{Ca nd id at e} 3 = 1 5 0, 0 0 0 \text{vo te s}

$$

$$

\text{Ca nd id at e} 4 = 1 0 0, 0 0 0 \text{vo te s}

$$ for a total of 3 million votes cast, candidates 1, 2, and 3 are elected to the board. Alternatively, votes for the other three candidates can be spread as:


$$

\text{Ca nd id at e} 3 = 7 5 1, 0 0 0 \text{vo te s}

$$

$$

\text{Ca nd id at e} 2 = 7 5 0, 0 0 0 \text{vo te s}

$$

$$

\text{Ca nd id at e} 4 = 7 4 9, 0 0 0 \text{vo te s}

$$

Again, candidates 1, 2, and 3 are elected. Indeed, any distribution of the remaining 2,250,000 votes will ensure that candidate 1 is one of the top three vote getters and will be elected to the board. The number of shares needed to elect  $p$  directors,  $N_{p}$ , is

$$

N_{p} = \left[ (P \times \text{Nu mb er of vo te sa va il ab le}) / (\text{Nu mb er of di re ct or st ob ee le ct ed} + 1) \right] + 1

$$ or, in our example, to ensure the election of candidates 1 and 2, a stockholder would need


$$

N_{p} = \left[ (2 \times 3, 0 0 0, 0 0 0) / (3 + 1) \right] + 1 = 1, 5 0 0, 0 0 1 \mathrm{sh ar es}

$$ and these would be split as 750,001 for candidate 1 and 750,000 for candidate 2.


# proxy

A voting ballot sent by a corporation to its stockholders. When returned to the issuing firm, a proxy allows stockholders to vote by absentee ballot or authorizes representatives of the stockholders to vote on their behalf.

# LG 8-2

# preferred stock

A hybrid security that has characteristics of both bonds and common stock.

With straight voting, the vote on the board of directors occurs one director at a time. Thus, the number of votes eligible for each director is the number of shares outstanding. Straight voting results in a situation in which an owner of over half the voting shares can elect the entire board of directors. The state of Delaware allows only straight voting of directors, unless a company specifically affirmatively "opts in" to cumulative voting in its certificate of incorporation. Because of the advantages of straight voting to large stockholders (often corporate insiders or institutional investors), over 50 percent of all publicly traded corporations are incorporated in Delaware.

Proxy Votes. Most shareholders do not attend annual meetings. Most corporations anticipate this and routinely mail proxies to their stockholders prior to the annual meeting. A completed proxy returned to the issuing firm allows stockholders to vote by absentee ballot or authorize representatives of the stockholders to vote on their behalf. It is estimated that, on average, less than 30 percent of the total possible votes are cast at corporate meetings. However, use of the Internet may increase this number in the future. By the 2010s, virtually all U.S. firms were putting proxy statements online and allowing votes to be cast via the Internet. The entire documentation delivery process can be electronically automated with the use of services such as Computershare or Automatic Data Processing's (ADP's) ProxyVote. Official documentation is delivered in electronic form to shareholders, who log onto the system with a control number or personal identification number and vote for or against the resolutions presented.

# Preferred Stock

Preferred stock is a hybrid security that has characteristics of both bonds and common stock. Preferred stock is similar to common stock in that it represents an ownership interest in the issuing firm, but like a bond it pays a fixed periodic (dividend) payment. Preferred stock is senior to common stock but junior to bonds. Therefore, preferred stockholders are paid only when profits have been generated and all debt holders have been paid (but before common stockholders are paid). Like common stock, if the issuing firm does not have sufficient profits to pay the preferred stock dividends, preferred stockholders cannot force the firm into bankruptcy. Further, if the issuing firm goes bankrupt, preferred stockholders are paid their claim only after all creditors have been paid, but before common stockholders are paid.


Corporations find preferred stock beneficial as a source of funds because, unlike coupon interest on a bond issue, dividends on preferred stock can be missed without fear of bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, preferred stock is beneficial to an issuing firm's debt holders. Funds raised through a preferred stock issue can be used by the firm to fund the purchase of assets that will produce income needed to pay debt holders before preferred stockholders can be paid.

However, preferred stock also has its drawbacks for corporations. The first drawback is that, if a preferred dividend payment is missed, new investors may be reluctant to make investments in the firm. Thus, firms are generally unable to raise any new capital until all missed dividend payments are paid on preferred stock. In addition, preferred stockholders must be paid a rate of return consistent with the risk associated with preferred stock (i.e., dividend payments may be delayed). Therefore, preferred stock may be a costlier source of funding for the issuing firm than bonds.

A second drawback of preferred stock from the issuing firm's viewpoint is that, unlike coupon interest paid on corporate bonds, dividends paid on preferred stock are not a tax-deductible expense—preferred dividends are paid out of after-tax earnings. This raises the cost of preferred stock relative to bonds for a firm's shareholders. Specifically, this difference in the tax treatment between coupon interest on debt and preferred stock dividends affects the net profit available to common stockholders of the firm.

Dividends on preferred stock are generally fixed (paid quarterly) and are expressed either as a dollar amount or a percentage of the face or par value of the preferred stock.

# EXAMPLE 8-3 Calculation of Preferred Stock Dividends

Suppose you own a preferred stock that promises to pay an annual dividend of 5 percent of the par (face) value of the stock (received in quarterly installments). If the par value of the stock is 100, the preferred stockholder will receive:

$$

\text{An nu al di vi de nd s} = \$ 1 0 0 \times 0. 0 5 = \$ 5

$$ or:


$$

\text{Qu ar te rl yd iv id en d} = \$ 5 \div 4 = \$ 1. 2 5

$$ at the end of each quarter.


Alternatively, the preferred stock could promise to pay an annual dividend of 5 per year in quarterly installments.

# nonparticipating preferred stock

Preferred stock in which the dividend is fixed regardless of any increase or decrease in the issuing firm's profits.

# cumulative preferred stock

Preferred stock in which missed dividend payments go into arrears and must be made up before any common stock dividends can be paid.

Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights in the firm. An exception to this rule may exist if the issuing firm has missed a promised dividend payment. For example, preferred stock in Pitney Bowes, Inc. has no voting rights except when dividends are in arrears for six quarterly payments. In this case, preferred stockholders can elect one-third of the board of directors. Further, most preferred stock may be converted to common stock in the firm at any time the investor chooses.

Typically, preferred stock is nonparticipating and cumulative. Nonparticipating preferred stock means that the preferred stock dividend is fixed regardless of any increase or decrease in the issuing firm's profits. Cumulative preferred stock means that any missed dividend payments go into arrears and must be made up before any common stock dividends can be paid. For example, during the peak of the financial crisis in late 2008, the federal government instituted the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), a component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The CPP involved the U.S. Treasury's investment

# participating preferred stock

Preferred stock in which actual dividends paid in any year may be greater than the promised dividends.

# noncumulative preferred stock

Preferred stock in which dividend payments do not go into arrears and are never paid.

in hundreds of financial institutions. In return, the U.S. Treasury received shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock carried a 5 percent cumulative dividend rate for the first five years and then reset to a 9 percent dividend.

In contrast, participating preferred stock means that actual dividends paid in any year may be greater than the promised dividends. In some cases, if the issuing firm has an exceptionally profitable year, preferred stockholders may receive some of the high profits in the form of an extra dividend payment. In others, the participating preferred stock pays and changes dividends along the same lines as common stock dividends. Participating preferred stock is frequently used by private equity investors and venture capital firms. In a deal with participating preferred stock, preferred stockholders receive the full return of their investment before any other money is paid out, and then also participate in the distribution of the remaining proceeds, up to an agreed-upon multiple (often two or three times) of the investment. If preferred stock is noncumulative, missed dividend payments do not go into arrears and are never paid. For example, Doral Financial Corp.'s noncumulative preferred stock entitles stockholders to monthly dividends based on an annual rate of 0.151 per share. In 2009, Doral suspended dividend payments on the preferred stock. The dividends did not go into arrears. Noncumulative preferred stock is generally unattractive to prospective preferred stockholders. Thus, noncumulative preferred stock generally has some other special features (e.g., voting rights) to make up for this drawback.

# PRIMARY AND SECONDARY STOCK MARKETS

Before common stock can be issued by a corporation, shares must be authorized by a majority vote of both the board of directors and the firm's existing common stockholders. Once authorized, new shares of stock are distributed to existing and new investors through a primary market sale with the help of investment banks. Once issued, the stocks are traded in secondary stock markets (such as the NYSE or NASDAQ—see below).

In this section, we examine the process involved with the primary sale of corporate stock. We also describe the secondary markets, the process by which stocks trade in these markets, and the indexes that are used to summarize secondary stock market value changes.

# Primary Stock Markets

Primary stock markets are markets in which corporations raise funds through new issues of stocks. The new stock securities are sold to initial investors (suppliers of funds) in exchange for funds (money) that the issuer (user of funds) needs. As illustrated in Figure 8-2, most primary market transactions go through investment banks (e.g., Morgan Stanley or Bank of America Merrill Lynch—see Chapter 16), which serve as the intermediary between the issuing corporations (fund users) and ultimate investors (fund suppliers) in securities.

Like the primary sale of bonds (discussed in Chapter 6), the investment bank can conduct a primary market sale of stock using a firm commitment underwriting (where the investment bank guarantees the corporation a price for newly issued securities by buying the whole issue at a fixed price from the corporate issuer) or a best efforts underwriting basis (where the underwriter does not guarantee a price to the issuer and acts more as a placing or distribution agent for a fee). In a firm commitment underwriting, the investment bank purchases the stock from the issuer for a guaranteed price (called the net proceeds) and resells it to investors at a higher price (called the gross proceeds). The difference

between the gross proceeds and the net proceeds (called the underwriter's spread) is compensation for the expenses and risks incurred by the investment bank with the issue. We discuss these costs in more detail in Chapter 16.

Often an investment bank will bring in a number of other investment banks to help sell and distribute a new issue—called a syndicate. For example, in Figure 8-3, the stock issue announcement of 6,250,000 shares of common stock in Acadia Pharmaceuticals lists the syndicate of eight investment banks involved in the initial issue. The investment banks are listed according to their degree of participation in the sale of new shares. The lead banks in the syndicate (e.g., BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan Securities), which directly negotiate with the issuing company on behalf of the syndicate, are the originating houses. Once an issue is arranged and its terms set, each member of the syndicate is assigned a given number of shares in the issue for which it is responsible for selling. Shares of stock issued through a syndicate of investment banks spread the risk associated with the sale of the stock among several investment banks. A syndicate also results in a larger pool of potential outside investors, increasing the probability of a successful sale and widening the scope of the investor base.

A primary market sale may be a first-time issue by a private firm going public (i.e., allowing its equity, some of which was held privately by managers and venture capital investors, to be publicly traded in stock markets for the first time). These first-time issues are also referred to as initial public offerings (IPOs) discussed in Chapter 16. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 resulted in a large decline in IPO activity. Indeed, the U.S. IPO

# seasoned offering

The sale of additional securities by a firm whose securities are currently publicly traded.

market virtually seized up, with a record-setting stretch of inactivity that began in August 2008 and ended in November 2008, and only 20 IPOs for all of 2008. Starting from 2010, U.S. IPO market has been strong, with the exception of 2016. Compared to 100 IPOs in 2016, there were 176, 214, and 196 IPOs in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

In addition, a primary market sale may be a seasoned offering, in which firm already has shares of stock trading in the secondary markets.

In both cases, the issuer receives the proceeds of the sale and the primary market investors receive the securities. Like the primary sales of corporate bond issues, corporate stocks may initially be issued through either a public sale (where the stock issue is offered to the general investing public) or a private placement (where stock is sold privately to a limited number of large investors).

# preemptive rights

A right of existing stockholders in which new shares must be offered to existing shareholders first in such a way that they can maintain their proportional ownership in the corporation.

Preemptive Rights. Corporate law in some states, and some corporate charters, gives shareholders preemptive rights to the new shares of stock when they are issued. This means that before a seasoned offering of stock can be sold to outsiders, the new shares must first be offered to existing shareholders in such a way that they can maintain their proportional ownership in the corporation. A "rights offering" generally allows existing stockholders to purchase shares at a price slightly below the market price. Stockholders can then exercise their rights (buying the allotted shares in the new stock) or sell them. The result can be a low-cost distribution of new shares for a firm (i.e., the issuing firm avoids the expense of an underwritten offering).

# EXAMPLE 8-4 Calculation of Shares Purchased through a Rights Offering

Suppose you own 1,000 shares of common stock in a firm with 1 million total shares outstanding. The firm announces its plan to sell an additional 500,000 shares through a rights offering. Thus, each shareholder will be sent 0.5 right for each share of stock owned. One right can then be exchanged for one share of common stock in the new issue.

Your current ownership interest is 0.1 percent (1,000/1 million) prior to the rights offering and you receive 500 rights  $(1,000 \times 0.5)$  allowing you to purchase 500 of the new shares. If you exercise your rights (buy the 500 shares), your ownership interest in the firm after the rights offering is still 0.1 percent  $[(1,000 + 500) / (1\text{ million} + 500,000)]$ . Thus, the rights offering ensures that every investor can maintain his or her fractional ownership interest in the firm.

Suppose the market value of the common stock is  \$40 before the rights offering, or the total market value of the firm is\$ 40 million ( \$40 × 1 million), and the 500,000 new shares are offered to current stockholders at a 10 percent discount, or for\$ 36 per share. The firm receives \$18 million ( \$36 × 500,000). The market value of the firm after the rights offering is\$ 58 million (the original \$40 million plus the \$18 million from the new shares), or \$38.67 per share (58 million ÷ 1.5 million).

Your 1,000 shares are worth $40,000 ($40 × 1,000) before the rights offering, and you can purchase 500 additional shares for $18,000 ($36 × 500). Thus, your total investment in the firm after the rights offering is \$58,000, or \$38.67 per share (\$58,000 ÷ 1,500). Suppose you decide not to exercise your preemptive right. Since each right allows a stockholder to buy a new share for \$36 per share when the shares are worth \$38.67, the value of one right should be \$2.67. Should you sell your rights rather than exercise them, you maintain your original 1,000 shares of stock. These have a value after the rights offering of \$38,667 (1,000 × 38.67). You could also sell your rights to other investors for $1,333 (500 × $2.67). As a result, you have a total wealth level of \$40,000—you have lost no wealth.

In 2016, S&W Seed Company (SANW) announced a rights offering to its common stockholders intended to raise  \$10.375 million in new stock at a subscription price of\$ 4.15 per share—that is, to issue 2.5 million new shares of common stock. Each

# red herring prospectus

subscription right allowed shareholders to purchase 0.0937646 of a share of S&W Seed's stock. S&W Seed common stock traded between  \$4.10 and\$ 4.32 per share during the period of the rights offering. Thus, right holders could purchase new shares in S&W Seed at a discount of as much as 0.17 per share from the market price of the stock. These rights could be sold by S&W Seed common stockholders to other investors. Rights are similar to options in that they give the holder the option, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at a fixed price (see Chapter 10). The rights holder has the option of buying the new shares at the stated price, selling the rights to other investors, or letting the rights expire at the end of the offering period unused.

Registration. In a public sale of stock, once the issuing firm and the investment bank have agreed on the details of the stock issue, the investment bank must get SEC approval in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Registration of a stock can be a lengthy process. We illustrate the process in Figure 8-4. The process starts with the preparation of the registration statement to be filed with the SEC. The registration statement includes information on the nature of the issuer's business, the key provisions and features of the security to be issued, the risks involved with the security, and background on the management. The focus of the registration statement is on full information disclosure about the firm and the securities issued to the public at large. At the same time that the issuer and its investment bank prepare the registration statement to be filed with the SEC, they prepare a preliminary version of the public offering's prospectus called the red herring prospectus. The red herring prospectus is similar to the registration statement but is distributed to potential equity buyers. It is a preliminary version of the official or final prospectus that will be printed upon SEC registration of the issue and makes up the bulk of the registration statement. Firms use the feedback provided from the distribution of the red herring prospectus to help set the price on the new shares to ensure the sale of the full issue.

After submission of the registration statement, the SEC has 20 days to request additional information or changes to the registration statement. It generally takes about 20 days for the SEC to declare whether or not a registration statement is effective. First-time or infrequent issuers can sometimes wait up to several months for SEC registration, especially if the SEC keeps requesting additional information and revised red herring prospectuses. However, companies that know the registration process well can generally obtain registration in a few days. This period of review is called the waiting period.

Once the SEC is satisfied with the registration statement, it registers the issue. At this point, the issuer (along with its investment bankers) sets the final selling price on the shares, prints the official prospectus describing the issue, and sends it to all potential buyers of the issue. Upon issuance of the prospectus (generally the day following SEC registration), the shares can be sold.

The period of time between the company's filing of the registration statement with the SEC and the selling of shares is referred to as the "quiet period." Historically, the issuing company could send no written communication to the public during the quiet period www.sec.gov

other than information regarding the normal course of business. Once a company registered with the SEC for a public offering it could engage in oral communication only. That meant the company executives could go on so-called roadshows to solicit investors or have brokers call potential investors to discuss the offering. But they could not provide any written communication, such as faxes or letters, or give interviews about the company's offering. These rules, adopted in 1933, did not foresee new technology, such as the Internet and e-mail. Moreover, these outdated rules may have hurt investors by giving them too little information. Thus, in December 2005, the SEC enacted a rule change giving large companies (market capitalization of at least  \$700 million or with at least\$ 1 billion in debt) more freedom to communicate with investors during the quiet period. Specifically, these companies are now allowed to communicate with investors at any time prior to a public offering through e-mail, letters, or even TV ads, as long as the information is also filed with the SEC. Such communication was previously prohibited.

Further, in December 2005, the SEC enacted an overhaul in the issuing process for stock IPOs that facilitated greater use of the Internet to disseminate information to the markets. Although the use of the Internet was not forbidden by the SEC, prior rules put issuers in legal jeopardy if they departed from the formal written prospectuses and face-to-face roadshows. Under the new rules, the SEC formally allows Internet broadcasts of roadshows. Retail investors can view roadshow presentations while the company is on the road at www. retailroadshow.com. These online broadcasts are open to all investors, not just the chosen few invited to previously closed-door presentations. In fact, the rules encourage broad Internet roadshow dissemination, giving investment banks that open them to the public a break from certain filing requirements. Furthermore, issuers and investment bankers are able to forgo sending final offering prospectuses to IPO investors. Under the SEC's new rules, issuers still have to distribute preliminary (red herring) prospectuses to potential investors. But realizing that most investors get offering documents electronically anyway, the SEC wanted to allow issuers to e-mail investors when a stock price is set, tell them their allocations, and point out that a formal prospectus would soon be filed with the SEC.

# shelf registration

Allows firms that plan to offer multiple issues of stock over a two-year period to submit one registration statement summarizing the firm's financing plans for the period.

In order to reduce the time and cost of registration, yet still protect the public by requiring issuers to disclose information about the firm and the security to be issued, the SEC passed a rule in 1982 allowing for "shelf registration." As illustrated in Figure 8-5, shelf registration allows firms that plan to offer multiple issues of stock over a two-year period to submit one registration statement as described above (called a master registration statement). The registration statement summarizes the firm's financing plans for the two-year period. Thus, the securities are shelved for up to two years until the firm is ready to issue them. Once the issuer and its investment bank decide to issue shares during the two-year shelf registration period, they prepare and file a short form statement with the SEC. Upon SEC approval, the shares can be priced and offered to the public usually within one or two days of deciding to take the shares "off the shelf."

Thus, shelf registration allows firms to get stocks into the market quickly (e.g., in one or two days) if they feel conditions (especially the price they can get for the new stock) are right, without the time lag generally associated with full SEC registration. For example, in

# Secondary Stock Markets

Secondary stock markets are the markets in which stocks, once issued, are traded—that is, bought and sold by investors. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) system are well-known examples of secondary markets in stocks. When a transaction occurs in a secondary stock market, funds are exchanged, usually with the help of a securities broker or firm acting as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller of the stock. The original issuer of the stock is not involved in this transfer of stocks or funds. In this section, we look at the major secondary stock markets, the process by which a trade occurs, and the major stock market indexes.

Stock Exchanges. The two major U.S. stock markets are the New York Stock Exchange Euronext (NYSE Euronext) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) system. Prior to its acquisition by the NYSE in 2008, the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) was a third major stock exchange. Figures 8-6 and 8-7 present data comparing the three stock markets. Figure 8-6 shows dollar volume of trading in each market from 1979 through 2018; Figure 8-7 shows the number of companies listed in each market from 1975 through 2018. Obvious from these trading volume and listing figures is that, while historically the NYSE was the premier stock market, the NASDAQ has become a strong second market. Other smaller stock exchanges include the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (also called the NASDAQ OMX PHLX), and the Boston Stock Exchange (now the NASDAQ OMX BX). These account for no more than 5 percent of daily U.S. stock market volume.

The New York Stock Exchange. Worldwide, the New York Stock Exchange Euronext (NYSE Euronext) is the most well known of all the organized exchanges. The exchange was created by the merger of NYSE Group, Inc. and Euronext N.V. (which was created from the mergers of the Paris Bourse, the Brussels Exchange, and the Amsterdam Exchange in 2000) on April 4, 2007. NYSE Euronext, which merged six cash equities exchanges in five countries and six derivatives exchanges, is the world leader for listings, trading in cash equities, equity and interest rate derivatives, bonds, and the distribution of market data. The merger was the largest of its kind and the first to create a truly global stock market.

Prior to this merger, in May 2006 the NYSE went public, allowing shares of the world's largest stock exchange to trade for the first time. The offering followed the NYSE's merger with publicly traded electronic exchange operator Archipelago Holdings. NYSE Euronext operates four equity markets in the United States: NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT, and ArcaEdge. The NYSE (the largest and most well known of the four) and the NYSE Arca markets are both registered securities exchanges for the listing and trading of equities, fixed-income products (primarily corporate bonds), and structured products such as electronically traded funds (ETFs). The American Stock Exchange was renamed NYSE Amex after its acquisition and then NYSE MKT in 2012. This market focuses on the listing and trading of smaller companies. Finally, ArcaEdge trades include over-the-counter (OTC) and pink sheet stocks (stocks that trade very inactively because of their low price or limited geographic interest). As of December 2018, 2,285 different stocks are listed and traded on the NYSE Euronext. The daily average dollar volume of trading in 2018 was 77 billion.

As discussed in Chapter 5, as a result of the LIBOR scandal, in July 2013 the British government announced that LIBOR would be sold to NYSE Euronext. Since its inception in the 1980s, LIBOR was managed by the British Bankers' Association (a London-based trade group whose members are some of the world's biggest banks). While ownership of LIBOR would be based in the United States, responsibility for regulating it would remain in the United Kingdom. Also in 2013, the European Commission gave unconditional approval to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to buy NYSE Euronext for 8.2 billion. This followed votes by stockholders of both organizations approving the sale. ICE, a leader in the development of electronic trading, announced that it would operate dual headquarters in Atlanta and New York, stressed that it has no current plans to shut down the NYSE's famous trading floor, and said that it would keep the NYSE Euronext name and continue to operate the company's trading floor at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets in Lower Manhattan. The combined ICE-NYSE Euronext would be the third-largest exchange group globally, behind Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing and the CME Group.

LG 8-5

The Trading Process. All transactions occurring on the NYSE occur at a specific place on the floor of the exchange (called a trading post)—see Figure 8-8. Each stock is assigned a special market maker (a specialist). The market maker is like a monopolist with the power to arrange the market for the stock. In return, the specialist has an affirmative obligation to stabilize the order flow and prices for the stock in times when the market becomes turbulent (e.g., when there is a large imbalance of sell orders, the specialist has an obligation to buy the stock to stabilize the price).


Because of the large amount of capital needed to serve the market-making function, specialists often organize themselves as firms (e.g., Brendan E. Cryan and Company, Citadel Securities, GTS Securities, IMC Financial Markets, and Virtu Americas). Specialist firms on the NYSE range in size from 2 to over 20 members. Specialist firms may be designated to serve as the market maker for more than one stock. However, only one specialist is assigned to each stock listed on the exchange. In general, because specialists are obligated to establish the fair market price of a stock and must even occasionally step in and stabilize a stock's price, underwriters/investment banks (responsible for getting the best available price for their customers' new issues) are rarely allowed by the Exchange to become specialists.

Three types of transactions can occur at a given post: (1) brokers trade on behalf of customers at the "market" price (market order), (2) limit orders are left with a specialist to be executed, and (3) specialists transact for their own account. These types of trades are discussed in more detail below. As of December 2005, trading licenses are needed to make trades on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. These trading licenses are made available by means of a Dutch auction through a process called the Stock Exchange Auction Trading System (SEATS). Only a member organization of NYSE is eligible to bid for one of the 1,400 available trading licenses. Each trading license entitles its member organization holder to have physical and electronic access to the trading facilities of the NYSE market. Trading licenses are sold at an auction and are good for one calendar year only.

Generally, as illustrated in Figure 8-9, when individuals want to transact (e.g., purchase) on the NYSE, they contact their broker (such as Wells Fargo Securities). The broker then sends the order to its representative at the exchange (called a commission broker) or to a floor broker (working for themselves) to conduct the trade with the appropriate designated market maker (DMM) in the stock (e.g., Citadel Securities, LLC). Large brokerage firms generally own several "trading licenses" on the floor filled by their commission brokers trading orders for the firm's clients or its own accounts. One of the DMM's jobs is to execute orders for floor and commission brokers. However, these brokers can transact at a post with others without DMM participation. DMMs participate in only about 10 percent of all shares traded. Also, orders are increasingly coming from the public using online (Internet) trading, bypassing the commission broker and going directly to the floor broker (see Chapter 16). Once the transaction is completed (generally in less than 15 minutes), the investor's broker is contacted and the trade is confirmed. Generally, the transaction is settled in three days (so-called settlement at  $\mathrm{T} + 3$ )—that is, the investor has three days to pay for the stock and the floor or commission broker has three days to deliver the stock to the investor's broker.

# market order

An order to transact at the best price available when the order reaches the post.

# limitorder

An order to transact at a specified price.

# order book

A DMM's record of unexecuted limit orders.

The vast majority of orders sent to floor or commission brokers are of two types: market orders or limit orders. A market order is an order for the broker and the DMM to transact at the best price available when the order reaches the post. The floor or commission broker will go to the post and conduct the trade. Before 2005, the best price meant that brokers were required to enter only their very best bid and offer prices for a stock at a specified time into a public electronic database of stock quotes. In 2004, the SEC proposed an overhaul of the rules that radically altered the way the best price would be established: Brokers seeking the best price on a trade would have to enter all their bids and offers for a stock into the public database. This would enable other brokers who wanted to fill orders, including large block trades, to "sweep" all markets for the best price and to simultaneously execute trades in the same stock across different markets. The so-called intermarket sweep would allow brokers to pick off the best prices among all accessible quotes. So a customer (like an individual investor) who wants to buy shares of stock could get chunks of that order filled at the best price across various markets. The change introduces more computerization into the trading process and reduces the amount of NYSE trading conducted via the auction system overseen by specialist firms.

A limit order is an order to transact only at a specified price (the limit price). When a floor or commission broker receives a limit order, he or she will stand by the post with the order if the current price is near the limit price. When the current price is not near the limit price, a floor or commission broker does not want to stand at the post for hours (and even days) waiting for the current price to equal the limit price on this single limit order. In this case, the floor broker enters the limit order on the order book of the DMM at the post. The DMM, who is at the post at all times when the market is open, will monitor the current price of the stock and conduct the trade when, and if, it equals the limit price. Some limit orders are submitted with time limits. If the order is not filled by the time date for expiration, it is deleted from the market maker's book. The third type of trade is that of a DMM trading for his or her own account.

Figure 8-10 illustrates the link between a market order and a limit order. When a market order is placed, the transaction occurs at the current market price,  \$97.75 per share, determined by the intersection of investors' aggregate supply (S) of and demand (D) for the stock. If the limit order price (e.g.,\$ 97.625 per share) differs from the current market price, the order is placed on the DMM's book. If supply and/or demand conditions change (e.g., the demand curve in Figure 8-10 falls to D') such that the market price falls to 97.625 per share, the DMM completes the limit order and notifies the floor broker who submitted the order.

Program Trading. The NYSE has defined program trading as the simultaneous buying and selling of a portfolio of at least 15 different stocks valued at more than 1 million, using computer programs to initiate the trades. For example, program trading can be used to create portfolio insurance. A program trader can take a long position in a portfolio of stocks and a short position in a stock index futures contract (see Chapter 10). Should the market value of the stock portfolio fall, these losses are partly offset by the position in the futures contract. The timing of these trades is determined by the computer program.

2. Similar to a limit order, a stop order is an order to sell a stock when its price falls to a particular point.
3. Many other types of orders may be made as well. A complete list of order types available on the NYSE can be found at the NYSE website, www.nyse.com.

Figure 8-10 Price on a Market Order versus a Limit Order

Program trading has been criticized for its impact on stock market prices and increased volatility. For example, on May 6, 2010, the financial markets experienced a brief but severe drop in prices, falling 998 points (more than 5 percent) in a matter of minutes, only to recover a short time later. The original focus was that computer trading, coupled with the market's complex trading systems, triggered the free fall that appeared to have begun with an order to sell a single stock, Procter & Gamble. A few days later, the fall was attributed to a  \$7.5 million hedge fund trade placed for 50,000 option contracts in the Chicago options trading pits. Another potential culprit was a so-called fat finger error, when a Citigroup trader accidentally entered a sell billion-sized trade when he or she meant to enter a million-sized trade. Regulators eventually found no evidence that the fall was caused by erroneous (fat finger) orders, computer hacking, or terrorist activity. Rather, the "flash crash" was attributed to trading by a little-known mutual fund—Asset Strategy Fund—located in Kansas City. A fund trader triggered the fall with the sale of\$ 4.1 billion of futures contracts linked to the S&P 500 Index. The trader used a computer algorithm that tied the sale to the market's overall volume. Trading volume soared on May 6 and the sell order was executed. While similar trades had taken several hours to execute, this trade was executed in 20 minutes. Regardless of how this historic drop started, it was exacerbated by computer trading. The initial trade triggered a pyramiding effect from computerized trading programs designed to sell when the market moves lower.

As a result of the potential for increased volatility created by program trading, the New York Stock Exchange introduced trading curbs (or circuit breakers) on trading. Circuit breakers are limitations placed on trading when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falls significantly. Circuit breakers are an imposed halt in trading that gives buyers and sellers time to assimilate incoming information and make investment choices. Circuit breakers promote investor confidence by giving investors time to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility (Figure 8-11).

Also as a result of the flash crash, circuit breakers, termed in this case limit up-limit down (LULD) rules, were instituted for individual stocks. Figure 8-12 shows the rules put in place in 2016. Phase I began in April 2013 for Tier I stocks (S&P 500, Russell 1000 stocks, and selected exchange-traded products), while phase II began in August 2013 for Tier II stocks (all other stocks). The LULD band structure is based on percentages away from a "reference price." Specifically, trading is halted (put in a "limit state") if the stock price moves outside the price band, as follows:

Price band  $=$  (Reference price)  $\pm$  [(Reference price)  $\times$  (Percentage parameter)]

In the event of a 7 percent decline in the S&P:

The reference price is the mean price of reported transactions over the past 5 minutes. If no trades have occurred in the previous 5 minutes, the previous reference price will remain. The first reference price of the day is set as the opening price on the stock's primary listing exchange. When a stock is outside the applicable LULD band, trading is halted for 15 seconds. For example, an S&P 500 stock with a reference price of  \$5.00 would see trading halted if its price moved outside a range of$ 4.75—$5.25 ( \$5.00 ± 0.05 ×5.00). Trading may begin after the halt if the entire size of all limit state quotations is executed or canceled within 15 seconds of entering the limit state. If the market does not exit the limit state within 15 seconds, then the primary listing market for the security will declare a 5 minute trading pause. During a trading pause, no trades in the security can be executed, but all bids and offers may be displayed. Percentage parameters are doubled during the first 15 and last 25 minutes of trading.

In the late 1980s, about 15 million shares were traded per day on the NYSE as program trades. In 2018, almost 60 percent of the average daily volume involved program trading. The most active program traders are investment banks (e.g., Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital) conducting trades for their own accounts or those of their customers (e.g., insurance companies, hedge funds, pension funds). Much of this program trading involves index funds (e.g., Vanguard's 500 Index Fund, which seeks to replicate the S&P 500 Index—see below) and futures contracts on various indexes (e.g., S&P 500 Index futures—see Chapter 10). Investment in these index funds grew in the 1980s through the 2000s as a result of the relatively poor performance (in terms of returns) of specialized mutual funds (see Chapter 17) and the strong performance in the major indexes.

Controversial Trading Practices. With the advent of powerful, high-speed computers and with traders' search for ever-increasing ways to trade, some controversial trading practices have arisen.

Flash trading is a controversial practice in which, for a fee, traders are allowed to see incoming buy or sell orders milliseconds earlier than general market traders. With this very slight advance notice of market orders, these traders can conduct rapid statistical analysis (with the help of powerful computers) and carry out high-frequency trading (trades involving very short holding periods) ahead of the public market. Exchanges claim that the flash trading benefits all traders by creating more market liquidity and the opportunity for price improvement. Critics contend that flash trading creates a market in which certain traders can unfairly exploit others. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 gave the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) expanded powers to investigate and prosecute disruptive trading practices, including those by high-speed flash traders. For example, in 2013 the CFTC investigated whether high-frequency traders are routinely distorting stock and futures markets by illegally acting as buyer and seller in the same transactions. Such transactions, known as wash trades, are banned by U.S. law because they can feed false information into the market and be used to manipulate prices. CFTC examiners have found that several hundred thousand potential wash trades occur daily on futures exchanges. Regulators are also requiring exchanges to improve their oversight of high-speed trading in the wake of computer-driven glitches in 2012, including the case of Knight Capital Group, which incurred losses of more than 450 million when a high-speed trading algorithm malfunctioned.

Naked access trading allows some traders and others to rapidly buy and sell stocks directly on exchanges using a broker's computer code without exchanges or regulators always knowing who is making the trades. The firms, usually high-frequency traders, are then able to shave microseconds from the time it takes to trade. A report says that 38 percent of all U.S. stock trading is now done by firms that have "naked sponsored access" to markets. The SEC, fearing that a firm trading anonymously in this way could trigger destabilizing losses and threaten market stability if its rapid-fire trades go awry, banned naked access trading in late 2010.

Dark pools of liquidity are trading networks (e.g., crossing networks) that provide liquidity but that do not display trades on order books. This is useful for traders such as institutional traders who wish to buy and sell large numbers of shares without revealing their trades to the overall market. Dark pool trading offers institutional investors many of the efficiencies associated with trading on the NYSE or NASDAQ, but it does not require that they show their transactions to others. Dark pool trades are recorded to a national database. However, they are recorded as over-the-counter transactions. Thus, detailed information about the volume and type of transaction is left to the trading network to report to its clients if they so desire. In 2019, nearly 39 percent of daily stock trading was processed through dark pools, up from 3 percent in 2008. Dark pool trading has been criticized as unfair. With dark pool trading, traders who use trading strategies based on liquidity do not have access to all trading information.

As a result of these unfair advantages and the new powers given to regulators (through the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), in 2013 the SEC approved a plan for new rules requiring dark pools to disclose and detail trading activity on their platforms. Specifically, the SEC called for dark pools and other alternative trading systems to provide more information on how they work. The new rules require such systems to file detailed information about their operations including trading by broker dealer operators on the ATS, which could pose conflicts of interest. What regulators have focused on are the promises the dark pool operators have made to customers about how their orders are being handled and whether high-speed trading firms have the opportunity to trade against those orders. For example, in January 2016 the SEC announced that Barclays Capital and Credit Suisse Securities agreed to settle separate cases finding that they violated federal securities laws while operating dark pools. Barclays agreed to settle the charges by admitting wrongdoing and paying  \$35 million penalties to the SEC and the New York Attorney General (NYAG) for a total of\$ 70 million. Credit Suisse agreed to settle the charges by paying a \$30 million penalty to the SEC, a \$30 million penalty to the NYAG, and \$24.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC for a total of \$84.3 million.

The NASDAQ system provides continuous trading for the most active stocks traded over the counter. Indeed, as seen in Figures 8-6 and 8-7, the NASDAQ currently has more firms listed than the NYSE. Further, during the tech boom in the late 1990s, the dollar volume of trading on the NASDAQ exceeded that on the NYSE. As the tech boom crashed in the early 2000s, however, the NYSE again saw the greatest dollar and share volume of trading. In 2008-2009, during the financial crisis, the dollar value of trading on the NASDAQ again exceeded that on the NYSE. Trading totaled  \$33.10 trillion on the NASDAQ and\$ 30.92 trillion on the NYSE in 2008 and (hurt by the financial crisis) \$28.95 trillion on the NASDAQ and \$17.78 trillion on the NYSE in 2009. However as markets recovered, the NASDAQ fell back to trading levels below that of the NYSE. In 2018, trading totaled \$16.79 trillion on the NASDAQ and \$19.34 trillion on the NYSE.

The NASDAQ market is primarily a dealer market, in which dealers are the market makers who stand ready to buy or sell particular securities. Unlike the NYSE, many dealers, in some cases more than 20, will make a market for a single stock—that is, quote a bid (buy) and ask (sell) price. There are no limits on the number of stocks a NASDAQ market maker can trade or on the number of market makers in a particular stock. A NASDAQ broker or dealer may also be a member of an organized exchange (e.g., the NYSE). Moreover, the original underwriter of a new issue can also become the dealer in the secondary market—unlike the NYSE, which seeks a separation between underwriters and dealers. Anyone who meets the fairly low capital requirements for market makers on the NASDAQ can register to be a broker-dealer.

An individual wanting to make a trade contacts his or her broker. The broker then contacts a dealer in the particular security to conduct the transaction. In contrast to the NYSE, the NASDAQ structure of dealers and brokers results in the NASDAQ being a negotiated market (e.g., quotes from several dealers are usually obtained before a transaction is made). When a request for a trade is received, a dealer will use the NASDAQ electronic communications network (ECN) to find the dealers providing the inside quotes—the lowest ask and the highest bid. The dealer may also request the quotes of every market maker in the stock. The dealer initiating the trade will then contact the dealer offering the best price and execute the order. The dealer will confirm the transaction with the investor's broker and the customer will be charged that quote plus a commission for the broker's services. Like exchange trading, online (Internet) trading services now allow investors to trade directly with a securities dealer without going through a personal broker.

Because of a lack of liquidity in the NASDAQ market after the 1987 market crash and the negative impact this had on the ability of small traders to transact in this market, NASDAQ implemented a mandatory system, the Small Order Execution System (SOES), to provide automatic order execution for individual traders with orders of less than or equal to 1,000 shares. Market makers must accept SOES orders, which means small investors and traders are provided with excellent liquidity. The SOES allows small investors and traders to compete on a level playing field for access to NASDAQ orders and execution.

For very small firms, NASDAQ maintains an electronic "OTC bulletin board," which is not part of the NASDAQ market but is a means for brokers and dealers to get and post current price quotes over a computer network. These smaller firms are mainly penny stocks, which are stocks traded for less than 5 per share^{5} and generally issued by high-risk firms with short or erratic histories of revenues and earnings. Roughly 30,000 stocks trade on this OTC market. However, this market is not a formal exchange. There are no membership requirements for trading or listing requirements for securities. Thousands of brokers register with the SEC as dealers in these OTC securities, quoting prices at which they are willing to buy or sell securities. A broker executes a trade by contacting a dealer listing an attractive quote. The smallest stocks are listed on "pink sheets" distributed through the National Association of Securities Dealers. These OTC quotations of stock are recorded manually and published daily on pink sheets by which dealers communicate their interest in trading at various prices.

# penny stocks

Stocks that trade for less than 5 per share.

Choice of Market Listing. Firms listed with the NYSE Euronext market must meet the listing requirements of the exchange. The requirements are extensive and can be found at the websites of the exchanges. The basic qualifications are based on such characteristics as firm market value, earnings, total assets, number of shares outstanding, number of shareholders, and trading volume. There are several reasons that NYSE listing is attractive to a firm: improved marketability of the firm's stock (making it more valuable); publicity for the firm, which could result in increased sales; and improved access to the financial markets, as firms find it easier to bring new issues of listed stock to the market. A NYSE-listed firm may also have its securities listed on regional exchanges.

Firms that do not meet the requirements for NYSE Euronext exchange listings trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, most NASDAQ firms are smaller, of regional interest, or unable to meet the listing requirements of the organized exchanges. Many NASDAQ companies are newly registered public issues with only a brief history of trading. Over time, many of these apply for NYSE listing. Not all companies eligible to be listed on the NYSE actually do so. Some companies—for example, Microsoft—believe that the benefits of exchange listing (improved marketability, publicity) are not significant. Others prefer not to release the financial information required by the exchanges for listing.

Electronic Communications Networks and Online Trading. The major stock markets currently open at 9:30 a.m. eastern time and close at 4:00 p.m. eastern time. Extended-hours trading involves any securities transaction that occurs outside these regular trading hours. Almost all extended-hours trading is processed through computerized alternative trading systems (ATSs), also known as electronic communications networks (ECNs) such as NYSE Arca (owned by the NYSE Euronext) and Instinet (owned by NASDAQ). Newer ECNs include BATS (Better Alternative Trading System, founded in Kansas in June 2005, which is now the third-largest exchange in the world, based on volume, behind the NYSE and the NASDAQ) and IEX Group Inc. (which won SEC approval as the United States' 13th national stock exchange in June 2016 and which is the first new stock exchange that uses a "speed bump" that slows the speed of trading by 350 millionths of a second; a delay is just long enough to protect investors from predatory high-speed trading that can front-run the orders of slower investors). ECNs are computerized systems that automatically match orders between buyers and sellers and serve as an alternative to traditional market making and floor trading. They are also the major vehicles for extended-hours trading. ECNs account for approximately one-third of all transactions and almost all extended-hours trading.

As a result of the increased availability of computer technology to individual as well as professional traders in the 1990s, online stock trading via the Internet became one of the biggest growth areas for financial services firms in the late 1990s and into the 2010s. For example, the number of people living in U.S. households that used an online investing/stock trading service within the last 12 months increased from 3 million in 1997 to over 25 million in 2018. Online trading is an area of stock trading that is not likely to go away. The Internet will continue to produce opportunities for investors to communicate with their financial advisors and enact trades without incurring the cost of an office visit. For example, the top-level accounts offered by E*Trade now enable customers to view all of their E*Trade accounts. A client with multiple brokerage accounts as well as bank accounts can view balances for all of these accounts. Customers can also see, in real time, the value of each account, the total value of all accounts together, and how account values have changed. However, with increased trading via high-speed flash trading, naked access, and dark pool trading, the ability for individual traders to "beat the market," even when executing trades via the Internet, is becoming increasingly difficult.

www.wilshire.com stock market indexes as of February 28, 2020. Figure 8-13 shows the trends in some of these indexes (the Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA], the NYSE Composite Index, the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ Composite Index, and the Wilshire 5000 Index) from 1989 through 2019. Notice that movements in these indexes are highly correlated over the 30-year period. Indeed, notice that after a 6-year period of unprecedented growth (1995-2000) for all of these indexes, the early 2000s and the downturn in the U.S. economy produced little growth of these indexes. As the U.S. economy picked up through the first decade of the 2000s, however, all four indexes grew steadily. Finally, notice that all of the indexes experienced large losses in value during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The DJIA closed at an all-time high of 14,164.53 on October 9, 2007. As of mid-March 2009, the DJIA had fallen in value 53.8 percent in less than  $1\frac{1}{2}$  years, larger than the decline during the market crash of 1929 when it fell 49 percent. Similarly, the NYSE Composite, S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Wilshire 5000 indexes all also fell over 50 percent during this period. However, stock prices recovered along with the economy in the last half of 2009 and into 2010, with the DJIA rising 71.1 percent between March 2009 and April 2010. In the spring of 2013, the DJIA surpassed the 2007 high, closing at 14,164.53 on March 5. By the end of 2019, the DJIA was trading at record high of 28,538.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (the DJIA or the Dow) is the most widely reported stock market index. The Dow was first published in 1896 as an index of 12 industrial stocks. In 1928, the Dow was expanded to include the values of 30 large (in terms of sales and total assets) corporations selected by the editors of The Wall Street Journal (owned by Dow Jones & Company). In choosing companies to be included in the DJIA, the editors look for the largest companies with a history of successful growth and with interest among stock investors. The composition of the DJIA was most recently revised in March 2015, when AT&T was replaced by Apple. Table 8-3 lists the 30 NYSE and NASDAQ corporations included in the DJIA. Dow Jones and Company has also established and publishes indexes of 20 transportation companies, 15 utility companies, and a composite index consisting of all 65 companies in the industrial, transportation, and utility indexes. Because the DJIA includes only 30 companies, critics charge that the index fails to reflect the movement of hundreds of other stock prices. But the 30 securities included in the DJIA are chosen to be representative of the broad stock market.

The companies are the major firms in their industries and the stocks are widely held by both individuals and institutions.

Dow indexes are price-weighted averages, meaning that the stock prices of the companies in the indexes are added together and divided by an adjusted value (or divisor), as follows:

$$

\sum_{i = 1}^{3 0} P_{i t} / \text{Di vi so r}

$$ where


$P_{it} =$  Price of each stock in the Dow index on day  $t$

The divisor was set at 30 in 1928, but due to stock splits, stock dividends, and changes in the 30 firms included in the index, this value dropped to 0.147445684 by February 2020.

The NYSE Composite Index. In 1966, the NYSE established the NYSE Composite Index to provide a comprehensive measure of the performance of the overall NYSE market. The index consists of all common stocks listed on the NYSE. In addition to the composite index, NYSE stocks are divided into four subgroups: industrial, transportation, utility, and financial companies. The indexed value of each group is also reported daily.

The NYSE is a value-weighted index, meaning that the current market values (stock price  $\times$  number of shares outstanding) of all stocks in the index are added together and divided by their value on a base date. Any changes in the stocks included in the index are incorporated by adjusting the base value of the index. To modernize and align the index methodology with those used in other indexes, the NYSE revised its NYSE Composite Index in January 2003. At this time the composite was recalculated to reflect a new base value of 5,000 rather than the original base value of 50 set in December 1965.

7. What the major U.S. stock indexes are?

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Standard & Poor's established the S&P 500 Index (a value-weighted index) consisting of the stocks of the top 500 of the largest U.S. corporations listed on the NYSE and the NASDAQ. The NYSE stocks included in the S&P 500 Index account for over 80 percent of the total market value of all stocks listed on the NYSE. Thus, movements in the S&P 500 Index are highly correlated with those of the NYSE Composite Index (the correlation between the two indexes was 0.97 from 1989 through December 2019—see Figure 8-13). Standard & Poor's also reports subindexes consisting of industrials and utilities in the S&P 500 Index.

The NASDAQ Composite Index. Established in 1971, the NASDAQ Composite Index (a value-weighted index) consists of three categories of NASDAQ companies: industrials, banks, and insurance companies. All stocks traded through the NASDAQ in these three industries are included. NASDAQ also reports separate indexes based on industrials, banks, insurance companies, computers, and telecommunications companies.

The Wilshire 5000 Index. The Wilshire 5000 Index was created in 1974 (when computers made the daily computation of such a large index possible) to track the value of the entire stock market. It is the broadest stock market index and possibly the most accurate reflection of the overall stock market. The Wilshire 5000 Index contains virtually every stock that meets three criteria: the firm is headquartered in the United States; the stock is actively traded in a U.S.-based stock market; and the stock has widely available price information (which rules out the smaller OTC stocks from inclusion). Though the index started with 5,000 firms, because of firm delistings, privatizations, and acquisitions it currently includes just 3,618 stocks. Like the NYSE Composite Index, the S&P 500 Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index, the Wilshire 5000 Index is a value-weighted index. The Wilshire 5000 Index has the advantage that it is the best index to track the path of the

# EXAMPLE 8-5 Price-Weighted versus Value-Weighted Indexes

Suppose a stock index contains the stock of four firms: W, X, Y, and Z. The stock prices for the four companies are  $50,$ 25, \$60, and \$5, respectively, and the firms have 100 million, 400 million, 200 million, and 50 million shares outstanding, respectively. If the index is price-weighted, its initial value,  $PWI$ , is calculated as:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P W I = \sum_{i = 1}^{4} P_{i t} / 4 \\ = (\$ 50 + \$ 25 + \$ 60 + \$ 5) / 4 \\ = 1 4 0 / 4 \\ = 3 5 \\ \end{array}

$$

If the index is value-weighted, its initial value, VWI, is:

$$

\begin{array}{l} V W I = \sum_{i = 1}^{4} \left(P_{i t} \times \text{Nu mb er of sh ar es ou ts ta nd in g}\right) / 4 \\ = [ (\$ 50 \times 1 0 0 \mathrm{m}) + (\$ 2 5 \times 4 0 0 \mathrm{m}) + (\$ 6 0 \times 2 0 0 \mathrm{m}) + (\$ 5 \times 5 0 \mathrm{m}) ] / 4 \\ = \$ 6,812.5 \text{mi ll on} \\ \end{array}

$$

If the next day, share prices change to $55, $24, \$62, and \$6, respectively, the price-weighted index value changes to:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P W I = \sum_{i = 1}^{4} P_{i t} / 4 \\ = (\$ 55 + \$ 24 + \$ 62 + \$ 6) / 4 \\ = 1 4 7 / 4 \\ = 3 6. 7 5 \\ \end{array}

$$ and the percentage change in the index is  $(36.75 - 35) / 35 = 5$  percent. The value-weighted index is now:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V W I = \sum_{i = 1}^{4} \left(P_{i t} \times \text{Nu mb er of sh ar es ou ts ta nd in g}\right) / 4 \\ = [ (\$ 55 \times 1 0 0 \mathrm{m}) + (\$ 2 4 \times 4 0 0 \mathrm{m}) + (\$ 6 2 \times 2 0 0 \mathrm{m}) + (\$ 6 \times 5 0 \mathrm{m}) ] / 4 \\ = \$ 6, 9 5 0 \text{mi ll on} \\ \end{array}
$$ and the percentage change in this index is  $(6,950 - 6,812.5) / 6,812.5 = 2.02$  percent.


If, after the market closes, company W undergoes a two-for-one split, its stock price falls to $55/2 = $27.50 and the number of shares increases to 200 million. The prices now sum to 119.50. At the same time the divisor on the price-weighted index adjusts such that:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text{Di vi so r} = 1 1 9. 5 / 3 6. 7 5 \\ = 3. 2 5 1 7 \\ \end{array}

$$

Thus, the value of the price-weighted index remains at:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P W I = \sum_{i = 1}^{4} P_{i t} / 3. 2 5 1 7 \\ = (\$ 2 7. 5 0 + \$ 2 4 + \$ 6 2 + \$ 6) / 3. 2 5 1 7 \\ = 1 1 9. 5 / 3. 2 5 1 7 \\ = 3 6. 7 5 \\ \end{array}

$$

Further, the value-weighted index remains unchanged at 6,950 million. Both indexes are unaffected by the stock split. Apparent from this example, however, is that the firms included in the index and the weighting process used affect the values of the reported changes in the overall stock market.

8. Who the major holders of stock are?
9. What age group of individual investors is the most active in the stock market?

Table 8-4 shows the holdings of corporate stock from 1994 through 2019 by type of holder. Households are the single largest holders of corporate stock (holding 38.0 percent of all corporate stock outstanding in 2019). Mutual funds and foreign investors (rest of the world) are also prominent in the stock markets (holding 23.5 percent and 15.9 percent of the 47.5 trillion in corporate stock outstanding, respectively). Households indirectly invest in corporate stock through investments in mutual funds and pension funds. Together, these holdings totaled approximately 74 percent in 2019. Notice the drop in corporate stock held by the various groups before (third quarter 2007) versus after (first quarter 2010) the worst of the financial crisis. Holdings of stock by households dropped 21.9 percent, private pension funds dropped 32.2 percent, public pension funds fell 19.1 percent, mutual funds fell 18.0, closed-end funds decreased 38.0 percent, and brokers and dealers dropped 50.0 percent. While some of these changes are due to the general decrease in common stock prices, they are also due to investors switching their investments to safer securities during the financial crisis.

As a result of the tremendous increase in stock values in the 1990s, most individuals in the United States either directly own corporate stock or indirectly own stock via investments in mutual funds and pension funds. Figure 8-14 shows the percentage of Americans with investments in the stock market from 1998 through 2019. Ownership peaked at 65 percent in 2007 as stock markets reached record highs. As the stock market plummeted in value during the financial crisis, so did ownership. Although the stock market recovered in 2010-2019, individual investors did not reenter the market, and it fell to a low of 52 percent

Despite an improving economy overall, unemployment remained above 6.0 percent throughout much of this period (not falling below 5.0 percent until January 2016), a level still too high to support wide-ranging stock ownership. As unemployment rate decreased from 2016 through 2019, stock ownership is starting to pick up slightly.

Table 8-5 reports changes in stock ownership since the 2008 financial crisis. Note that in almost every category, percentages have dropped over this period. No decline is observed among upper-income, older Americans.

U.S. stock ownership rates are highly related to income, ranging from 21 percent among those with an annual household income of less than  \$30,000 to 89 percent among those with an income of\$ 100,000 or more. Americans in all income groups below \$100,000 are less likely to own stocks than they were from 2001 to 2008. This includes a drop of 6 percentage points among lower-income households, 13 points among middle-income households (annual income of $30,000 to $74,999), and 10 points among upper-middle-income households (annual income of \$75,000 to 99,999). Given that relatively few Americans in lower-income households invested in stocks before the 2008 financial crisis and upper-income households show no change in ownership, it follows that middle- and upper-middle-income households have largely driven the decline in stock ownership.

Stock ownership also varies by age, perhaps because middle-aged Americans are in their peak earning years. On average, 62 percent of U.S. adults aged 30 to 64 own stocks, compared with 31 percent of those aged 18 to 29 and 54 percent of those aged 65 and older. Older Americans are no less likely now to invest in the stock market than they were from 2001 to 2008, while younger age groups show declines of between 7 and 11 percentage points.

# OTHER ISSUES PERTAINING TO STOCK MARKETS

# Economic Indicators

In Chapter 3 we used time value of money equations to determine the fair value of a stock. Specifically, we saw that the fair value of a stock today  $(P_0)$  could be represented as:

$$

P_{0} = \frac{D_{1}}{\left(1 + r_{s}\right)^{1}} + \frac{D_{2}}{\left(1 + r_{s}\right)^{2}} + \dots + \frac{D_{\infty}}{\left(1 + r_{s}\right)^{\infty}}

$$

The present value of a stock today is the discounted (at a rate  $r_s$ ) sum of the expected future dividends  $(D_t)$  to be paid on the stock. As expected future dividends increase (decrease), stock prices should increase (decrease). Appendix 8A to this chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor) reviews the capital asset pricing model, which is used to determine an appropriate interest rate at which to discount these dividends.

To the extent that today's stock values reflect expected future dividends, stock market indexes might be used to forecast future economic activity. An increase (decrease) in stock market indexes today potentially signals the market's expectation of higher (lower) corporate dividends and profits and, in turn, higher (lower) economic growth. To the extent that the market's assessment of expected dividends is correct, stock market indexes can be predictors of economic activity. Indeed, stock prices are one of the 10 variables included in the index of leading economic indicators used by the Federal Reserve as it formulates economic policy (see Chapter 4).

Figure 8-15 shows the relation between stock market movements (using the DJIA) and economic cycles in the United States. Notice some recessionary periods (represented in by the shaded bars) were indeed preceded by a decline in stock market index values; other recessionary periods were not preceded by a decline in stock market index values. Figure 8-15 suggests that stock market movements are not consistently accurate predictors of economic activity. In fact, of the 14 major stock market predicted recessions since 1942, only 8 actually occurred.

# LG 8-8

# Market Efficiency

# market efficiency

The speed with which financial security prices adjust to unexpected news pertaining to interest rates or a stock-specific characteristic.

As discussed previously (and in Chapter 3), theoretically, the current market price of a stock equals the present value of its expected future dividends (or the fair market or intrinsic value of the security). However, when an event occurs that unexpectedly changes interest rates or a characteristic of the company (e.g., an unexpected dividend increase or decrease in default risk), the current market price of a stock can temporarily diverge from its fair present value. When market traders determine that a stock is undervalued (i.e., the current price of the stock is less than its fair present value), they will purchase the stock, thus driving its price up. Conversely, when market traders determine that a stock is overvalued (i.e., its current price is greater than its fair present value), they will sell the stock, resulting in a price decline.

The degree to which financial security prices adjust to "news" and the degree (and speed) with which stock prices reflect information about the firm and factors that affect firm value is referred to as market efficiency. Three measures (weak form, semistrong form, and strong form market efficiency) are commonly used to measure the degree of stock market efficiency. The measures differ in the type of information or news (e.g., public versus private, historic versus nonhistoric) that is impounded into stock prices.

6. The other indicators include average weekly hours of manufacturing production workers; average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance; manufacturers' new orders, consumer goods and materials; vendor performance, slower diffusion index; manufacturers' new orders, nondefense capital goods; building permits for new private housing units; money supply; interest rate spread, 10-year Treasury bonds less fed funds; and index of consumer expectations. These data, tabulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), are available in the Survey of Current Business.
7. While we discuss market efficiency in the context of stock markets, it also applies to the speed with which any security's price changes in response to new information.

Weak Form Market Efficiency. According to the weak form of market efficiency, current stock prices reflect all historic price and volume information about a company. Old news and trends are already impounded in historic prices and are of no use in predicting today's or future stock prices. Thus, weak form market efficiency concludes that investors cannot make more than the fair (required) return using information based on historic price movements.

Empirical research on weak form market efficiency generally confirms that markets are weak form efficient. Evidence suggests that successive price changes are generally random and that the correlation between stock prices from one day to the next is virtually zero. Thus, historical price and volume trends are of no help in predicting future price movements (and technical analysis has no value as a trading strategy).

Semistrong Form Market Efficiency. The semistrong form market efficiency hypothesis focuses on the speed with which public information is impounded into stock prices. According to the concept of semistrong form market efficiency, as public information arrives about a company, it is immediately impounded into its stock price. For example, semistrong form market efficiency states that a common stock's value should respond immediately to unexpected news announcements by the firm regarding its future earnings. Thus, if an investor calls his or her broker just as the earnings news is released, that investor cannot earn an abnormal return. Prices have already (immediately) adjusted. According to semistrong form market efficiency, investors cannot make more than the fair (required) return by trading on public news releases.

Since historical information is a subset of all public information, if semistrong form market efficiency holds, weak form market efficiency must hold as well. However, it is possible for weak form market efficiency to hold when semistrong form market efficiency does not. This implies that investors can earn abnormal returns by trading on current public news releases. The quicker the stock market impounds this information, the smaller any abnormal returns will be.

Semistrong form market efficiency has been examined by testing how security prices react to unexpected news releases or announcement "events" (see Appendix 8B, Event Study Tests, available through Connect or your course instructor). Some specific announcements that have been tested include macroeconomic events such as interest rate changes and firm-specific announcements such as earnings and dividend changes, stock splits, brokerage house buy and sell recommendations, and mergers and acquisitions. Financial markets have generally been found to immediately reflect information from news announcements.

Strong Form Market Efficiency. The strong form of market efficiency states that stock prices fully reflect all information about the firm, both public and private. Thus, according to strong form market efficiency, even learning private information about the firm is of no help in earning more than the required rate of return. As individuals get private information about a firm, the market has already reacted to it and has fully adjusted the firm's common stock price to its new equilibrium level. Thus, strong form market efficiency implies that there is no set of information that allows investors to make more than the fair (required) rate of return on a stock.

If strong form market efficiency holds, semistrong form market efficiency must hold as well. However, semistrong form market efficiency can hold when strong form market efficiency does not. This implies that private information can be used to produce abnormal returns, but as soon as the private or inside information is publicly released, abnormal returns are unobtainable.

Because private information is not observable, testing for strong form market efficiency is difficult. As a result, there are few studies testing its validity. The limited empirical tests of strong form market efficiency examine information available to insiders. Generally, studies have found that corporate insiders (e.g., directors, officers, and chairs) do earn abnormal returns from trading and that the more informed the insider, the more often abnormal returns are earned. Therefore, information possessed by corporate insiders can be used in trading to earn abnormal returns.

Because private information can be used to earn abnormal returns, laws prohibit investors from trading on the basis of private information (insider trading), although they can trade, like any investor, based on publicly available information about the firm. For

# Pro Golfer Agrees to Repay Trading Profits

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a professional sports gambler who allegedly made 40 million based on illegal stock tips from a corporate insider who owed him money.

The SEC alleges that sports gambler William "Billy" Walters of Las Vegas was owed money by Thomas C. Davis, then-board member of Dean Foods Company. According to the SEC complaint, Davis regularly shared inside information about Dean Foods with Walters in advance of market-moving events using prepaid cell phones and other methods in an effort to avoid detection. The SEC further alleges that while Walters made millions of dollars insider trading using the confidential information, he provided Davis with almost 1 million and other benefits to help Davis address his financial debts.

The SEC complaint also alleges that professional golfer Phil Mickelson traded Dean Foods's securities at Wal- ters's urging and then used his almost 1 million of trading profits to help repay his own gambling debt to Walters. Walters and Davis are charged with insider trading, and Mickelson is named as a relief defendant. Relief defendants are not accused of wrong- doing but are named in SEC complaints for the purposes of recovering alleged ill-gotten gains in their possession from schemes perpetrated by others, said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. "Additionally, Mickelson will repay the money he made from his trading in Dean Foods because he should not be allowed to profit from Walters's illegal conduct."


According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan:
- In July 2012, Walters called Mickelson, who had placed bets with Walters and owed him money at the time. While Walters was in possession of material nonpublic information about Dean Foods, he urged Mickelson to trade in Dean Foods stock.
- Mickelson bought Dean Foods stock the next trading day in three brokerage accounts he controlled. About one week later, Dean Foods's stock price jumped 40 percent following public announcements about the White-Wave spin-off and strong second-quarter earnings.
- Mickelson then sold his shares for more than 931,000 in profits. He repaid his debt to Walters in September 2012 in part with the trading proceeds.

Mickelson neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint and agreed to pay full disgorgement of his trading profits totaling  \$931,738.12 plus interest of\$ 105,291.69.

Galleon Group was one of the largest hedge fund management firms in the world before announcing its closure in October 2009. The firm was at the center of a 2009 insider trading scandal that resulted in investors pulling capital from the firm rapidly. Twenty people, including Rajaratnam, were criminally charged in what federal authorities called the biggest prosecution of alleged hedge fund insider trading in the United States. Prosecutors said they had evidence from wiretaps, trading records, and cooperating witnesses to prove widespread trafficking in illegal insider information, including an insider trading operation that paid sources for nonpublic information that netted the hedge fund more than 20 million. More recently, the In the News box describes how an insider trading scandal landed pro golfer Phil Mickelson in trouble with the SEC.


To try to ensure that insider trading does not occur, publicly traded companies are required to file monthly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting every purchase and sale of the company's securities by officers and directors of the company. Even with this information, identifying trades driven by private (inside) as opposed to public information is often hard.

# Stock Market Regulations

Stock markets and stock market participants are subject to regulations imposed by the SEC as well as the exchanges on which stocks are traded. The main emphasis of SEC regulations is on full and fair disclosure of information on securities issues to actual and potential investors. The two major regulations that were created to prevent unfair and unethical trading practices on security exchanges are the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 1933 act required listed companies to file a registration statement and to issue a prospectus that details the recent financial history of the company when issuing new stock. The 1934 act established the SEC as the main administrative agency responsible for the oversight of secondary stock markets by giving the SEC the authority to monitor the stock market exchanges and administer the provisions of the 1933 act. SEC regulations are not intended to protect investors against poor investment choices but rather to ensure that investors have full and accurate information available when making their investment decisions.

For example, in the early 2000s, a number of securities firms received tremendous publicity concerning conflicts of interest between analysts' research recommendations on buying or not buying stocks and whether the firm played a role in underwriting the securities of the firm the analysts were recommending. After an investigation by the New York State's attorney general, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay a fine of 100 million and to follow procedures more clearly separating analysts' recommendations (and their compensation) from the underwriting activities of the firm. Major Wall Street firms were also investigated. This investigation was triggered by the dramatic collapse of many new technology stocks while analysts were still making recommendations to buy or hold them.

Subsequent to these investigations, the SEC instituted rules requiring Wall Street analysts to vouch that their stock picks have not been influenced by investment banking colleagues and to disclose details of their compensation that would flag investors to any possible conflicts. Evidence that analysts have falsely attested to the independence of their work could be used to institute enforcement actions. Violators could face a wide array of sanctions, including fines and penalties such as a suspension or a bar from the securities industry. In addition, the SEC proposed that top officials from all public companies sign off on financial statements.

Along with these changes instituted by the SEC, the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July 2002. This act created an independent auditing oversight board under the SEC, increased penalties for corporate wrongdoers, forced faster and more extensive financial disclosure, and created avenues of recourse for aggrieved shareholders. Further, in 2002 the NYSE took actions intended to heighten corporate governance standards on domestic NYSE-listed companies. Key changes included requirements on companies to have a majority of independent directors, to adopt corporate governance guidelines and codes of ethics and business conduct, to have shareholders' approval of all equity-based compensation plans, and to have CEOs annually certify information given to investors. The goal of the legislation was to prevent deceptive accounting and management practices and to bring stability to jittery stock markets battered in the summer of 2002 by the corporate governance scandals of Enron, Global Crossings, Tyco, WorldCom, and others.

The SEC came under fire during the financial crisis for its failure to uncover Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The SEC apparently had evidence as early as 1994 (in relation to another case) that Madoff, a former chair of the NASDAQ stock market who was a member of SEC advisory committees, was conducting illegal activities. Further, Harry Markopolos, who worked for a rival company of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, had written to the SEC in May 1999 informing it of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Markopolos examined the options markets that Madoff told investors he used to produce his steady stream of returns and concluded that Madoff's results were impossible. On May 19, 2006, when the SEC questioned Madoff under oath, he falsely described how he would buy and sell stock and options contracts in Europe on behalf of his clients. The SEC asked Madoff: "Is there any documentation generated?" Madoff said yes, but the SEC failed to pursue this further. Eventually, the SEC recommended closing the investigation "because those violations were

not so serious as to warrant an enforcement action." Making things worse for the SEC, Madoff's family had close ties with the SEC. Madoff's sons, brother, and niece worked with or advised the SEC on various matters. Madoff's niece is married to a former SEC attorney who was part of a team that examined Madoff's securities brokerage operation in 1999 and 2004. Neither review resulted in an action against Madoff. In the end, it was not the SEC that discovered Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Because of large redemption claims that his clients filed during the financial crisis, Madoff's Ponzi scheme began to collapse. Madoff admitted to his sons what he had done and they turned him in to authorities.

The SEC's internal watchdog, Inspector General H. David Kotz, stated that he was so concerned about the agency's failure to uncover Madoff's alleged Ponzi scheme that he expanded an inquiry called for by SEC chair Christopher Cox. However, in July 2010, nearly 18 months after Madoff's Ponzi scheme was exposed, lawmakers were still questioning how the SEC staffers who reviewed the Madoff firm and investigated fraud allegations were being punished. SEC chair Mary Schapiro told Congress during an oversight hearing that 15 of 20 enforcement attorneys and 19 of 36 examination staffers that dealt with the Madoff matter had left the agency, but the SEC was still conducting a disciplinary process. Schapiro also said the Madoff incident did change the culture of the SEC. For example, SEC examiners are now verifying custody of assets with third parties, something the SEC failed to do in its review of Madoff and something Madoff later told SEC officials he was sure would have led to his scheme's unraveling.

The SEC has delegated certain regulatory responsibilities to the markets (e.g., NYSE or NASDAQ). In these matters, the NYSE and NASDAQ are self-regulatory organizations. Specifically, the NYSE has primary responsibility for the day-to-day surveillance of trading activity. It monitors specialists to ensure adequate compliance with their obligation to make a fair and orderly market; monitors all trading to guard against unfair trading practices; monitors broker-dealer activity with respect to minimum net capital requirements, standards, and licensing; and enforces various listing and disclosure requirements. For example, in October 2007 NYSE regulators censured and fined several NYSE member firms for failure to deliver prospectuses to a large number of customers.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is the largest independent regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States. FINRA was formed in July 2007 as a result of the merger of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) with the enforcement arm of the New York Stock Exchange. FINRA oversees all aspects of the securities business, including registering and educating industry participants, examining securities firms, writing rules, enforcing those rules and the federal securities laws, informing and educating the investing public, providing trade reporting and other industry reports, and administering the largest dispute resolution forum for investors and registered firms.

As mentioned earlier, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (passed in response to the financial crisis) gave the SEC and other regulators new powers to oversee the operations of stock markets. These rules empower the SEC to disseminate a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers that provide personalized investment services, to require disclosures on broker-dealers that sell only proprietary products, to review rule changes of self-regulatory organizations that affect custody of customer securities or funds, and to facilitate the provision of simple and clear investor disclosures regarding the terms of relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisors. The new rules also require the SEC to undertake a study on conflicts of interest involving analysts.

Six years after the passage of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 271 rule-making deadlines have passed. Of these, 204 (75.3 percent) have been met with finalized rules and rules have been proposed that would meet 34 (12.5 percent) more. Rules have not yet been proposed to meet 33 (12.2 percent) passed rule-making requirements. Of the 390 total rule-making requirements, 267 (68.5 percent) have been met with finalized rules and rules have been proposed that would meet 40 (10.2 percent) more. Rules have not yet been proposed to meet 83 (21.3 percent) rule-making requirements. The enormity of the act has consumed a vast amount of the SEC's resources and left many pressing issues affecting investor confidence unaddressed.

# INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF STOCK MARKETS

LG 8-9

The U.S. stock markets are the world's largest. However, with the full implementation of a common currency—the euro—in 2002, European markets grew in importance during the 2000s. Further, economic growth in Asia-Pacific countries, and other emerging market countries has resulted in significant growth in their stock markets. Figure 8-16 shows the proportion of stock market capitalization among various countries in 1990, 2000, 2009, and 2018. The U.S. dominance in the stock markets is best seen in 2000. However, U.S. market capitalization decreased in size in 2009.

Factors behind the U.S. dominance in world stock markets changed in the mid-2000s. Strict new U.S. regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (discussed earlier) increased the cost of operating in the United States and resulted in a significant drop in IPOs of foreign firms in the United States. Further, U.S. economic growth slowed from an annual rate of over 4 percent in the first two quarters of 2006 to  $1 \frac{1}{4}$  percent in the first quarter of 2007. A sharp downturn in the U.S. subprime housing market was a major factor for the slow U.S. growth. During this period growth strengthened in most other major countries, including the euro area, China, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Indeed, in early 2007 growth in the euro area exceeded that in the United States for the first time since 2002. Further, China's economy continued to expand.

Note also the stock market developments in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the emerging market countries from 1990 to 2018. European markets increased their market share (from 21.1 percent in 1990 to 30.5 percent of the total in 2000). However, as the U.S. financial crisis spread and Europe then fell into a deep sovereign debt crisis in the late 2010s, European markets fell to just 23.1 percent of the world total in 2009. Issues got worse in Europe in 2016 as the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, sending the British and European markets down further, to 18.5 percent by December 2018. The Asian economic problems that started in 1997 reduced the value of these markets significantly (e.g., Asia-Pacific and emerging markets stock markets decreased from 4.6 percent and 2.4 percent in 1990 to 4.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2000 of the worldwide stock markets, respectively). However, these regions were less affected by the financial crisis that hit the United States and Europe. Thus, they recovered and grew to 15.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, in 2009. By December 2018, Asia-Pacific stock markets increased even further to become 25.1 percent of the worldwide stock markets, driven by growth in Chinese stock markets.

From an investor's viewpoint, international stock markets are attractive because some risk can be eliminated (diversified away—see Chapter 21) by holding stocks issued by corporations in foreign countries. For example, while a stock issued by a corporation in one country might be reduced in value by a recessionary slowdown, increases in the value of stocks issued by a corporation in another country (that is experiencing economic growth or an appreciation in the foreign exchange rate of its currency) can offset those losses. Figure 8-17 shows the movements of major world stock markets from 2000 through 2019. While these markets generally move together, the correlation in the movements is not perfect. The Bank for International Settlements reported that correlations in stock returns between U.S. and a combination of euro area was as high as 0.93 from 2003 to 2005 and decreased to 0.63 by 2007. From 2009 to 2019, the correlation between U.S. and euro area stock markets were again back to 0.92 (see Figure 8-17).

# EXAMPLE 8-6 Returns from Investing in an International Portfolio of Stocks

Suppose you owned stock in a U.S. company and a UK company. U.S. dollars were converted to British pounds last year to make the investment, and pounds were converted back to dollars as you liquidated the investment. Also suppose the exchange rate of British pounds into U.S. dollars was 1.8081 last year and is now 1.8909. Thus, the pound appreciated relative to the dollar over the investment period. The details of the two stock investments are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>U.S. Stock</td><td>UK Stock</td><td></td><td>U.S. Dollar Equivalent for UK Stocks</td></tr><tr><td>Purchase price, P_{t-1}^{C}</td><td>$50</td><td>£60</td><td>=</td><td>$108.486</td></tr><tr><td>Sale price, P_{t}^{C}</td><td>$48</td><td>£64</td><td>=</td><td>$121.0176</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends, D_{t}^{C}</td><td>$1.50</td><td>£2.50</td><td>=</td><td>$ 4.72725</td></tr></table>

The return on the U.S. company's stock was:

$$

R_{t}^{U S} = \frac{\mathbb {S} 48 - \mathbb {S} 50}{\mathbb {S} 50} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 1.5}{\mathbb {S} 50} = - 1 \%

$$ and the return on the UK company's stock, ignoring the change in the exchange rate, was:


$$

R_{t}^{U K} = \frac{\text{£} 64 - \text{£} 60}{\text{£} 60} + \frac{\text{£} 2.5}{\text{£} 60} = 10.83 \%

$$

On a U.S. dollar equivalent basis the return was:

$$

R_{t}^{U K} = \frac{\mathbb {S} 121.0176 - \mathbb {S} 108.486}{\mathbb {S} 108.486} + \frac{\mathbb {S} 4.72725}{108.486} = 15.91 \%

$$

The loss on the U.S. stock, 1 percent, was offset by an increase in the value of the UK stock, reflecting both an increase in its local market value and an appreciation in the pound relative to the dollar.

While international diversification eliminates some risks, it introduces others. For example, for smaller investors, information about foreign stocks is less complete and timely than that for U.S. stocks. Further, international investments introduce foreign exchange risk (see Chapter 9) and political (or sovereign) risk (see Chapter 20). Table 8-7 shows the return on various world stock markets in U.S. dollars and in the local currency for the year December 2018–December 2019. Note the impact that foreign exchange rate changes have on these returns. For example, the return on the Argentina Merval index was  $-13.3$  percent when measured in U.S. dollars and  $37.6$  percent when measured using the Argentine peso.

As seen in Table 8-4 (Rest of the World), in 2019 foreign investors held  \$7.6 trillion (or 15.9 percent) of the outstanding stock in the United States. Moreover, trading of foreign companies on U.S. stock exchanges totaled\$ 3.1 trillion.

Facilitating U.S. investment in stocks of foreign corporations is the creation of the American Depositary Receipt (ADR). An ADR is a certificate that represents ownership of a foreign stock. An ADR is typically created by a U.S. bank, which buys stock in foreign corporations in their domestic currencies and places them with a custodian. The bank then issues dollar ADRs backed by the shares of the foreign stock. Each ADR is a claim on a given number of shares of stock held by the bank. These ADRs are then traded in the United States, in dollars, on and off the organized exchanges. Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) are similar to ADRs, but are issued worldwide.

There are currently close to 1,000 ADRs of foreign corporations (such as Novartis AG and Petrobras) available to U.S. investors (mainly listed on the NYSE or the NASDAQ). There are three main types of ADR issuances: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

Level 1 ADRs are the most common and most basic of the ADRs. Level 1 ADRs are traded only on the over-the-counter (OTC) market and have the least amount of regulatory requirements as stipulated by the SEC. The companies issuing these ADRs do not have to abide by U.S. accounting (GAAP) standards, nor do they have to issue annual reports. Companies with shares trading under a Level 1 program may decide to upgrade their program to a Level 2 or Level 3 program to gain better exposure in U.S. markets.

Level 2 ADRs can be listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE and NASDAQ), but they have more regulatory requirements than Level 1 ADRs. Issuers of Level 2 ADRs are required to register with the SEC, to file a form 20-F (the basic equivalent to the regular 10-K filing by companies in the United States), and to file an annual report that complies with GAAP standards. Due to their listing on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets, Level 2 ADRs have much higher trading volumes than Level 1 ADRs. While listed on these exchanges, the company must meet their listing requirements. If it fails to do so, it may be delisted and forced to downgrade its ADR program.

Level 3 ADRs represent the most respected ADR level a foreign company can achieve in the United States markets. Like Level 2 ADRs, companies that issue Level 3 ADRs are required to register with the SEC, to file a form 20-F, and to file annual reports that comply with GAAP standards. Level 3 ADR companies, however, are allowed to issue shares directly into the U.S. markets, rather than simply allowing the indirect purchase of already created shares. Thus, the foreign company can actually issue shares in U.S. markets to raise capital. A foreign company with a Level 3 program is required to share any news that it distributes within its home country with U.S. investors. Thus, foreign companies with Level 3 programs are the easiest on which to find information.

Most ADR programs are subject to possible termination, which results in the cancellation of all the depository receipts, and a subsequent delisting from all exchanges on which they trade. The termination can be at the discretion of the foreign issuer or the depository bank, but is typically at the request of the issuer. In most cases, some type of reorganization or merger is the reason for termination of an ADR program.

The major attraction to U.S. investors is that ADRs are claims to foreign companies that trade on domestic (U.S.) exchanges and in dollars. Further, fees on ADRs are lower than those on many international mutual funds. Additionally, as mentioned above, investments in foreign securities help diversify a stock portfolio. However, like all international investments there are unique risks that are associated with them that are not usually present with domestic securities. For example, investors must consider country risk, foreign exchange risk, and other attributes when evaluating ADRs. Further, international companies and their underlying countries are not subject to as strict financial reporting standards as are companies in the United States. Thus, investors may experience trouble understanding financial reports, terms, and definitions due to differing accounting standards as well as language barriers.

As noted earlier, U.S. stock exchanges are regulated by the SEC on some matters and are self-regulated organizations for others. Stock market structures in Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia are similar to the U.S. structure. These exchanges are self-regulating, with the government mainly playing the role of monitor. In Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia, the exchanges determine which securities are listed and the criteria that firms must meet for membership. In Japan, the Ministry of Finance must approve all listed securities. In France, Belgium, Spain, and Italy, governments exercise the major control over the operations and activities of the exchanges. Membership on these exchanges may require government approval or licensing, and to insure against insolvency government agencies set minimum capital requirements. In Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, the majority of the exchange trading is conducted through banks, reflecting regulatory and government policy.

Similar to the United States, stock markets in Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, and most of Europe use continuous trading. Stock markets in Germany and Austria use call-based trading, in which orders are batched for simultaneous execution at the same price and at a particular time during the day. Only the Montreal Stock Exchange uses a DMM system of trading directly similar to that of the NYSE. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange gives certain firms the DMMs' duties for small and medium-sized trades. Large trades, however, are transacted directly by the parties involved. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, market makers are similar to specialists. These traders are selected by the exchange to trade for their own accounts and to create an orderly price flow in stocks that the exchange assigns them. These traders are obligated to post bid and ask prices throughout the day and to keep their bid-ask spreads small.

All other continuous trading markets in the world use a competitive dealer system of trading similar to that used by NASDAQ. For example, the London International Stock Exchange allows any well-capitalized firm that follows the regulations to act as a dealer for any security. Market makers publish firm bid-ask quotes for their stocks. One difference in this market is that for a limit order, only the broker-dealer that accepts the order

from a customer knows about it. The computerized trading system does not record the existence of an order. The dealer then executes the order when his or her own price reaches the requested level. The Tokyo Stock Exchange uses a variation of the competitive dealer system, in which a broker functions as an intermediary between the dealers and the brokers who are members of the exchange. The brokers cannot buy or sell for their own accounts, but can only arrange transactions among dealers, conduct trading auctions, and match buy and sell orders submitted by brokers for their clients.

# SUMMARY

In this chapter, we examined corporate stocks and stock markets. Holders of corporate (preferred and common) stock have an ownership interest in the issuing firm based on the percentage of stock held. Stock markets are the most watched and reported of the financial markets. We described the major characteristics of corporate stocks—for example, dividend rights, residual claim status, limited liability, and voting rights of stockholders. We also looked at the primary and secondary markets for stocks, including a description of the trading process. While the NYSE has historically been the major stock market exchange in the United States, we showed that the NASDAQ system is increasing in importance. We also looked at stock market indexes as predictors of future economic activity, reviewed the speed with which stock market prices adjust to new information, and described the major regulations governing stock market trading. We concluded the chapter with a brief look at international stock market activity—foreign investments in U.S. corporate stocks and U.S. investments in foreign corporate stocks.
