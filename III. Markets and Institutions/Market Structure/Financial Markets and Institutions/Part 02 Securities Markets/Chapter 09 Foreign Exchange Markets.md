# FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS AND RISK: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

LG 9-1 Cash flows from the sale of products, services, or assets denominated in a foreign currency are transacted in foreign exchange (FX) markets. A foreign exchange rate is the price at which one currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar) can be exchanged for another currency (e.g., the Swiss franc) in the foreign exchange markets. These transactions expose U.S. corporations and investors to foreign exchange risk as the cash flows are converted into and out of U.S. dollars. Thus, in addition to understanding the operations of domestic financial markets, financial managers and investors must also understand the operations of foreign exchange markets and foreign capital markets.

Today's U.S.-based companies operate globally. It is therefore essential that financial managers understand how events and movements in financial markets in other countries affect the profitability and performance of their own companies. For example, in 2019 McDonald's net income was up 1.7 percent from 2018. However, excluding losses from foreign exchange movements, net income would have increased 5.1 percent. In 2019, more than 63 percent of McDonald's revenue came from outside the United States. Most growth going forward was expected to come from business expansion overseas rather than from within the United States. Foreign currency exchange is therefore an important factor for investors

to consider. More broadly, extreme foreign exchange risk from a single event was evident in 2015 when banks, brokers, and individual investors lost hundreds of millions of dollars after an unexpected surge in the Swiss franc shook foreign exchange markets. The Swiss franc jumped by nearly 30 percent against the euro and 18 percent against the dollar in the minutes following the Swiss National Bank's decision to stop capping the value of the franc against the euro. Citigroup and Deutsche Bank each lost about  \$150 million on the franc's appreciation. Barclays expected losses to be in the tens of millions of dollars. FXCM Inc., a major U.S. retail foreign exchange broker, saw the biggest losses and had to be rescued with emergency funding of\$ 300 million from investment firm Leucadia National Corp.

An even larger event was United Kingdom's 2016 vote to leave the European Union (called Brexit), which shocked the global economy in an unusual way. In the aftermath of the June 23 vote, the value of the British pound plummeted over 12 percent against the dollar and 10 percent against the euro, over the course of two weeks. The U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen surged. Unlike normal times, when at least one of those moves would signal faster growth to come, all three countries braced for foreign exchange risk-driven slowdowns in their economies. The United States and Japan worried that the strength of their currencies would hurt exports of their goods and services. The United Kingdom suddenly found itself in a similar situation to many developing nations, less concerned with how a weaker currency might boost its export sectors and more with the faltering economic prospects that caused investors to flee the pound.

In 2019, U.S. imports of foreign goods were  \$2.5 trillion, while exports totaled\$ 1.7 trillion. Trades of this magnitude would not be possible without a market where investors can easily buy and sell foreign currencies. Additionally, as firms and investors increase the volume of transactions in foreign currencies, hedging foreign exchange risk has become a more important activity. Financial managers therefore must understand how events in other countries in which they operate affect cash flows received from or paid to other countries and thus their company's profitability. Foreign exchange markets are the markets in which traders of foreign currencies transact most efficiently and at the lowest cost. As a result, foreign exchange markets facilitate foreign trade, the raising of capital in foreign markets, the transfer of risk between participants, and speculation on currency values.

The actual amount of U.S. dollars received on a foreign transaction depends on the (foreign) exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency when the nondollar cash flow is received (and exchanged for U.S. dollars) at some future date. If the foreign currency declines (or depreciates) in value relative to the U.S. dollar over the period between the time a foreign investment is made and the time it is liquidated, the dollar value of the cash flows received will fall. If the foreign currency rises (or appreciates) in value relative to the U.S. dollar, the dollar value of the cash flows received on the foreign investment increases.

In this chapter, we examine the operations of foreign exchange markets. We start with a brief look at the history of foreign exchange markets. We define and describe the spot and forward foreign exchange transaction process. We also look at how changes in a country's inflation and short-term interest rates affect the exchange rate of the country's currency. Transactions between citizens of one country (e.g., the United States) with other countries are summarized in the balance of payment accounts of that country. Balance of payment (international transactions) accounts for the United States are presented and described in Appendix 9A (available through Connect or your course instructor).

# BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

LG 9-2

Foreign exchange markets have existed for some time as international trade and investing have resulted in the need to exchange currencies. The type of exchange rate system used to accomplish this exchange, however, has changed over time. During most of the 1800s, foreign exchange markets operated under a gold standard or system. Under the gold standard, currency issuers guaranteed to redeem notes, upon demand, in an equivalent amount of gold. Governments that employed such a fixed system of exchange, and which redeemed their notes to other governments in gold, shared a fixed-currency relationship. As a result, gold became a transportable, universal, and stable unit of valuation. Further, the United Kingdom, which at the time was the dominant international trading country, had a long-standing commitment to the gold standard. However, during the 1939-1942 period, the United Kingdom depleted much of its gold stock in purchases of munitions and weaponry from the United States and other nations to fight the Second World War. This depletion of the United Kingdom's reserve signaled to Winston Churchill (the UK prime minister at the time) that returning to a prewar-style gold standard was impractical. As a result, from 1944 to 1971 the Bretton Woods Agreement called for the exchange rate of one currency for another to be fixed within narrow bands around a specified rate with the help of government intervention. The Bretton Woods Agreement, however, led to a situation in which some currencies (such as the U.S. dollar) became overvalued and others (such as the German mark) became undervalued. The Smithsonian Agreement of 1971 sought to address this situation. Under this agreement, major countries allowed the dollar to be devalued and the boundaries between which exchange rates could fluctuate were increased from 1 percent to  $2\frac{1}{4}$  percent.

In 1973, under the Smithsonian Agreement II, the exchange rate boundaries were eliminated altogether. This effectively allowed exchange rates of major currencies to float freely. This free-floating foreign exchange rate system is still partially in place. However, as discussed in Chapter 4 and below, central governments may still intervene in the foreign exchange markets directly to change the direction of exchange rate and currency movements by altering interest rates to affect the value of their currency relative to others. In 1992, 12 major European countries and Vatican City pegged their exchange rates together to create a single currency, called the euro.[2]

Until 1972, the interbank foreign exchange market was the only channel through which spot and forward (see below) foreign exchange transactions took place. The interbank market involves electronic trades between major banks (such as between JPMorgan Chase and HSBC) around the world. This market is over the counter (OTC) and thus has no regular trading hours, so that currencies can be bought or sold somewhere around the world 24 hours a day. Since 1972, organized markets such as the International Money Market (IMM) of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have developed derivatives trading in foreign currency futures and options. However, the presence of such a well-developed interbank market for foreign exchange forward contracts has hampered the development of the futures market for foreign exchange trading. For example, while foreign currency trading has grown significantly since 1972, trading in the forward market continues to be much larger than the futures market (on the order of 20 times the daily volume measured by value of trades).

The major differences between the interbank foreign exchange market and organized trading on exchanges include market location, standardization of contracts, standardization of delivery dates, and differences in the way contracts are settled. While the interbank forward market is a worldwide market with no geographic boundaries, the principal futures market is the IMM in Chicago. Futures market contracts trade in the major currencies (e.g., the euro, British pound) with contracts expiring on the third Wednesday of March, June, September, and December. In contrast, forward market contracts can be entered into on any currency, with maturity stated as a given number of days for delivery of the currency in the future. The futures market (the IMM of the CME) determines the size of futures contracts on foreign currencies, and all contracts must be of these sizes. In the forward market, contract size is negotiated between the bank and the customer. Finally, less than 1 percent of all futures contracts are completed by delivery of the foreign currency. Rather, profit or loss on the futures contract is settled daily between the trader and the exchange, and many traders

The foreign exchange markets have become among the largest of all financial markets, with turnover exceeding  \$8.3 trillion per day in 2019. Figure 9-1 shows the percentage share of the major foreign exchange trading centers worldwide from 1995 through 2019. London continues to be the largest center for trading in foreign exchange (43.1 percent of worldwide trading); it handles over twice the daily volume of New York, the second-largest market (16.5 percent of all trading). Despite the drawn-out Brexit process, London continues to be the dominant location for foreign exchange trading, with turnover exceeding\$ 3.5 trillion per day in 2019. Third-ranked Singapore handles approximately one-sixth the volume of London. Moreover, the FX market is essentially a 24-hour market, moving from Tokyo, London, and New York throughout the day. Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates and thus FX trading risk exposure continues into the night even when some FI operations are closed.

LG9-2

The Introduction of the Euro. The euro is the name of the European Union's single currency. It started trading on January 1, 1999, when exchange rates among the currencies of the original 12 participating countries were fixed, although domestic currencies (e.g., the Italian lira and French franc) continued to circulate. By January 1, 2002, domestic currencies started to be phased out and euro notes and coins began circulating within 12 EU countries (increased to 19 EU countries and 5 non-EU countries by 2019) and Vatican City. The eventual creation of the euro had its origins in the creation of the European Community (EC): a consolidation of three European communities in 1967 (the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Market, and the European Atomic Energy Community). The emphasis of the EC was both political and economic. Its aim was to break down trade barriers within a common market and create a political union among the people of Europe. The Maastricht Treaty of 1993 set out stages for transition to an integrated monetary union among the EC participating countries, referred to as the European Monetary Union (EMU). Some of the main stipulations of the Maastricht Treaty included the eventual creation of a single currency (the euro), the creation of an integrated European system of central banks, and the establishment of a single European Central Bank (ECB).

While the creation of the euro has had a significant effect throughout Europe, it has also had a notable impact on the global financial system. For example, in the first decade of the 2000s, as the United States experienced an increasing national debt, rapid consumer spending, and a current account deficit big enough to bankrupt most other countries

# dollarization

The use of a foreign currency in parallel to, or instead of, the local currency.

(see below), the euro increased in value by 35 percent against the U.S. dollar. Indeed, in the mid-2000s, as the dollar depreciated in value against the euro, Russia's Central Bank said it was considering replacing some of the U.S. dollars in its reserves with euros. Asian central banks hinted that they would soon do the same. The Chinese Central Bank had already substituted some of its dollars for euros. As a result of these actions, the euro was the world's second most important currency for international transactions behind the dollar and some predicted, given the combined size of the "euro-economies," that it would compete against the dollar as the premier international currency. However, in the 2010s, while the U.S. debt problems continued, Europe was in a full-blown sovereign debt crisis. The dollar strengthened against the euro as Europe's debt crisis continued to persist. Central banks turned back to the dollar over the euro. The dollar remains the unparalleled medium of exchange because it is the world's easiest currency to buy or sell. In 2019, 88 percent of all foreign exchange transactions were denominated in dollars, while 32 percent were denominated in euros. Because two currencies are involved in each transaction, the sum of the percentage shares of individual currencies totals 200 percent instead of 100 percent.

Dollarization. Following the abandonment of the gold standard and the Bretton Woods Agreement, some countries sought ways to promote global economic stability and hence their own prosperity. For many of these countries, currency stabilization was achieved by pegging the local currency to a major convertible currency. Other countries simply abandoned their local currency in favor of exclusive use of the U.S. dollar (or another major international currency, such as the euro). The use of a foreign currency in parallel to, or instead of, the local currency is referred to as *dollarization.* Dollarization can occur unofficially (when private agents prefer the foreign currency over the domestic currency) or officially (when a country adopts the foreign currency as legal tender and ceases to issue the domestic currency). For example, if the U.S. dollar is the currency adopted, Federal Reserve notes become legal tender and the only form of paper money recognized by the government. There is nothing to prevent a country from unilaterally moving to an official dollarized currency. However, if the U.S. dollar is to be used as another country's official currency, the Fed has recommended that it receive advance notification of the extra notes that it would have to make available.

The major advantage of dollarization is the promotion of fiscal discipline and thus greater financial stability and lower inflation. The biggest economies to have officially dollarized are Panama (since 1904), Ecuador (since 2000), and El Salvador (since 2001). The U.S. dollar, the euro, the New Zealand dollar, the Swiss franc, the Indian rupee, and the Australian dollar are the only currencies used by other countries for official dollarization. Dollarization was highly unsuccessful at helping Argentina address its financial crisis in the early 2000s and was abandoned. Prior to its economic crisis from 1999 to 2002, Argentina operated under a currency board system that maintained a 1:1 exchange rate between the dollar and the peso. Dollarization required holding sufficient dollar reserves to fully back the pesos in circulation. With the appreciation of the dollar in the late 1990s, the Argentine currency board experienced overvaluation. Argentina's exports became less competitive on the world market. In addition, Argentina had been running massive fiscal budget deficits for some years. The climbing deficit led to an increase in devaluation concerns. As a result, roughly 20 billion in capital fled the country in 2001. Peso interest rates climbed to between 40 and 60 percent, which further weakened the government's budget position. At the end of 2001, Argentina abandoned the peg to the dollar and went to a floating exchange rate for the peso.

The Free-Floating Yuan. On July 21, 2005, the Chinese government shifted away from its currency's (the yuan) peg to the U.S. dollar, stating that the value of the yuan would be determined using a "managed" floating system with reference to an unspecified basket of foreign currencies. The partial free-floating of the yuan was in part the result of pressure from Western countries whose politicians argued that China's currency regime gave it an unfair advantage in global markets due to the relative underpricing of the yuan with respect to the dollar and other currencies. The undervalued yuan resulted in Chinese exports being relatively cheap, which hurt domestic manufacturing in other countries, especially the United States. Indeed, lawmakers in the U.S. Congress, worried about the loss of U.S. jobs, threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese goods unless China changed its foreign exchange policy. Finance ministers from the world's leading economies unanimously argued that China should let the yuan float.

Using statistical methods that take into account concurrent movements in exchange rates among the reference currencies, economists inferred that the yuan eventually became equally weighted between the dollar and the euro after Beijing de-pegged from the dollar. The yuan's 20 percent appreciation against the dollar between 2005 and 2008 mostly reflected the euro's gains against the dollar. By May 2008, as the global financial crisis unfolded and the dollar began to rebound against the euro, Beijing started to move the yuan back toward giving primary weighting to the dollar. This move kept the yuan from falling against the dollar during the global financial meltdown. Thus, China's currency policy had come full circle, virtually back to what it was in late 2005.

Throughout the financial crisis U.S. officials worried that, by keeping its currency artificially weak and thus its goods more competitive on world markets, China's failure to let the yuan float freely would slow down the U.S. and worldwide recovery from the financial crisis and the recession of 2008-2009. Beijing promised a more flexible exchange rate in June 2010, effectively ditching a two-year peg to the dollar that was enacted during the global financial crisis. But the yuan rose by only about 2 percent against the dollar in the following three months. Its appreciation sped up slightly after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in September 2010 that would allow Washington to sanction countries that manipulate their currency for trade gain. Further, in October 2010, the then U.S. Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner held talks with top Chinese finance officials amid currency tensions after a pledge by finance leaders worldwide to rebalance the global economy. Additionally, in November 2010, G-20 finance ministers and central bankers promised to avoid debilitating currency devaluations, to reduce trade and financial imbalances, and to give China and other major developing countries a bigger role in managing the global economy. However, actions by the United States had little effect (particularly as the United States was accused of its own currency manipulation from 2010 through 2013 as it purchased billions in U.S. Treasury securities in its efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy) and the yuan remained weak through the end of the decade.

In the 2010s, aware of the criticisms pertaining to currency manipulation and repercussions to its economic growth, China began to respond, albeit slowly. In 2009, it began a pilot program of internationalizing its currency by allowing Hong Kong banks to trade the yuan. As a result, the number of yuan-held deposits in Hong Kong exploded, from less than 100 billion yuan in 2010 to about 600 billion yuan in 2013. In January 2011, China began allowing Americans to trade in the currency and Chinese-based companies were allowed for the first time to use the yuan for business outside the mainland. By October 2011, foreign companies were allowed to settle direct investments on the mainland using the yuan. Then in 2012, China eased the yuan's trading band against the dollar for the first time in five years—allowing the currency to fluctuate more broadly. The rapid growth in off-the-mainland yuan deposits was recognized by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In February 2013 the CME announced it would join Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and start trading Chinese Renmimbi (CNH) futures under contracts of up to three years.

In November 2015, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) designated the Chinese yuan (also called renminbi or RMB), an IMF-accepted reserve currency, along with the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, and euro in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) basket (effective on October 1, 2016). The SDR is neither a currency nor a claim on the IMF.

It was created by the 188-country organization that works to foster global monetary cooperation in 1969 to support the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. It is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of its members, and SDRs can be exchanged for freely usable currencies. For China, SDR inclusion is mostly a symbolic event. It would be the first emerging market currency added to the SDR and the first new currency added since the SDR's creation. With the inclusion, China begins to enjoy the privilege of issuing a currency that is viewed not just as an invoice currency, but as a true reserve currency by its foreign partners.

As of the third quarter of 2019, total foreign exchange reserves of 149 countries stood at 10.9 trillion, according to the IMF. The U.S. dollar made up 61.2 percent of all known foreign exchange reserves. The euro was 20.0 percent; Japanese yen, 5.6 percent; British pound sterling, 4.4 percent; and Chinese yuan, 2.0 percent.

# Foreign Exchange Rates

As mentioned earlier, a foreign exchange rate is the price at which one currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar) can be exchanged for another currency (e.g., the Swiss franc). Table 9-1 lists the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies as of 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time on March 13, 2020. Foreign exchange rates are listed in two ways: U.S. dollars received for one unit of the foreign currency exchanged (IN US$ or USD, also referred to as the direct quote) and foreign currency received for each U.S. dollar exchanged (PER US$, also referred to as the indirect quote). For example, the exchange rate of U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars (CAD) on March 13, 2020, was $0.7243 (US$/C$ or CAD/USD), or U.S. \$0.7243 could be received for each Canadian dollar exchanged. Conversely, the exchange rate of Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars was 1.3807 (C$/US$ or USD/CAD), or 1.3807 Canadian dollars could be received for each U.S. dollar exchanged.

Notice that the "IN US$" exchange rates, or the rate of U.S. dollars for the foreign currency, are simply the inverse of the "PER US$" exchange rates, or the rate of exchange of foreign currency for U.S. dollars and vice versa. For example, US$/C$ = $0.7243 = 1/(C$/US$) = 1/1.3807, and C$/US$ = 1.3807 = 1/(US$/C$) = 1/\$0.7243. This is the case for both spot and forward exchange rates in Table 9-1.

# LG 9-4

# spot foreign exchange transactions

Foreign exchange transactions involving the immediate exchange of currencies at the current (or spot) exchange rate.

# Foreign Exchange Transactions

There are two types of foreign exchange rates and foreign exchange transactions: spot and forward. Spot foreign exchange transactions involve the immediate exchange of currencies at the current (or spot) exchange rate—see Figure 9-2. Spot transactions can be conducted through the foreign exchange division of commercial banks or a nonbank foreign currency dealer. For example, a U.S. investor wanting to buy British pounds through a local bank on March 13, 2020, essentially has the dollars transferred from his or her bank account to the dollar account of a pound seller at a rate of  \$1 per 0.8141 pound (or\$ 1.2284 per pound). Simultaneously, pounds are transferred from the seller's account into an account designated by the U.S. investor. If the dollar depreciates in value relative to the pound (e.g.,  \$1 per 0.8135 pound or\$ 1.2293 per pound), the value of the pound investment, if converted back into U.S. dollars, increases. If the dollar appreciates in value relative to the pound (e.g., \$1 per 0.8152 pound or \$1.2267 per pound), the value of the pound investment, if converted back into U.S. dollars, decreases.

The exchange rates listed in Table 9-1 all involve the exchange of U.S. dollars for the foreign currency, or vice versa. Historically, the exchange of a sum of money into a different currency required a trader to first convert the money into U.S. dollars and then convert it into the desired currency. More recently, cross-currency trades allow currency traders to

5. USD is the currency code for the U.S. dollar set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations. The ISO 4217 standard specifies the structure for a three-letter alphabetic code for the representation of currencies. The designations for the major currencies are: U.S. dollar (USD), euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), British pound (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), Canadian dollar (CAD), Swiss franc (CHF), and Hong Kong dollar (HKD). 6. In actual practice, settlement—exchange of currencies—occurs normally two days after a transaction.

Cross-currency trades are a pair of currencies traded in foreign exchange markets that do not involve the U.S. dollar. For example, GBP/JPY cross-exchange trading was created to allow individuals in the UK and Japan who wanted to convert their money into the other currency to do so without having to bear the cost of having to first convert into U.S. dollars. Cross-currency exchange rates for nine major countries are listed at Bloomberg's website www.bloomberg.com/markets/ currencies/fxc.html.

Figure 9-2 Spot versus Forward Foreign Exchange Transaction

The appreciation of a country's currency (or a rise in its value relative to other currencies) means that the country's goods are more expensive for foreign buyers and foreign goods are cheaper for foreign sellers (all else constant). Thus, when a country's currency appreciates, domestic manufacturers find it harder to sell their goods abroad and foreign manufacturers find it easier to sell their goods to domestic purchasers. Conversely, depreciation of a country's currency (or a fall in its value relative to other currencies) means the country's goods become cheaper for foreign buyers and foreign goods become more expensive for foreign sellers.

Figure 9-3 shows the pattern of spot exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and several foreign currencies from 2002 through 2019. As the figure shows, the U.S. dollar depreciated relative to the euro and a number of other floating currencies between 2003 and 2007. In October 2007, the dollar hit a record low against the euro, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar, and it fell to a three-month low against the British pound. A main factor affecting exchange rate movements was interest rate differentials across major economies. The euro's rise in value against the U.S. dollar was due, at least in part, to the fact that the euro area had the highest interest rates and thus attracted yield-driven investment capital. In the summer of 2007, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates to boost a weakening economy that was particularly hard hit as a result of a crumbling subprime mortgage market and a record slowdown in the overall housing market. Relatively high interest rates in the United Kingdom contributed to the appreciation of the pound against the dollar (and the yen) as well. A second factor affecting the exchange rates was a high volume of central bank intervention relative to past practice, especially in Asian countries. These actions kept upward pressure on the local currencies but helped devalue the U.S. dollar. For example, the Japanese Ministry of Finance purchased  \$316 billion of U.S. assets between January 2003 and March 2004 (many times the purchases in earlier years). Chinese monetary authorities bought dollar reserves while trying to preserve the yuan's fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. In India, Korea, and Taiwan, dollar reserves also rose substantially as monetary authorities tried to limit the appreciation of their currencies against the U.S. dollar. Official foreign exchange reserves held by monetary authorities worldwide increased another\$ 850 billion in 2006 (twice the amount held in 2005). China had the largest accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, despite moving to a more flexible exchange rate regime in 2005. Russia had the second-largest increase, followed by Brazil and India. By 2007 there was talk of a possible dollar crisis.

The financial crisis, however, brought a halt to such discussions. As can be seen in Figure 9-3, during the crisis, the dollar appreciated sharply against most foreign currencies. Notice the significant swings in the exchange rates of most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during the financial crisis. Between September 2008 and mid-2010, exchange rates have gone through three trends. During the first phase, from September 2008 to March 2009, the U.S. dollar appreciated relative to most foreign currencies (or, foreign currencies depreciated relative to the dollar) as investors sought a safe haven in U.S. Treasury securities. Such a sharp appreciation of the dollar had not been seen since 1973, when the generalized floating of currency exchange rates began. Many explanations have been given for the sharp appreciation of the dollar during the financial crisis. One explanation is that U.S. and foreign investors led a flight to quality, selling corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities and investing in U.S. Treasury securities. Seen as a safe haven, U.S. Treasuries gained in value as equities plunged and credit spreads widened to record levels. This demand for U.S. Treasuries resulted in a dollar shortage and resulted in high dollar interest rates that supported the U.S. dollar. Following the crisis, however, the dollar depreciated in value almost as quickly as it had appreciated in value during the crisis.

During the second phase, from March 2009 through November 2009, much of the appreciation of the dollar relative to foreign currencies was reversed as worldwide confidence returned. In the third phase, between November 2009 and June 2010, countries (particularly those in the euro area) began to see depreciation relative to the dollar resume (the dollar appreciated relative to the euro) amid concerns about the euro, due to problems in various EU countries (such as Portugal, Ireland, Iceland, Greece, and Spain, the so-called PIIGS). From June 2010 through August 2011 worries about Europe subsided somewhat and the U.S. government struggled to pass legislation allowing an increase in the national debt ceiling that would allow the country to avoid a potential default on U.S. sovereign debt. The dollar depreciated against many foreign currencies until a debt ceiling increase was passed on August 2, 2011. Despite a rating downgrade on U.S. debt by Standard & Poor's on August 5, 2011 (resulting from the inability of the U.S. Congress to stabilize the U.S. debt deficit situation in the long term), the dollar again appreciated relative to most foreign currencies in the period after August 2011 as fears of escalating problems in Europe, including a possible dissolution of the euro, led investors to again seek a safe haven in U.S. Treasury securities. In Figure 9-3, notice the lack of movement in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan between 2001 and 2005 and again between 2008 and 2010. As discussed above, during these periods the Chinese government intentionally pegged the yuan to the U.S. dollar.

Finally, in Figure 9-3 note the increase in the exchange rate of the British pound and the euro for the U.S. dollar in June 2016 when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Figure 9-4 highlights these currency trends in more detail, from June 1 through mid-July 2016. On June 23, 2016, following the vote, the pound fell to its lowest level in 30 years against the dollar. Market panic was exacerbated by the news that David Cameron would be stepping down as Prime Minister. In the following weeks, the pound saw volatility as a leadership contest within the Conservative Party ensued, resulting in Theresa May taking the helm on July 13, 2016. From the Article 50 enactment of the Lisbon Treaty to a pending Scottish Independence Referendum, the transition following the

Figure 9-4 Exchange Rate of the British Pound and Euro for the U.S. Dollar around the Brexit Vote

Brexit vote has brought unique challenges. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the section of EU law that outlines the process for a member state to formally exit the union, and it was officially invoked by the Prime Minister Theresa May on March 29, 2017. In the immediate aftermath of Article 50 being triggered, the British pound fell 0.3 percent against the U.S. dollar, extending post-Brexit Referendum losses to 17.5 percent.

Transition dealings officially began in November 2017 with the negotiation of the "divorce bill" between the UK and EU. The divorce bill outlined a cash settlement to be paid by the UK in compensation for its share of existing EU spending commitments. In the immediate aftermath of the divorce bill being announced, the British pound rallied 0.6 percent against the U.S. dollar, reaching two-month highs. The price action illustrated a common theme throughout the Brexit process: any elimination of uncertainty acted as a catalyst for gains in the pound sterling. After more than three-and-a-half years of debate, negotiations, and political turmoil, the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. As a result, much of the Brexit-driven political uncertainty that plagued the British pound subsided. Even though the value of the pound remained well beneath pre-2016 Brexit referendum levels, optimism toward the future boosted the British pound to yearly highs across the major currencies.

A forward foreign exchange transaction is the exchange of currencies at a specified exchange rate (or forward exchange rate) at some specified date in the future, as illustrated in Figure 9-2. An example is an agreement today (at time 0) to exchange dollars for pounds at a given (forward) exchange rate three months into the future. Forward contracts are typically written for one-, three-, or six-month periods, but in practice they can be written over any given length of time.

Of the  \$6.60 trillion in average daily trading volume in the foreign exchange markets in 2019,\$ 1.99 trillion (30.1 percent) involved spot transactions while  \$4.61 trillion (69.9 percent) involved forward and other transactions. This compares to 1989 where (as shown in Table 9-2) average daily trading volume was\$ 590 billion; 317 billion

(53.7 percent) of which was spot foreign exchange transactions and 273 billion (46.3 percent) forward and other foreign exchange transactions. The main reason for this increase in the use of forward relative to spot foreign exchange transactions is the increased ability to hedge foreign exchange risk with forward foreign exchange contracts (see below).

# LG 9-5

# Return and Risk of Foreign Exchange Transactions

This section discusses the extra dimensions of return and risk from foreign exchange transactions. The section also explores ways that financial institutions can hedge foreign exchange risk.

Measuring Risk and Return on Foreign Exchange Transactions. The risk involved with a spot foreign exchange transaction is that the value of the foreign currency may change relative to the U.S. dollar over a holding period. Further, foreign exchange risk is introduced by adding foreign currency assets and liabilities to a firm's balance sheet. Like domestic assets and liabilities, returns result from the contractual income from or costs paid on a security. With foreign assets and liabilities, however, returns are also affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.

# EXAMPLE 9-1 Foreign Exchange Risk

Suppose that on March 13, 2020, a U.S. firm plans to purchase 3 million Swiss francs' (Sf) worth of Swiss bonds from a Swiss FI in one month's time. The Swiss FI wants payment in Swiss francs. Believing that the exchange rate of U.S. dollars for Swiss francs will move against it in the next month, the U.S. firm will convert dollars into Swiss francs today. The spot exchange rate for March 13, 2020 (reported in Table 9-1), of U.S. dollars for Swiss francs (or CHF/USD) is 1.0521, or one franc costs 1.0521 in dollars. Consequently, the U.S. firm must convert:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{U .S .} \mathbb {S} / \mathrm{Sf} \text{ex ch an ge ra te} \times \mathrm{Sf} 3 \text{mi ll io n} = \\ 1. 0 5 2 1 \times \mathrm{Sf} 3 \mathrm{m} = \$ 3, 1 5 6, 3 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$ into Swiss francs today.


One month after the conversion of dollars to Swiss francs, the Swiss bond purchase deal falls through and the U.S. firm no longer needs the Swiss francs it purchased at  \$1.0521 per franc. The spot exchange rate of the Swiss franc to the dollar has fallen or depreciated over the month so that the value of a franc is worth only\$ 1.0375, or the exchange rate is 1.0375 per franc. The U.S. dollar value of 3 million Swiss francs is now only:

$$
1. 0 3 7 5 \times \mathrm{Sf} 3 \text{mi ll on} = \$ 3, 1 1 2, 5 0 0
$$

The depreciation of the Swiss franc relative to the dollar over the month has caused the U.S. firm to suffer a  $43,800 ($ 3,112,500 - 3,156,300) loss due to exchange rate fluctuations.

To avoid such a loss in the spot markets, the U.S. firm could have entered into a forward transaction, which is the exchange of currencies at a specified future date and a specified exchange rate (or forward exchange rate). Forward exchange rates for March 13, 2020, are also listed in Table 9-1. As mentioned previously, forward contracts are typically written for a one-, three-, or six-month period from the date the contract is written, although they can be written for any time period from a few days to many years. For example, if the U.S. firm had entered into a one-month forward contract selling the Swiss franc on March 13, 2020, at the same time it purchased the spot francs, the U.S. firm would have been guaranteed an exchange rate of 1.0502 U.S. dollars per Swiss franc, or 0.9522 Swiss francs per U.S. dollar, on delivering the francs to the buyer in one month's time. If the U.S. firm had sold francs one month forward at 1.0502 on March 13, 2020, it would have largely avoided the loss of 43,800 described in Example 9-1. Specifically, by selling 3 million francs forward, it would have received:


$$
2. 0 5 0 2 \times \mathrm{Sf} 3 \text{mi ll on} = \$ 3, 1 5 0, 6 0 0
$$ at the end of the month, suggesting a small net loss of  $3,150,600 -$ 3,156,300 = 5,700 on the combined spot and forward transactions. Essentially, by using the one-month forward contract, the U.S. firm hedges (or insures itself) against foreign currency risk in the spot market.

As discussed below, financial institutions, and particularly commercial banks, are the main participants in the foreign exchange markets. When issuing a foreign currency-denominated liability or buying a foreign currency-denominated asset an FI will do so only if the expected return is positive.

# EXAMPLE 9-2 Calculating the Return on Foreign Exchange Transactions of a U.S. FI

Suppose that a U.S. FI has the following assets and liabilities:

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>\$81.25 million U.S. loans (one year) in dollars</td><td>\$162.5 million U.S. CDs (one year) in dollars</td></tr><tr><td>81.25 million equivalent UK loans (one year) in pounds</td><td></td></tr></table>

The U.S. FI is raising all of its 162.5 million liabilities in dollars (one-year CDs), but it is investing 50 percent in U.S. dollar assets (one-year maturity loans) and 50 percent in British pound assets (one-year maturity loans). In this example, the FI has matched the maturity (M) or duration (D) of its assets (A) and liabilities (L):

$$
(M_{A} = M_{L} = D_{A} = D_{L} = 1 \text{ye ar})
$$ but has mismatched the currency composition of its asset and liability portfolios. Suppose that the promised one-year U.S. dollars CD rate is 8 percent, to be paid in dollars at the end of the year, and that one-year, default risk-free loans in the United States are yielding 9 percent. The FI would have a positive spread of 1 percent from investing domestically. Suppose, however, that credit risk-free one-year loans are yielding 15 percent in the United Kingdom.


To invest  \$81.25 million (of the\$ 162.5 million in CDs issued) in one-year loans in the United Kingdom, the U.S. FI engages in the following transactions:

1. At the beginning of the year, it sells \$81.25 million for pounds on the spot currency markets. If the exchange rate is \$1.30 to £1 (or GBP/USD = 1.30), this translates into 81.25 million/1.3 = £62.5 million.
2. It takes the £62.5 million and makes one-year UK loans at a 15 percent interest rate.
3. At the end of the year, pound revenue from these loans will be  $\pounds 62.5(1.15) = \pounds 71.875$  million.
4. It repatriates these funds back to the United States at the end of the year—that is, the U.S. FI sells the £71.875 million in the foreign exchange market at the spot exchange rate that exists at that time, the end of the year spot rate.

Suppose that the spot foreign exchange rate has not changed over the year—it remains fixed at  $1.30/£1$ . Then the dollar proceeds from the UK investment are:

$$

\begin{array}{l} £ 7 1. 8 7 5 \text{mi ll on} \times £ 1. 3 0 / £ 1 = £ 9 3. 4 3 7 5 \text{mi ll on} \\ \frac{\mathbb {S} 93.4375 \text{million} - \mathbb {S} 81.25 \text{million}}{\mathbb {S} 81.25 \text{million}} = 15 \% \\ \end{array}

$$

Given this, the weighted or average return on the FI's portfolio of investments would be:

$$

(0.5)(0.09) + (0.5)(0.15) = 0.12, \text{or} 12\%

$$

This exceeds the cost of the FI's CDs by 4 percent  $(12\% -8\%)$

Suppose, however, that the pound had fallen (depreciated) in value against the U.S. dollar from  \$1.30/£1 at the beginning of the year to\$ 1.18/£1 at the end of the year, when the FI needed to repatriate the principal and interest on the loan. At an exchange rate of 1.18/£1, the pound loan revenues at the end of the year translate into:

$$

£ 7 1. 8 7 5 \text{mi ll on} \times £ 1. 1 8 / £ 1 = £ 8 4. 8 1 2 5 \text{mi ll on}

$$ or as a return on the original dollar investment of:


$$

\frac{\mathbb {S} 84 . 8 1 2 5 - \mathbb {S} 8 1 . 2 5}{\mathbb {S} 8 1 . 2 5} = 0. 0 4 3 8 5 = 4. 3 8 5 \%

$$

The weighted return on the FI's asset portfolio would be:

$$

(0.5)(0.09) + (0.5)(0.04385) = 0.06692 = 6.692\%

$$

In this case, the FI actually has a loss or a negative interest margin (6.692\% - 8\% = -1.308\%) on its balance sheet investments. The reason for the loss is that the depreciation of the pound from  $1.30 to$ 1.18 has offset the attractively high yield on British pound loans relative to domestic U.S. loans.

If the pound had instead appreciated (risen in value) against the dollar over the year—say, to 1.400/£1—the U.S. FI would have generated a dollar return from its UK loans of:

$$

£ 7 1. 8 7 5 \text{mi ll on} \times \$ 1. 4 0 0 = \$ 1 0 0. 6 2 5 \text{mi ll on}

$$ or a percentage return of 23.846 percent. The U.S. FI would receive a double benefit from investing in the United Kingdom, a high yield on the domestic British loans and an appreciation in pounds over the one-year investment period.


Hedging Foreign Exchange Risk. Since a manager cannot know in advance what the pound/dollar spot exchange rate will be at the end of the year, a portfolio imbalance or investment strategy in which the bank is net long  \$81.25 million in pounds (or\$ 71.875 million) is risky. As we discussed, the British loans would generate a return of 23.846 percent if the pound appreciated from  $1.30/£1 to$ 1.40/£1, but would produce a return of only 4.385 percent if the pound were to depreciate in value against the dollar to 1.18.

Managers hedge to manage their exposure to currency risks, not to eliminate it. As in the case of interest rate risk exposure, it is not necessarily an optimal strategy to completely hedge away all currency risk exposure. By its very definition, hedging reduces a firm's risk by reducing the volatility of possible future returns. This narrowing of the probability distribution of returns reduces possible losses, but also reduces possible gains (i.e., it shortens both tails of the distribution). A hedge would be undesirable, therefore, if the firm wants to take a speculative position in a currency in order to benefit from some information about future currency rate movements. The hedge would reduce possible gains from the speculative position. In principle, an FI can better control the scale of its FX exposure in either of two major ways: on-balance-sheet hedging and off-balance-sheet hedging. On-balance-sheet hedging involves making changes in the on-balance-sheet assets and liabilities to protect the FI's profits from FX risk. Off-balance-sheet hedging involves no on-balance-sheet changes, but rather involves taking a position in forward or other derivative securities to hedge FX risk.


On-Balance-Sheet Hedging. The following example illustrates how an FI manager can control FX exposure by making changes on the balance sheet.

# EXAMPLE 9-3 Hedging on the Balance Sheet

Suppose that instead of funding the  \$81.25 million investment in 15 percent British loans with U.S. CDs, the FI manager funds the British loans with\$ 81.25 million equivalent one-year pound sterling CDs at a rate of 11 percent. Now the balance sheet of the FI would be as follows:

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>\$81.25 million U.S. loans (9\%) in dollars</td><td>\$81.25 million U.S. CDs (8\%) in dollars</td></tr><tr><td>\$81.25 million equivalent UK loans (15\%) in pounds</td><td>\$81.25 million equivalent UK CDs (11\%) in pounds</td></tr></table>

In this situation, the FI has both a matched maturity and foreign currency asset-liability book. We might now consider the FI's profitability or spreads between the return on assets and cost of funds under two scenarios: first, when the pound depreciates in value against the dollar over the year from  $1.30/£1 to$ 1.18/£1, and second, when the pound appreciates in value during the year from  $1.30/£1 to$ 1.40/£1.

1. The Depreciating Pound. When the pound falls in value to \$1.18/£1, the return on the British loan portfolio is 4.385 percent. Consider what happens to the cost of \$81.25 million in pound liabilities in dollar terms:

1. At the beginning of the year, the FI borrows \$81.25 million equivalent in pound CDs for one year at a promised interest rate of 11 percent. At an exchange rate of \$1.30/£1, this is a pound equivalent amount of borrowing of 81.25 million/1.30 = £62.50 million.
2. At the end of the year, the FI must pay the pound CD holders their principal and interest, £62.50 million (1.11) = £69.375 million.
 3. If the pound had depreciated to \$1.18/£1 over the year, the repayment in dollar terms would be \$81.8625 million (= £69.375 million times £1.18/£1), or a dollar cost of funds of 0.754 percent.

Thus, at the end of the year, the following occurs:

Average return on assets:

$$

(0.5)(0.9) + (0.5)(0.04385) = 0.06692 = 6.692\%

$$

U.S. asset return + UK asset return = Overall return

Average cost of funds:

$$

(0.5)(0.08) + (0.5)(0.00754) = 0.04377 = 4.377\%

$$

U.S. cost of funds + UK cost of funds = Overall cost

Net return:

Average return on assets - Average cost of funds

$$
6.692\% -4.377\% = 2.315\%
$$

2. The Appreciating Pound. When the pound appreciates over the year from  $1.30/£1 to$ 1.40/£1, the return on British loans equals 23.846 percent. Now consider the dollar cost of British one-year CDs at the end of the year when the U.S. FI must pay the principal and interest to the CD holder:

$$

£ 6 9. 3 7 5 \text{mi ll on} \times \$ 1. 4 0 / £ 1 = \$ 9 7. 1 2 5 \text{mi ll on}

$$ or a dollar cost of funds of 19.538 percent. Thus, at the end of the year:


Average return on assets:

$$

(0.5)(0.09) + (0.5)(0.23846) = 0.16423, \text{or} 16.423\%

$$

Average cost of funds:

$$

(0.5)(0.08) + (0.5)(0.19538) = 0.13769, \text{or} 13.769\%

$$

Net return:

$$
16.423 \% - 13.769 \% = 2.654 \%
$$

Thus, by directly matching its foreign asset and liability book, an FI can lock in a positive return or profit spread whichever direction exchange rates change over the investment period. For example, even if domestic U.S. banking is a relatively low-profit activity (i.e., there is a low spread between the return on assets and the cost of funds), the FI could be very profitable overall. Specifically, it could lock in a large positive spread—if it exists—between deposit rates and loan rates in foreign markets. In our example, a 4 percent positive spread occurred between British one-year loan rates and deposit rates compared to only a 1 percent spread domestically.

Note that for such imbalances in domestic spreads and foreign spreads to continue over long periods of time, financial service firms would have to face significant barriers to entry into foreign markets. Specifically, if real and financial capital were free to move, FIs would increasingly withdraw from the U.S. market and reorient their operations toward the United Kingdom. Reduced competition would widen loan deposit interest spreads in the United States, and increased competition would contract UK spreads until the profit opportunities from overseas activities disappeared. If there are no real or financial barriers to international capital and goods flows, FIs can eliminate all foreign exchange rate risk exposure. Sources of foreign exchange risk exposure include international differentials in real prices, cross-country differences in the real rate of interest (perhaps, as a result of differential rates of time preference), regulatory and government intervention, and restrictions on capital movements, trade barriers, and tariffs.

Hedging with Forwards. Instead of matching its  \$81.25 million foreign asset position with\$ 81.25 million of foreign liabilities, the FI might have chosen to remain with a currency mismatch on the balance sheet. Instead, as a lower-cost alternative, it could hedge by taking a position in the forward or other derivative markets for foreign currencies—for example, the one-year forward market for selling pounds for dollars. Any forward position taken would not appear on the balance sheet. It would appear as a contingent off-balance-sheet claim, which we describe as an item below the bottom line in Chapter 12. The role of the forward FX contract is to offset the uncertainty regarding the future spot rate on pounds at the end of the one-year investment horizon. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to transfer pounds back into dollars at an unknown spot rate, the FI can enter into a contract to sell forward its expected principal and interest earnings on the loan at today's known forward exchange rate for dollars/ pounds, with delivery of pound funds to the buyer of the forward contract taking place at the end of the year. Essentially, by selling the expected proceeds on the pound loan forward at a known (forward FX) exchange rate today, the FI removes the future spot exchange rate uncertainty and thus the uncertainty relating to investment returns on the British loan.

# EXAMPLE 9-4 Hedging with Forwards

Consider the following transactional steps when the FI hedges its FX risk by immediately selling its expected one-year pound loan proceeds in the forward FX market:

1. The U.S. FI sells \$81.25 million for pounds at the spot exchange rate today and receives \$81.25 million/1.30 = £62.50 million.

2. The FI then immediately lends the £62.50 million to a British customer at 15 percent for one year.
3. The FI also sells the expected principal and interest proceeds from the pound loan forward for dollars at today's forward rate for one-year delivery. Let the current forward one-year exchange rate between dollars and pounds stand at 1.25/£1 or at a 5 cent discount to the spot rate; as a percentage discount:

$$

(\$ 1.25 - \$ 1.30) / \$ 1.30 = -3.846 \%

$$

This means that the forward buyer of the pounds promises to pay:

$$

£ 62.50 \text{mi ll on} (1. 1 5) \times \$ 1. 2 5 / £ = £ 7 1. 8 7 5 \text{mi ll on} \times \$ 1. 2 5 / £ = \$ 8 9. 8 4 3 7 5 \text{mi ll on}

$$ to the FI (the forward seller) in one year when the FI delivers the £71.875 million proceeds of the loan to the forward buyer.


4. In one year, the British borrower repays the loan to the FI plus interest in pounds (£71.875 million).
 5. The FI delivers the £71.875 million to the buyer of the one-year forward contract and receives the promised 89.84375 million.

Barring the pound borrower's default on the loan or the pound forward buyer's reneging on the forward contract, the FI knows from the very beginning of the investment period that it has locked in a guaranteed return on the British loan of:

$$

\frac{\mathrm{89 .8 43 75 m .} - \mathrm{81 .2 5m .}}{\mathrm{81 .2 5m .}} = 0. 1 0 5 7 7, \text{or} 1 0. 5 7 7

$$

Specifically, this return is fully hedged against any dollar/pound exchange rate changes over the one-year holding period of the loan investment. Given this return on British loans, the overall expected return on the FI's asset portfolio is:

$$

(0.5)(0.09) + (0.5)(0.10577) = 0.09788, \text{or} 9.788\%

$$

Since the cost of funds for the FI's 200 million U.S. CDs is an assumed 8 percent, it has been able to lock in a return spread over the year of 1.788 percent regardless of spot exchange rate fluctuations between the initial overseas (loan) investment and repatriation of the foreign loan proceeds one year later.

In the preceding example, it is profitable for the FI to drop domestic U.S. loans and to hedge foreign UK loans, since the hedged dollar return on foreign loans of 10.577 percent is so much higher than the 9 percent return for domestic loans. As the FI seeks to invest more in British loans, it needs to buy more spot pounds. This drives up the spot price of pounds in dollar terms to more than  \$1.30/£1. In addition, the FI could sell more pounds forward (the proceeds of these pound loans) for dollars, driving the forward rate to below\$ 1.25/£1. The outcome would widen the dollar forward-spot exchange rate difference on pounds, making forward hedged pounds investments less attractive than before. This process would continue until the U.S. cost of FI funds just equals the forward hedged return on British loans—that is, the FI could make no further profits by borrowing in U.S. dollars and making forward contract-hedged investments in UK loans (see also the following discussion on the interest rate parity theorem). Futures and options foreign exchange contracts, as well as foreign exchange swaps, are other derivative securities that may be used to hedge foreign exchange risk. We discuss and illustrate the use of these contracts in Chapter 24.

# Role of Financial Institutions in Foreign Exchange Transactions

Foreign exchange market transactions, like corporate bond and money market transactions, are conducted among dealers mainly over the counter (OTC) using telecommunication and computer networks. Foreign exchange traders are generally located in one large trading room at a bank or other FI where they have access to foreign exchange data and telecommunications equipment. Traders generally specialize in just a few currencies.

A major structural change in foreign exchange trading has been the growing share of electronic brokerage in the interbank markets at the expense of direct dealing (and telecommunication). The transnational nature of the electronic exchange of funds makes secure, Internet-based trading an ideal platform. Online trading portals—terminals where currency transactions are being executed—are a low-cost way of conducting spot and forward foreign exchange transactions. In the 2000s, some 85 to 95 percent of interbank trading in major currencies was conducted by using electronic brokerage. This compares to 50 percent in 1998 and 20 to 30 percent in 1995. Refinitiv, FX Connect, and Bloomberg's FXGO, currently dominate the market for the provision of electronic trading platforms, software, and FX quotation systems. Electronic brokers automatically provide traders with the best prices available to them. In contrast, traders using traditional methods typically needed to contact several dealers to obtain market price information.

Since 1982, when Singapore opened its FX market, foreign exchange markets have operated 24 hours a day. When the New York market closes, trading operations in San Francisco are still open; when trading in San Francisco closes, the Hong Kong and Singapore markets open; when Tokyo and Singapore close, the Frankfurt market opens; an hour later, the London market opens; and before these markets close, the New York market reopens. The nation's largest commercial banks are major players in foreign currency trading and dealing, with large money center banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also taking significant positions in foreign currency assets and liabilities. Smaller banks maintain lines of credit with these large banks for foreign exchange transactions. Table 9-3 lists the top foreign currency traders as of 2019.

Table 9-4 lists the outstanding dollar value of U.S. banks' foreign assets and liabilities for the period 1993 to September 2019. The September 2019 figure for foreign assets is  \$617.75 billion, with foreign liabilities of\$ 326.09 billion. Both foreign currency liabilities and assets were growing during the mid-1990s and then fell in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The financial crises in Asia and Russia in 1997 and 1998 and in Argentina in the early 2000s are likely reasons for the decrease in foreign assets and liabilities during this period. After this period, growth accelerated rapidly as the world economy recovered. While the growth of liabilities to and asset claims on foreigners slowed during the financial crisis, levels remained stable as U.S. FIs were seen as some of the safest FIs during the crisis. Further, in many of the reported years (e.g., 2002 and 2007), U.S. banks had more

Thus, if the dollar depreciated relative to foreign currencies, more dollars (converted into foreign currencies) would be needed to pay off the liabilities and U.S. banks would experience a loss due to foreign exchange risk. However, the reverse was true in many of the most recent years (e.g., 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019); that is, as the dollar appreciated relative to foreign currencies, U.S. banks experienced a gain from their foreign exchange exposures.


Table 9-5 gives the categories of foreign currency positions (or investments) of all U.S. banks in five major currencies in October 2019. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9-5 refer to the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are held in the portfolios of U.S. banks. Columns 3 and 4 refer to foreign currency trading activities (the spot and forward foreign exchange contracts bought—a long position—and sold—a short position—in each major currency). Foreign currency trading dominates direct portfolio investments. Even though the aggregate trading positions appear very large—for example, U.S. banks bought 715,581 billion Japanese yen—their overall or net exposure positions can be relatively small (e.g., the net position in Japanese yen was ¥21,964 billion).

A financial institution's overall net foreign exchange (FX) exposure in any given currency can be measured by its net book or position exposure, which is measured in column 5 of Table 9-5 as:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text{Ne t} = \left(\mathrm{FX} \text{as se ts}_{i} - \mathrm{FX} \text{li ab il it ie s}_{i}\right) + \left(\mathrm{FX} \text{bo ug ht}_{i} - \mathrm{FX} \text{so ld}_{i}\right) \\ = \text{Ne t} \\ = \text{Ne t} \\ \end{array}

# net exposure

A financial institution's overall foreign exchange exposure in any given currency.

# net long (short) in a currency

A position of holding more (fewer) assets than liabilities in a given currency.

Clearly, a financial institution could match its foreign currency assets to its liabilities in a given currency and match buys and sells in its trading book in that foreign currency to reduce its foreign exchange net exposure to zero and thus avoid foreign exchange risk. It could also offset an imbalance in its foreign asset-liability portfolio by an opposing imbalance in its trading book so that its net exposure position in that currency would also be zero.

Notice in Table 9-5 that U.S. banks carried a positive net exposure position in two of the five major currencies in October 2019. A positive net exposure position implies that a U.S. financial institution is overall net long in a currency (i.e., the financial institution has purchased more foreign currency than it has sold). The institution will profit if the foreign currency appreciates in value against the U.S. dollar, but it also faces the risk that the foreign currency will fall in value against the U.S. dollar, the domestic currency. A negative net exposure position implies that a U.S. financial institution is net short (i.e., the financial institution has sold more foreign currency than it has purchased) in a foreign currency. The institution will profit if the foreign currency depreciates in value against the U.S. dollar, but it faces the risk that the foreign currency will rise in value against the dollar. Thus, failure to maintain a fully balanced position in any given currency exposes a U.S. financial institution to fluctuations in the exchange rate of that currency against the dollar. Indeed, the greater the volatility of foreign exchange rates given any net exposure position, the greater the fluctuations in value of a financial institution's foreign exchange portfolio (see also Chapter 20, where we discuss market risk). An FI's net position in a currency may not be completely under its own control. For example, even though an FI may feel that a particular currency will fall in value relative to the U.S. dollar, it may hold a positive net exposure in that currency because of many previous business loans issued to customers in that country. Thus, it is important that the FI manager recognize the potential for future foreign exchange losses and undertake hedging or risk management strategies like those described above (in Example 9-4) when making mediumand long-term decisions in nondomestic currencies.

We have given the foreign exchange exposures for U.S. banks only, but most large nonbank financial institutions also have some foreign exchange exposure either through asset-liability holdings or currency trading. The absolute sizes of these exposures are smaller than for major U.S. money center banks. The reasons for this are threefold: smaller asset sizes, prudent person concerns,[9] and regulations.[10] Table 9-6 shows international versus U.S.-based assets held by private pension funds from 1989 to 2019.

A financial institution's position in the foreign exchange markets generally reflects four trading activities:

1. The purchase and sale of foreign currencies to allow customers to partake in and complete international commercial trade transactions.

In the first two activities, the financial institution normally acts as an agent on behalf of its customers for a fee, but does not assume the foreign exchange risk itself. JPMorgan Chase is a dominant supplier of foreign exchange trading to retail customers in the United States. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate value of JPMorgan Chase's notional or principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts totaled 10.6 trillion. In the third activity, the financial institution acts defensively as a hedger to reduce foreign exchange exposure. For example, it may take a short (sell) position in the foreign exchange of a country to offset a long (buy) position in the foreign exchange of that same country. Thus, foreign exchange risk exposure essentially relates to open (or speculative) positions taken by the FI, the fourth activity. A financial institution usually creates open positions by taking an unhedged position in a foreign currency in its foreign exchange trading with other financial institutions. The Federal Reserve estimates that 200 financial institutions are active market makers in foreign currencies in the U.S. foreign exchange market, with about 25 commercial and investment banks making a market in the five most important currencies. Financial institutions can make speculative trades directly with other financial institutions or arrange them through specialist foreign exchange brokers. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that approximately 45 percent of speculative or open position trades are accomplished through specialized brokers who receive a fee for arranging trades between financial institutions. Speculative trades can be instituted through a variety of foreign exchange instruments. Spot currency trades are the most common, with financial institutions seeking to make a profit on the difference between buy and sell prices (i.e., movements in the purchase and sale prices over time). However, financial institutions can also take speculative positions in foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, and options (see Chapter 10).

# INTERACTION OF INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, AND EXCHANGE RATES

# LG 9-7

As global financial markets and financial institutions and their customers have become increasingly interlinked, so have interest rates, inflation, and foreign exchange rates. For example, higher domestic interest rates may attract foreign financial investment and impact the value of the domestic currency. In this section, we look at the effect that inflation (or the change in the price level of a given set of goods and services, defined earlier, in Chapter 2, as the variable  $IP$ ) in one country has on its foreign currency exchange rates—purchasing power parity (PPP). We also examine the links between domestic and foreign interest rates and spot and forward foreign exchange rates—interest rate parity (IRP).

Recall from Chapter 2 that the relationship among nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and expected inflation is often referred to as the Fisher effect, named for the economist Irving Fisher, who identified these relationships early in the last century. The Fisher effect theorizes that nominal interest rates observed in financial markets must (1) compensate investors for any reduced purchasing power due to inflationary price changes and (2) provide an additional premium above the expected rate of inflation for forgoing present consumption due to the time value of money (which reflects the real risk-free rate), such that

$$ i = I P + R F R
$$ where


$$

\begin{array}{l} i = \text{In te rs tr at e} \\ I P = \text{In fl at io nr at e} \\ R F R = \text{Re al} \\ \end{array}

$$

The international Fisher effect incorporates foreign exchange rates into the relationship, assuming the appreciation or depreciation of exchange rates is proportional to differences in nominal interest rates across countries. Specifically, the expected spot rate is the current spot rate multiplied by the ratio of the foreign nominal interest rate to the domestic nominal interest rate:

$$

E \left(S_{U S \ / C \}\right) = S_{U S \ / C \} \times \left[ (1 + i_{U S}) / (1 + i_{C}) \right]

$$

The country with the higher (lower) nominal interest rate will see its currency depreciate (appreciate). For example, suppose the spot exchange rate of U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars is 0.7709, the current nominal interest rate in the United States is 4 percent, and the nominal interest rate in Canada is 5 percent. The international Fisher effect predicts that:

$$

E \left(S_{U S \mathbb {S} / C \mathbb {S}}\right) = 0. 7 7 0 9 \times \left[ (1 + 0. 0 4) / (1 + 0. 0 5) \right] = 0. 7 6 3 6

$$

The international Fisher effect predicts that the U.S. dollar will appreciate to 0.7636 and the Canadian dollar will depreciate to 1.3097. Thus, investors in either currency will achieve the same average nominal rate of interest—that is, an investor in U.S. dollars will earn a lower interest rate of 4 percent but will also gain from appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.

# Purchasing Power Parity

One factor affecting a country's foreign currency exchange rate with another country is the relative inflation rate in each country (which, as shown below, is directly related to the relative interest rates in these countries). Specifically, in Chapter 2, we showed that:

$$ i_{U S} = I P_{U S} + R F R_{U S}
$$ and


$$ i_{S} = I P_{S} + R F R_{S}
$$ where


$$ i_{U S} = \text{In te rs tr at ei nt he Un it ed St at es}
$$

$$ i_{S} = \text{In te re st ra te in Sw it ze rl an d (or an ot he rf or gi nc no ut ry)}
$$

$$
I P_{U S} = \text{In fl at io nr at ei nt he Un it ed St at es}
$$

$$
I P_{S} = \text{In fl at io nr at ei nS wi tz er la nd (or an ot he rf or gi nc ou nt ry)}
$$

$$
R F R_{U S} = \text{Re al}
$$

$$
R F R_{S} = \text{Re al}
$$

Assuming real rates of interest (or rates of time preference) are equal across countries:

$$
R F R_{U S} = R F R_{S}
$$ then:


$$ i_{U S} - i_{S} = I P_{U S} - I P_{S}
$$

The (nominal) interest rate spread between the United States and Switzerland reflects the difference in inflation rates between the two countries.

As relative inflation rates (and interest rates) change, foreign currency exchange rates that are not constrained by government regulation should also adjust to account for relative differences in the price levels (inflation rates) between the two countries. One theory that explains how this adjustment takes place is the theory of purchasing power parity (PPP). According to PPP, foreign currency exchange rates between two countries adjust to reflect changes in each country's price levels (or inflation rates and, implicitly, interest

# purchasing power parity (PPP)

The theory explaining the change in foreign currency exchange rates as inflation rates in the countries change.

rates) as consumers and importers switch their demands for goods from relatively high inflation (interest) rate countries to low inflation (interest) rate countries. Specifically, the PPP theorem states that the change in the exchange rate between two countries' currencies is proportional to the difference in the inflation rates in the two countries. That is:

$$
I P_{U S} - I P_{S} = \Delta S_{U S / S} / S_{U S / S}
$$ where


$S_{US/S} = \text{SpotexchangerateofU.S.dollarsforSwissfrancs (oranothercurrency)}$

Thus, according to PPP, the most important factor determining exchange rates is the fact that in open economies, differences in prices (and by implication, price level changes with inflation) drive trade flows and thus demand for and supplies of currencies.

# EXAMPLE 9-5 Application of Purchasing Power Parity

Suppose that the current spot exchange rate of U.S. dollars for Russian rubles,  $S_{US/R}$  (or  $S_{RUB/USD}$ ), is 0.017 (i.e., 0.017 dollars, or 1.7 cents, can be received for 1 ruble). The price of Russian-produced goods increases by 7.5 percent (i.e., inflation in Russia,  $IP_R$ , is 7.5 percent) and the U.S. price index increases by 0.8 percent (i.e., inflation in the United States,  $IP_{US}$ , is 0.8 percent). According to PPP, the 7.5 percent rise in the price of Russian goods relative to the 0.8 percent rise in the price of U.S. goods results in a depreciation of the Russian ruble (by 6.7 percent). Specifically, the exchange rate of Russian rubles to U.S. dollars should fall over the course of the year, so that:

$$

\begin{array}{c c} \text{U .S .} & - \text{Ru ss ia n} \\ \text{in fl at io nr at e} & \text{in fl at io nr at e} \end{array} = \frac{\text{Ch an ge in sp ot ex ch an ge ra te}}{\text{Of U .S .d ol la rs fo rR us si an ru bl es}}

$$ or


$$

I P_{U S} - I P_{R} = \Delta S_{U S / R} / S_{U S / R}

$$

Plugging in the inflation and exchange rates, we get:

$$
0. 0 0 8 - 0. 0 7 5 = \Delta S_{U S I R} / S_{U S I R} = \Delta S_{U S I R} / 0. 0 1 7
$$ or


$$
- 0. 0 6 7 = S_{U S / R} / 0. 0 1 7
$$ and


$$

\Delta S_{U S / R} = - (0. 0 6 7) \times 0. 0 1 7 = - 0. 0 0 1 1 3 9

$$

Thus, it takes 0.01139 cents less to receive a ruble [or 1.6986 cents (1.7 cents – 0.001139 cents), or 0.016986 of 1, can be received for 1 ruble]. Over the course of the year, the Russian ruble depreciates in value by 6.7 percent against the U.S. dollar as a result of its higher inflation rate.[12]

# law of one price

An economic rule which states that, in an efficient market, identical goods and services produced in different countries should have a single price.

The theory behind purchasing power parity is that in the long run exchange rates should move toward rates that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in any two countries. This is also known as the law of one price, an economic concept which states that in an efficient market, if countries produce a good or service that is identical to that in other countries, that good or service must have a single price, no matter where it is purchased. This is the thinking behind The Economist's "Big Mac" index, proposed in 1986 as a lighthearted measure of whether currencies are at their correct level. The "basket" in the Big Mac index is a McDonald's Big Mac, which is produced locally in almost 120 countries. For example, in January 2020, a Big Mac cost 3.39 pounds in Britain and  \$5.67 in the United States. The implied exchange rate is 0.60. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate, 0.77, suggests the British pound was 22.2 percent undervalued against the U.S. dollar in January 2020. Similarly, a Big Mac cost 6.50 Swiss francs in Switzerland, compared to\$ 5.67 in the United States. The implied exchange rate is 1.15. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate, 0.97, suggests the Swiss franc was 18.4 overvalued against the U.S. dollar. The Big Mac index was never intended as a precise forecasting tool. Burgers are not "traded" across borders as the PPP theory demands; prices are distorted by differences in the cost of nontradable goods and services, such as property rents. Yet these very failings make the Big Mac index useful, since looked at another way it can help measure countries' differing costs of living. That a Big Mac is cheap in China does not in fact prove that the yuan is being held massively below its fair value. It is quite natural for average prices to be lower in poorer countries and therefore for their currencies to appear cheap.


# Interest Rate Parity

We discussed above that foreign exchange spot market risk can be reduced by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts. Table 9-1 lists foreign exchange rates on March 13, 2020. Notice that spot rates and forward rates differ. For example, the spot exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar was 0.7243 on March 13, 2020, meaning that one Canadian dollar could be exchanged on March 13, 2020, for 0.7243 U.S. dollar. The six-month forward rate between the two currencies on March 13, 2020, was 0.7151. This forward exchange rate is determined by the spot exchange rate and the interest rate differential between the two countries.

# interest rate parity theorem (IRPT)

The theory that the domestic interest rate should equal the foreign interest rate minus the expected appreciation of the domestic currency.

The relationship that links spot exchange rates, interest rates, and forward exchange rates is described as the interest rate parity theorem (IRPT). Given that investors have an opportunity to invest in domestic or foreign markets, the IRPT implies that, by hedging in the forward exchange rate market, an investor should realize the same returns, whether investing domestically or in a foreign country—that is, the hedged dollar return on foreign investments just equals the return on domestic investments. This is consistent with the assumption of PPP that real rates of interest are equal across countries. Mathematically, the IRPT can be expressed as:

$$

1 + i_{U S t} = \left(1 / S_{t}\right) \times \left(1 + i_{U K t}\right) \times F_{t}

$$

Return on U.S. investment  $=$  Hedged return on foreign (UK) investment where


$$

1 + i_{U S t} = 1 \text{pl us th ei nt er st ra te ro na U .S .i nv es tm at ur in ga ti me t} t

$$

$$

1 + i_{U K t} = 1 \text{pl us th ei nt er se ra to na UK in ve ns tm at ur in ga ti me} t

$$

$$

S_{t} = \mathbb {S} / £ \text{sp ot ex ch an ge ra te} t

$$

$$

F_{t} = \mathbb {S} / £ \text{fo rw ar de xp ar ag er at ea tt im e} t

$$

Rearranging, the IRPT can be expressed as:

$$

(i_{U S t} - i_{U K t}) / (1 + i_{U K t}) = \left(F_{t} - S_{t}\right) / S_{t}

$$

As can be seen, if interest rates in the United States and a foreign country are the same (i.e.,  $i_{USt} = i_{UKt}$ ) so that the left-hand side of the equation is zero, then the forward rate should equal the spot exchange rate ( $F_t = S_t$ ) since the right-hand side of the equation must also equal zero. If U.S. interest rates are higher than foreign rates, the forward dollar value of the foreign currency will be greater than the spot dollar value, since investors can earn more over the investment horizon in the United States than in the foreign market. If U.S. interest rates are lower than foreign rates, the forward dollar value of the foreign currency will be less than the spot dollar value, since investors can earn more in foreign markets than in U.S. markets. Finally, note from the IRPT that a change in U.S. interest rates  $(i_{USt})$ , foreign interest rates  $(i_{UKt})$ , and expected exchange rates  $(F_t)$  affects the current exchange rate,  $S_t$ .


# EXAMPLE 9-6 An Example of the Interest Rate Parity Theorem

Suppose that on March 13, 2020, a U.S. citizen has excess funds available to invest in either U.S. or British bank time deposits. It is assumed that both types of deposits are credit- or default-risk free and that the investment horizon is one month. The interest rate available on British pound one-month time deposits,  $i_{UK}$ , is 0.5 percent monthly. The spot exchange rate of U.S. dollars for British pounds on March 13, 2020 (from Table 9-1), is  $1.2284/£$ , and the one-month forward rate is  $1.2415/£$ . According to the IRPT, the interest rate on comparable U.S. one-month time deposits should be:

$$

1 + i_{U S} = (1 / 1. 2 2 8 4) \times (1 + 0. 0 0 5) \times 1. 2 4 1 5 = 1. 0 1 5 7 1 8

$$ or 1.5718 percent. We can rearrange this relationship as shown above as:


$$

\begin{array}{l} \frac{0 . 0 1 5 7 1 8 - 0 . 0 0 5}{1 + 0 . 0 0 5} = \frac{1 . 2 4 1 5 - 1 . 2 2 8 4}{1 . 2 2 8 4} \\ 0. 0 1 0 6 6 4 = 0. 0 1 0 6 6 4 \\ \end{array}

$$

Thus, the discounted spread between domestic and foreign interest rates is, in equilibrium, equal to the percentage spread between forward and spot exchange rates.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

7. What the term purchasing power parity means?
8. What the interest rate parity condition is? How it relates to the existence or nonexistence of arbitrage opportunities?

Suppose that, in the preceding example, the annual rate on U.S. time deposits was 1.65 percent per month (rather than 1.5718 percent). In this case, it would be profitable for the investor to put any excess funds into U.S. rather than UK time deposits. In fact, a risk-free (or arbitrage) investment opportunity now exists and will result in a flow of funds out of UK time deposits into U.S. time deposits. According to the IRPT, this flow of funds will quickly drive up the U.S. dollar for British pound spot exchange rate until the potential risk-free profit opportunities from investment in U.S. time deposits are eliminated. Thus, any arbitrage opportunity should be small and fleeting. Any long-term violations of this relationship are likely to occur only if major imperfections exist in international deposit markets, including barriers to cross-border financial flows.

# DERIVATIVE SECURITIES: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

A derivative security is a financial security whose payoff is linked to another, previously issued security. Derivative securities generally involve an agreement between two parties to exchange a standard quantity of an asset or cash flow at a predetermined price and at a specified date in the future. As the value of the underlying security to be exchanged changes, the value of the derivative security changes. Derivatives involve the buying and selling, or transference, of risk. Under normal circumstances, trading in derivatives should not adversely affect the economic system because it allows individuals who want to bear risk to take more risk, while allowing individuals who want to avoid risk to transfer that risk elsewhere. Indeed, in 2003 former Federal Reserve Board chair Alan Greenspan credited the derivative securities markets with helping the banking system maintain its strength through the economic recession in the early 2000s.

However, derivative securities' traders can experience large losses if the price of the underlying asset moves against them significantly. Indeed, at the very heart of the recent financial crisis were losses associated with off-balance-sheet derivative securities created
