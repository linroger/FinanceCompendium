and held by FIs. These losses resulted in the failure, acquisition, or bailout of some of the largest FIs (including investment banks Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch; savings institution Washington Mutual; insurance company AIG; commercial bank Citigroup; finance company Countrywide Financial; and government-sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and a near meltdown of the world's financial and economic systems. Losses from the falling value of subprime mortgages and off-balance-sheet securities backed by these mortgages reached over 1 trillion worldwide through 2009.

A securitized asset such as a mortgage-backed security (see Chapter 7) is a derivative security in that its value is based on the value of an underlying security (e.g., a mortgage). Option contracts are also derivatives since their value depends on the price of some underlying security (e.g., a stock) relative to a reference (or strike) price. Derivative securities markets are the markets in which derivative securities trade. While derivative securities have been in existence for centuries, the growth in derivative securities markets has occurred mainly since the 1970s. As major markets, therefore, the derivative securities markets are the newest of the financial security markets.

The first of the modern wave of derivatives to trade were foreign currency futures contracts. These contracts were introduced by the International Monetary Market (IMM), now a subsidiary of the CME Group, in response to the introduction of floating exchange rates between currencies of different countries following the Smithsonian Agreements of 1971 and 1973 (see Chapter 9).

The second wave of derivative security growth was with interest rate derivative securities. Their growth was mainly in response to increases in the volatility of interest rates in the late 1970s and after, as the Federal Reserve started to target nonborrowed reserves (see Chapter 4) rather than interest rates. Financial institutions such as banks and savings institutions had many rate-sensitive assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. As interest rate volatility increased, the sensitivity of the net worth (equity) of these institutions to interest rate shocks increased as well. In response, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) introduced numerous short-term and long-term interest rate futures contracts in the 1970s and stock index futures and options in the 1980s. Accordingly, financial institutions are the major participants in the derivative securities markets. Financial institutions can be either users of derivative contracts for hedging (see Chapter 24); dealers that act as counterparties in trades with customers for a fee; or arbitrageurs, buying in one market (i.e., the spot market) and simultaneously selling in another market (i.e., the futures market) to make a risk-free profit when there is a mismatch between the two prices. Approximately 1,330 U.S. banks use derivatives and only four large dealer banks—JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America—account for some 87 percent of the derivatives that user banks hold. In addition, interest rate notional amounts represent the majority of banks' derivative holdings at 147.1 trillion, or 73.1 percent of total derivatives, as of September 2019.^{1}

A third wave of derivative security innovations occurred in the 1990s and 2000s with credit derivatives (e.g., credit forwards, credit risk options, and credit swaps). For example, a credit forward is a forward agreement that hedges against an increase in default risk on a loan (a decline in the credit quality of a borrower) after the loan rate is determined and the loan is issued. Although the credit protection buyer hedges exposure to default risk, there is still counterparty credit risk in the event that the seller fails to perform his or her obligations under the terms of the contract (as was the concern in September 2008 with regard to AIG, an active credit default swap seller). In September 2019, the notional value of credit derivatives held by U.S. banks was approximately \$4.1 trillion, down from \$6.6 trillion in September 2016 and 12.8 trillion in September 2013. As we discuss later in the chapter, part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis, is the Volcker Rule which prohibits U.S. depository institutions (DIs) from engaging in proprietary trading (i.e., trading as a principal for the trading account of the bank). This includes any transaction to purchase or sell derivatives such as credit derivatives. Thus, only the investment banking arm of the business is allowed to conduct such trading. The Volcker Rule was implemented in April 2014 and banks had until July 21, 2015, to be in compliance. The result has been a reduction in credit derivatives held off-balance-sheet by these financial institutions. These derivative securities have become particularly useful for managing credit risk of emerging-market countries and credit portfolio risk in general.

The rapid growth of derivatives use by both FIs and nonfinancial firms has been controversial. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics charged that derivatives contracts contain potential losses that can materialize, particularly for banks and insurance companies that deal heavily in these instruments. As will be discussed in this chapter and the following two chapters, when employed appropriately, derivatives can be used to hedge or reduce an FI's risk. However, when misused, derivatives can increase the risk of an FI's insolvency. In the 1990s, a number of scandals involving FIs, firms, and municipalities (such as Bankers Trust and the Allied Irish Bank) led to a tightening of the accounting (reporting) requirements for derivative contracts. Specifically, beginning in 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) required all derivatives to be marked to market and mandated that losses and gains be immediately transparent on FIs' and other firms' financial statements. Then in the late 2000s, billions of dollars of losses on derivative securities and the near collapse of the world's financial markets led to a call for major regulations to be imposed on the trading of derivative securities. These regulations were intended to bring many over-the-counter derivative contracts made between financial institutions under federal regulation and to empower securities and commodities regulators to police them. The result has been a significant drop in derivative securities held by commercial banks from a high of  \$249.3 trillion in June 2011 to\$ 201.1 trillion in September 2019.

In this chapter, we present an overview of the derivative securities markets. We look at the markets for forwards, futures, options, swaps, and some special derivative contracts (caps, floors, and collars). We define the various derivative securities and focus on the markets themselves—their operations and trading processes. In Chapter 24, we describe in detail how these securities can be used to manage and hedge the foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit risks of financial institutions.

# FORWARDS AND FUTURES

LG 10-1

# spot contract

An agreement to transact involving the immediate exchange of assets and funds.

To present the essential nature and characteristics of forward and futures contracts and markets, we compare them with spot contracts. We define each in Table 10-1. We illustrate appropriate time lines for each of the three contracts using a bond as the underlying financial security to the derivative contract in Figure 10-1.

# Spot Markets

A spot contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller at time 0, when the seller of the asset agrees to deliver it immediately and the buyer agrees to pay for that

# TABLE 10-1 Spot, Forward, and Futures Contracts

Spot contract—agreement made between a buyer and a seller at time 0 for the seller to deliver the asset immediately and the buyer to pay for the asset immediately.

Forward contract—agreement between a buyer and a seller at time 0 to exchange a nonstandardized asset for cash at some future date. The details of the asset and the price to be paid at the forward contract expiration date are set at time 0. The price of the forward contract is fixed over the life of the contract.

Futures contract—agreement between a buyer and a seller at time 0 to exchange a standardized asset for cash at some future date. Each contract has a standardized expiration and transactions occur in a centralized market. The price of the futures contract changes daily as the market value of the asset underlying the futures fluctuates.

A spot bond quote of  \$97 for a 20-year maturity bond is the price the buyer must pay the seller, per\$ 100 of face value, for immediate (time 0) delivery of the 20-year bond.

Figure 10-1 Contract Time Line

Spot transactions occur because the buyer of the asset believes its value will increase in the immediate future (over the investor's holding period). If the value of the asset increases as expected, the investor can sell the asset at its higher price for a profit. For example, if the 20-year bond increases in value to $99 per $100 of face value, the investor can sell the bond for a profit of $2 per $100 of face value.

# Forward Markets

# forward contract

An agreement to transact involving the future exchange of a set amount of assets at a set price.

Forward Contracts. A forward contract is a contractual agreement between a buyer and a seller at time 0 to exchange a prespecified asset for cash at some later date at a price set at time 0. Market participants take a position in forward contracts because the future (spot) price or interest rate on an asset is uncertain. Rather than risk that the future spot price will move against them—that the asset will become more expensive to buy in the future—forward traders pay a financial institution a fee to arrange a forward contract. Such a contract lets the market participant hedge the risk that future spot prices on an asset will move against him or her by guaranteeing a future price for the asset today.

For example, in a three-month forward contract to deliver  \$100 face value of 10-year bonds, the buyer and seller agree on a price and amount today (time 0), but the delivery (or exchange) of the 10-year bond for cash does not occur until three months into the future. If the forward price agreed to at time 0 was\$ 98 per 100 of face value, in three months' time the seller delivers \$100 of 10-year bonds and receives \$98 from the buyer. This is the price the buyer must pay and the seller must accept no matter what happens to the spot price of 10-year bonds during the three months between the time the contract is entered into and the time the bonds are delivered for payment (i.e., whether the spot price falls to \$97 or below or rises to \$99 or above).

In Chapter 9, we discussed the market for forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which allows market participants to buy or sell a specified currency for a specified price at a specified date (e.g., one-month, three-month, or six-month contracts are standard). Forward contracts can also be based on a specified interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) rather than a specified asset (called forward rate agreements, or FRAs). The buyer of a FRA agrees to pay the contract rate based on some notional principal amount (e.g.,  \$1 million)—he or she buys the notional amount at the stated interest rate. The seller of a FRA agrees to sell the funds to the buyer at the stated rate. For example, for a three-month FRA written today with a notional value of\$ 1 million and a contract rate of 1.70 percent, the buyer of the FRA agrees to pay 1.70 percent (the current three-month LIBOR rate) to borrow \$1 million starting three months from now. The seller of the FRA agrees to lend \$1 million to the buyer at 1.70 percent starting three months from now. If interest rates rise in the next three months, the FRA buyer benefits from the FRA. He or she can borrow 1 million at the rate stated on the FRA (1.70 percent) rather than at the higher market rate (say, 2 percent).

Forward contracts often involve underlying assets that are nonstandardized, because the terms of each contract are negotiated individually between the buyer and the seller (e.g., a contract between Bank A to buy from Bank B, six months from now, 1 million in 30-year Treasury bonds with a coupon rate of 2.50 percent). As a result, the buyer and seller involved in a forward contract must locate and deal directly with each other in the over-the-counter market to set the terms of the contract rather than transacting the sale in a centralized market (such as a futures market exchange).

Forward Markets. Commercial banks (see Chapter 11) and investment banks and broker-dealers (see Chapter 16) are the major forward market participants, acting as both principals and agents. These financial institutions make a profit on the spread between the price at which they buy and sell the asset underlying the forward contracts.

Each forward contract is originally negotiated between the financial institution and the customer, and therefore the details of each (e.g., price, expiration, size, delivery date) can be unique. Most forward contracts are tailor-made contracts that are negotiated between two parties. Thus, there is a risk of default by either party. If an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction is not structured carefully, it may pass along unintended risks to participants, exposing them to higher frequency and severity of losses than if they had held an equivalent cash position. As the forward market has grown over the last decade, however, traders have begun making secondary markets in some forward contracts, communicating the buy and sell prices on the contracts over computer networks. As of September 2019, U.S. commercial banks held over 43.1 trillion of forward contracts that were listed for trading in the over-the-counter markets. The advent of this secondary market trading has resulted in an increase in the standardization of forward contracts. It has also become increasingly easy to get out of a forward position by taking an offsetting forward position in the secondary market. Secondary market activity in forward contracts has made them more attractive to firms and investors that had previously been reluctant to get locked into a forward contract until expiration. Secondary market activity has also resulted in a situation in which the differences between forward and future contracts have significantly narrowed.

In recent years credit derivative instruments have been developed to better allow financial institutions to hedge their credit risk. Credit derivatives can be used to hedge the credit risk on individual loans or a portfolio of loans. The credit derivative market, while still relatively young, has gained a reputation as an early warning signal for spotting corporate debt problems. One such credit derivative instrument is a credit forward. A credit forward is a forward agreement that hedges against an increase in default risk on a loan (a decline in the credit quality of a borrower) after the loan rate is determined and the loan is issued by a bank. Common buyers of credit forwards are banks and common sellers are insurance companies.

Futures Contracts. A futures contract is normally traded on an organized exchange such as the ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Futures U.S. A futures contract, like a forward contract, is an agreement between a buyer and a seller at time 0 to exchange a standardized, prespecified asset at some later date at a price set at time 0. Thus, a futures contract is very similar to a forward contract. One difference between forwards and futures is that forward contracts are bilateral contracts subject to counterparty default risk, but the default risk on futures is significantly reduced by the futures exchange guaranteeing to indemnify counterparties against credit or default risk. Another difference relates to the contract's price, which in a forward contract is fixed over the life of the contract (e.g.,  $98 per$ 100 of face value for three months to be paid on expiration of the forward contract), whereas a futures contract is marked to market daily. This means that the contract's price is adjusted each day as the price of the asset underlying the futures contract changes and as the contract approaches expiration. Therefore, actual daily cash settlements occur between the buyer and seller in response to these price changes (this is called marking to market). This can be compared to a forward contract. While the value of a forward contract can change daily between when the buyer and seller agree on the deal and the maturity date of the forward contract, cash payment from buyer to seller occurs only at the end of the contract period. Marking futures contracts to market ensures that both parties to the futures contract maintain sufficient funds in their account to guarantee the eventual payoff when the contract matures. For the buyers of the futures contract, marking to market can result in unexpected payments from their account if the price of the futures contract moves against them.

With a futures contract, like a forward contract, a person or firm makes a commitment to deliver an asset (such as foreign exchange) at some future date. If a counterparty were to default on a futures contract, however, the exchange would assume the defaulting party's position and payment obligations. Thus, unless a systematic financial market collapse threatens an exchange itself, futures are essentially default-risk free. In addition, the default risk of a futures contract is less than that of a forward contract for at least four reasons: (1) daily marking to market of futures (so that there is no buildup of losses or gains), (2) margin requirements on futures that act as a security bond should a counterparty default, (3) price movement limits that spread extreme price fluctuations over time, and (4) default guarantees by the futures exchange itself.

Futures Markets. Futures trading occurs on organized exchanges—for example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), both of which are part of the CME Group. Financial futures market trading was introduced in 1972 with the establishment of foreign exchange future contracts on the International Money Market (IMM). In 2019, several major exchanges existed in the United States as well as abroad. Table 10-2 lists the characteristics of some of the most widely traded financial futures contracts. Futures contracts also exist on commodity (e.g., corn, wheat), energy (e.g., electricity), metals (e.g., copper, gold), and other (e.g., weather) contracts as well. Figure 10-2 shows the notional value of futures and forwards held by commercial

4. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is the world's largest physical commodity futures exchange, located in New York City. The New York Mercantile Exchange handles billions of dollars' worth of energy products, metals, and other commodities (e.g., crude oil, gasoline, gold, and propane) being bought and sold on the trading floor and the overnight electronic trading computer systems. The prices quoted for transactions on the exchange are the basis for prices that people pay throughout the world. The floor of the NYMEX is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
5. These include the CME Group (which includes the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange Inc., and the Kansas City Board of Trade), CBOE Holdings, and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
6. Some of these include the Liffe (in London, which is part of the ICE), the Singapore Exchange (SGX), the Eurex (in Germany), the National Stock Exchange of India, the Shanghai Futures Exchange, and the Montreal Exchange (part of the TMX Group).

banks from 1992 through 2018. The terms of futures contracts (e.g., contract size, delivery month, trading hours, minimum price fluctuation, daily price limits, and process used for delivery) traded in the United States are set by the exchange and are subject to the approval of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the principal regulator of futures markets. For example, the contract terms for 10-year T-note futures are listed in Table 10-3.

Trading on most of the largest exchanges such as the CBOT has historically taken place in trading "pits." A trading pit consists of circular steps leading down to the center of the pit. Traders for each delivery date on a futures contract informally group together in the trading pit. Futures trading occurs using an open-outcry auction method where traders face each other and "cry out" their offer to buy or sell a stated number of futures contracts at a stated price. However, the 2000s saw the rise in derivative trading on electronic exchanges. In 2004 Eurex, the world's largest derivatives exchange, launched a fully electronic exchange in the United States. Based in Chicago, this exchange offers futures and options on U.S. Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds as well as 2-, 5-, and 10-year contracts on euro interest rate contracts. By 2019, trading volume on Eurex exceeded 1.5 billion contracts annually, including futures and options on stocks, bonds, commodities, and financial indexes. In 1992, the CME Group launched the CME Globex, which over time has become the world's leading electronic trading platform. Customers trade on CME Globex around the globe and virtually around the clock. Further, in 2008, the ICE Futures U.S. announced that floor trading of all ICE Futures U.S. futures contracts would end at the close of trading on February 29, 2008. Effective March 1, 2008, these futures contracts now trade exclusively on the ICE electronic trading platform. Electronic trading offers advantages of high-speed trade execution, transparency in trading, and global access in the trading process. Finally, in July 2015 the CME Group closed all open-outcry trading pits except for the S&P contracts and moved all trading to electronic platforms. As of 2019, CME Group handles 3 billion contracts annually, and Globex trades constitute 90 percent of CME Group's volume.

Only futures exchange members are allowed to transact on futures exchanges. Trades from the public are placed with a floor broker. When an order is placed, a floor broker may trade with another floor broker or with a professional trader. Professional traders are similar to designated market makers on the stock exchanges in that they trade for their

own account. Professional traders are also referred to as position traders, day traders, or scalpers. Position traders take a position in the futures market based on their expectations about the future direction of prices of the underlying assets. Day traders generally take a position within a day and liquidate it before day's end. Scalpers take positions for very short periods of time, sometimes only minutes, in an attempt to profit from this active trading. Scalpers do not have an affirmative obligation to provide liquidity to futures markets but do so in expectation of earning a profit. Scalpers' profits are related to the bid-ask spread and the length of time a position is held. Specifically, it has been found that scalper trades held longer than three minutes, on average, produce losses to scalpers. Thus, this need for a quick turnover of a scalper's position enhances futures market liquidity and is therefore valuable.

Similar to trading in the stock market (see Chapter 8), futures trades may be placed as market orders (instructing the floor broker to transact at the best price available) or limit orders (instructing the floor broker to transact at a specified price). The order may be for a purchase of the futures contract in which the futures holder takes a long position in the futures contract, or the order may be for a sale of the futures contract in which the futures holder takes a short position in the futures contract.

Once a futures price is agreed upon, the two parties do not complete the deal with each other but rather (as illustrated in Figure 10-3) with the clearinghouse overseeing the exchange. The exchange's clearinghouse guarantees all trades made by exchange traders. The clearinghouse breaks up every trade into a buy and sell transaction and takes the opposite side of the transaction, becoming the buyer for every futures contract seller (transaction 1 in Figure 10-3) and the seller for every futures contract buyer (transaction 2 in Figure 10-3). Thus, the clearinghouse ensures that all trading obligations are met. Clearinghouses are able to perform their function as guarantor of an exchange's futures contracts by requiring all member firms to deposit sufficient funds (from customers' margin accounts) to ensure that the firm's customers will meet the terms of any futures contract entered into on the exchange.

Table 10-4 shows futures quotes from CME Group website for March 13, 2020. The three types of financial futures contracts are interest rate futures, currency futures, and equity index futures. The underlying asset on an interest rate futures contract is a bond or a short-term fixed-interest security's price or interest rate (e.g., Treasury securities, Eurodollar CDs); on a currency contract, it is an exchange rate (e.g., yen to U.S. dollar); and on an index futures contract, it is a major U.S. or foreign stock market index (e.g., the Dow Jones Industrial Average—see Chapter 8). Look at the quote for Treasury bond interest rate futures contracts. The bold heading of each quote contains information about the underlying deliverable asset (e.g., Treasury bonds) on the futures contract, the face value of a contract, and the basis for quoted prices. For example, Treasury bond price of  $178'08$  means 178 8/32 percent (178.25 percent). Treasury securities of shorter maturities are quoted in finer increments than 1/32nd. For example, a five-year Treasury note price of  $123'165$  means 123 percent plus 16/32nds of a percent plus 5/8ths of 1/32nd percent, or 5/256ths of a percent ( $123 + 0.5 + 0.0195 = 123.5195$ ). Each row of the quote provides information

A holder of a futures contract has two choices for liquidating his or her position: liquidate the position before the futures contract expires, or hold the futures contract to expiration. To liquidate before the expiration date, the futures holder simply calls his or her broker and requests an offsetting trade to his or her original position, an opposite position. For example, if the original transaction was a buy or long position, the trader can sell or short the same futures contract. Thus, any losses on the buy position will be exactly offset by gains on the sell position over the remaining life (time) to expiration of the contract. Generally, a vast majority (99 percent) of all futures positions are liquidated before maturity. If the futures holder keeps the futures contract to expiration, the parties will either (as specified in the futures contract) conduct a cash settlement where the traders exchange cash based on the final price of the underlying asset relative to the futures price, or the futures holder will take delivery of the underlying asset (e.g., a T-bond) from the futures seller. Multiple Treasury bonds (based on maturity of the bond) are eligible for delivery when a Treasury futures contract matures. The CBOT lists the conversion factors for all eligible securities underlying the various Treasury futures contracts at its website (for example, www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/treasury-conversion-factors.html shows the securities are eligible for delivery for various Treasury futures contracts).

Traders in futures (as well as option) markets can be either speculators, hedgers, or arbitrageurs. Speculators in futures contracts buy to profit from a price increase or sell to profit from a price decrease. Speculators buy futures contracts with the hope of later being able to sell them at a higher price. Conversely, speculators sell futures contracts with the hope of being able to buy back identical and offsetting futures contracts at a lower price. Thus, speculators put their money at risk in the hope of profiting from an anticipated price change. Hedgers take a position in a futures contract as protection against an increase or decrease in the price of a security such as a bond or stock in the future. Hedgers buy a futures contract to lock in a price now to protect against future rising securities prices. Hedgers sell a futures contract to lock in a price now to protect against a future decline in securities prices. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, arbitrageurs seek to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies for the same asset by taking a long position in one market (i.e., the spot market) and simultaneously taking a short position in another market (i.e., the futures market) to make a risk-free profit when there is a mismatch between the two prices. The arbitrageur is neither speculating on market movements nor hedging market movements. Rather, he or she is betting on the mispricing of a security that occurs in related markets.

Profit and Loss on a Futures Transaction. In Table 10-4, a June 2020 Treasury bond futures contract could be bought (long) or sold (short) on March 13, 2020, for 176'15 (or 176.469) percent of the face value of the T-bond. The minimum contract size on one of these futures is 100,000, so a position in one contract can be taken at a price of 176,469.

The subsequent profit or loss from a position in June 2020 T-bonds taken on March 13, 2020, is graphically described in Figure 10-4. A long position in the futures

# initial margin

A deposit required on futures trades to ensure that the terms of any futures contract will be met.

# maintenance margin

The margin a futures trader must maintain once a futures position is taken. If losses on the customer's futures position occur and the level of the funds in the margin account drop below the maintenance margin, the customer is required to deposit additional funds into his or her margin account, bringing the balance back up to the initial margin.

# leveraged investment

An investment in which traders post and maintain only a small portion of the value of their futures position in their accounts. The vast majority of the investment is borrowed from the investor's broker.

market produces a profit when the value of the underlying T-bond increases (i.e., interest rates fall between March 13, 2020, and the June expiration). A short position in the futures will produce a profit when the value of the underlying T-bond decreases (i.e., interest rates rise). For example, if the T-bond futures price falls to 175.87 percent of the face value between March 13, 2020, and the June expiration, the long position incurs a loss of $599 [(176.469\% - 175.870\%) × $100,000], while the short position incurs a gain of 599.

Margin Requirements on Futures Contracts. Brokerage firms require their customers to post only a portion of the value of the futures (and option) contracts, called an initial margin, any time they request a trade. The amount of the margin varies according to the type of contract traded and the quantity of futures contracts traded (e.g., 5 percent of the value of the underlying asset). Minimum margin levels are set by each exchange. Margin requirements for futures options traded on the CME and CBOT can be found at www.cmegroup.com/clearing/margins/. If losses on the customer's futures position occur (when their account is marked to market at the end of the trading day) and the level of the funds in the margin account drops below a stated level (called the maintenance margin), the customer receives a margin call. A margin call requires the customer to deposit additional funds into his or her margin account, bringing the balance back up to the initial level. The maintenance margin is generally about 75 percent of the initial margin. If the margin is not maintained, the broker closes out (sells) the customer's futures position. Any amount of cash received above the initial margin may be withdrawn by the customer from his or her account. Brokerage firms are responsible for ensuring that their customers maintain the required margin requirements.

Because futures traders must post and maintain only a small portion of the value of their futures position in their accounts (e.g., 2 percent of the value of the contracts), these investments are highly leveraged (called leveraged investments). That is, the vast majority of the investment is "borrowed" from the investor's broker. This high degree of leverage, combined with the marking to market feature of these contracts, can require the payment of large, unexpected cash flows from the investor to the broker if the price of the futures contracts moves against the investor.

# EXAMPLE 10-1 The Impact of Marking to Market and Margin Requirements on Futures Investments

Suppose an investor has a 1 million long position in T-bond futures. The investor's broker requires a maintenance margin of 4 percent, or 40,000 (1m × 0.04), which is the amount currently in the investor's account. Suppose also that the value of the futures contracts drops by 50,000 to \$950,000. The investor will now be required to hold \$38,000 (950,000 × 0.04) in his account (or he has a 2,000 surplus). Further, because futures contracts are marked to market, the investor's broker will make a margin call to the investor requiring him to immediately send a check for 50,000 – \$2,000, or \$48,000, leaving him with an account balance of \$38,000 at his broker for the \$950,000 T-bond futures position.

If the next day the futures contract drops in value by another $40,000 to $910,000, the investor is now required to hold $36,400 ($910,000 × 0.40) in his account. He has \$1,600 surplus ($38,000 – $36,400). But, because futures contracts are marked to market, the investor's broker will make a margin call to the investor requiring him to immediately send a check for $40,000 – $1,600, or \$38,400, leaving him with an account balance of \$36,400 at his broker for the \$910,000 T-bond futures position.

If on day 3 the futures contract increases in value by $65,000, to $975,000, the investor is now required to hold $39,000 ($975,000 × 0.04) in his account. He has a \$2,600 deficit. Marking the account to market, to maintain the appropriate margin the investor may have his broker send him a check for $65,000 – $2,600, or \$62,400, leaving him with an account balance of \$39,000 at his broker for the \$975,000 T-bond futures position.

As this example illustrates, the marking to market feature of futures contracts can lead to unexpected cash outflows as well as cash inflows for a futures investor.

Chapters 23 and 24 provide more details on the use of futures contracts to manage interest rate and credit risk.

# OPTIONS

# option

A contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified price within a specified period of time.

# call option

An option that gives a purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security from the writer of the option at a prespecified exercise price on or before a prespecified date.

An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a prespecified price for a specified time period. Options are classified as either call options or put options. We discuss both of these below, highlighting their payoffs in terms of price movements on the underlying asset.

# Call Options

A call option gives the purchaser (or buyer) the right to buy an underlying security (e.g., a stock) at a prespecified price called the exercise or strike price  $(X)$ . In return, the buyer of the call option must pay the writer (or seller) an up-front fee known as a call premium  $(C)$ . This premium is an immediate negative cash flow for the buyer of the call option. However, he or she potentially stands to make a profit should the underlying stock's price be greater than the exercise price (by an amount exceeding the premium). If the price of the underlying stock is greater than  $X$  (the option is referred to as "in the money"), the buyer can exercise the option, buying the stock at  $X$  and selling it immediately in the stock market at the current market price, greater than  $X$ . If the price of the underlying stock is less than  $X$  (the option is referred to as "out of the money"), the buyer of the call would not exercise the option (i.e., buy the stock at  $X$  when its market value is less than  $X$ ). If this is the case when the option matures, the option expires unexercised. The same is true when the underlying stock price is exactly equal to  $X$  when the option expires (the option is referred to as "at the money"). The call buyer incurs a cost  $C$  (the call premium) for the option, and no other cash flows result.

Buying a Call Option. The profit or loss from buying a call option is illustrated in Figure 10-5. As Figure 10-5 shows, if, as the option expires, the price of the stock underlying the option is  $S$ , the buyer makes a profit of  $\pi$ , which is the difference between the stock's price ( $S, e.g.,$ 9.80) and the exercise price of the option ( $X, e.g.,$ 7.50) minus the call premium paid to the writer of the option ( $C, e.g.,$ 1.30). If the underlying stock's price is  $A$  (i.e.,  $\$8.80$ ) as the option expires, the buyer of the call has just broken even because the net proceeds from exercising the call ( $A - X =$ 8.80 -  $\$7.50 =$ 1.30) just equal the premium payment for the call ( $C, or\$ 1.30 in this case).

Figure 10-5 Payoff Function for the Buyer of a Call Option on a Stock

Notice two important things about call options in Figure 10-5:

1. As the underlying stock's price rises, the call option buyer has a large profit potential. The higher the underlying stock's price at expiration, the larger the profit on the exercise of the option, that is, if S = \$9.80, then π = $9.80 - $7.50 - \$1.30 = 1.00.
2. As the underlying stock's price falls, the call option buyer has a higher potential for losses, but they are limited to the call option premium. If the underlying stock's price at expiration is below the exercise price,  $X$ , the call buyer is not obligated to exercise the option. Thus, the buyer's losses are limited to the amount of the up-front premium payment ( $C$ , or 1.30 in this case) made to purchase the call option.

Thus, buying a call option is an appropriate position when the underlying asset's price is expected to rise.[10]

Writing a Call Option. The writer of a call option sells the option to the buyer (or is said to take a short position in the option). In writing a call option on a stock, the writer or seller receives an up-front fee or premium ( $C, e.g.,$ 1.30) and must stand ready to sell the underlying stock to the purchaser of the option at the exercise price,  $X$  (e.g.,  $\$7.50$ ). Note the payoff from writing a call option on a stock in Figure 10-6.

Notice two important things about this payoff function:

1. As the underlying stock's price falls, the potential for a call option writer to receive a positive payoff (or profit) increases. If the underlying stock's price is less than the exercise price (X) at expiration, the call option buyer will not exercise the option. The call option writer's profit has a maximum value equal to the call premium (C, or 1.30 in this case) charged up front to the buyer of the option.

Figure 10-6 Payoff Function for the Writer of a Call Option on a Stock

2. As the underlying stock's price rises, the call option writer has unlimited loss potential. If the underlying stock's price (S, e.g., \$9.80) is greater than the exercise price (X, e.g., \$7.50) at expiration, the call option buyer will exercise the option, forcing the option writer to buy the underlying stock at its high market price and then sell it to the call option buyer at the lower exercise price. That is, if S = \$9.80, then π = $1.30 - $9.80 + \$7.50 = -1.00. Since stock prices are theoretically unbounded in the upward direction, these losses could be very large.

Thus, writing a call option is an appropriate position when the underlying asset's price is expected to fall. Caution is warranted, however, because profits are limited but losses are potentially unlimited. A rise in the underlying stock's price to  $S$  results in the writer of the option losing  $\pi$  (in Figure 10-6).

# Put Options

# put option

An option that gives a purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security to the writer of the option at a prespecified price on or before a prespecified date.

A put option gives the option buyer the right to sell an underlying security (e.g., a stock) at a prespecified price to the writer of the put option. In return, the buyer of the put option must pay the writer (or seller) the put premium  $(P)$ . If the underlying stock's price is less than the exercise price  $(X)$  (the put option is "in the money"), the buyer will buy the underlying stock in the stock market at less than  $X$  and immediately sell it at  $X$  by exercising the put option. If the price of the underlying stock is greater than  $X$  (the put option is "out of the money"), the buyer of the put option would not exercise the option (i.e., selling the stock at  $X$  when its market value is more than  $X$ ). If this is the case when the option matures, the option expires unexercised. This is also true if the price of the underlying stock is exactly equal to  $X$  when the option expires (the put option is trading "at the money"). The put option buyer incurs a cost  $P$  for the option, and no other cash flows result.

Buying a Put Option. The buyer of a put option on a stock has the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying stock to the writer of the option at an agreed upon exercise price (X, e.g.,  \$9.00). In return for this option, the buyer of the put option pays a premium (P,\mathrm{e.g.},\$  0.65) to the option writer. We show the potential payoffs to the buyer of the put option in Figure 10-7. Note the following:

1. The lower the price of the underlying stock at the expiration of the option, the higher the profit to the put option buyer upon exercise. For example, if stock prices fall to D (= \$7.00) in Figure 10-7, the buyer of the put option can purchase the underlying stock in the stock market at D = \$7.00 and put it (sell it) back to the writer of the put option at the higher exercise price  X = \9.00 . As a result, after deducting the cost of the put premium,  P = \0.65 , the buyer makes a profit of  \pi p  ( = -\7.00 - \$0.65 + \$9.00 = \$1.35 ) in Figure 10-7.

2. As the underlying stock's price rises, the probability that the buyer of a put option has a negative payoff increases. If the underlying stock's price is greater than the exercise price (X = \$9.00) at expiration, the put option buyer will not exercise the option. As a result, his or her maximum loss is limited to the size of the up-front put premium (P = \$0.65 in this case) paid to the put option writer.

Thus, buying a put option is an appropriate position when the price on the underlying asset is expected to fall.

Writing a Put Option. The writer or seller of a put option receives a fee or premium  $(P, \text{e.g., $0.65})$  in return for standing ready to buy the underlying stock at the exercise price  $(X, \text{e.g., $9.00})$  should the buyer of the put choose to exercise the option. See the payoff function for writing a put option on a stock in Figure 10-8. Note the following:

1. When the underlying stock's price rises, the put option writer has an enhanced probability of making a profit. If the underlying stock's price is greater than the exercise price (X = \$9.00) at expiration, the put option buyer will not exercise the option. The put option writer's maximum profit, however, is constrained to equal the put premium (P, or \$0.65 in this case).
2. When the underlying stock's price falls, the writer of the put option is exposed to potentially large losses. If the price of the underlying stock is below the exercise price (e.g., D = \7.00\$ in Figure 10-8), the put option buyer will exercise the option, forcing the option writer to buy the underlying stock from the option buyer at the exercise price (X = \9.00\$ when it is worth only D = \7.00 in the stock market (i.e., if D = \7.00, then \pi p = \$0.65 - \$9.00 + \$7.00 = -\1.35)). The lower the stock's price at expiration relative to the exercise price, the greater the losses to the option writer.

Thus, writing a put option is an appropriate position if the price on the underlying asset is expected to rise. However, profits are limited and losses are potentially large.

Notice from the above discussion that an option holder has three ways to liquidate his or her position. First, if conditions are never profitable for an exercise (the option remains "out of the money"), the option holder can let the option expire unexercised. Second, the holder can take the opposite side of the transaction. Thus, an option buyer can sell options on the underlying asset with the same exercise price and the same expiration date. Third, the option holder can exercise the option, enforcing the terms of the option. An American option gives the option holder the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at any time before and on the

expiration date of the option. A European option (e.g., options on the S&P 500 Index) gives the option holder the right to buy or sell the underlying option only on the expiration date. Most options traded on exchanges in the United States and abroad are American options.

To understand the differences between futures versus options contracts, compare the profit and losses illustrated in Figure 10-4 (for a long position in futures contracts) with those in Figure 10-5 (for buying call option contracts). A long position in futures contracts produces both the potential for unlimited gains (if the underlying security increases in value) and unlimited losses (if the underlying security decreases in value). The larger the price change (up or down) on the underlying security, the larger the profit or loss for the futures investor. Further, the futures investor must eventually close out his/her position (either by liquidating the position before maturity or by holding the futures contract until maturity). Thus, the futures investor must take not only any gains that occur if the underlying security price increases, but any losses that may occur if the price of the underlying security falls. In comparison, the holder of a call option contract gains value if the price of the underlying security increases. However, if the underlying security falls in value, the call option holder is not obligated to take the losses. Because the option holder can let the option expire, the maximum loss the call option holder must take is the call option premium. Thus, like a long position in a futures contract, a call option allows the investor to gain when the value of the underlying security increases. However, unlike a futures contract, an option contract protects the investor against value losses when the price of the underlying security falls. The same is true when comparing a short position in a futures contract with a purchase of a put option.

# Option Values

The model most commonly used by practitioners and traders to price and value options is the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Black-Scholes model examines five factors that affect the price of an option:

1. The spot price of the underlying asset
2. The exercise price on the option
3. The option's exercise date
4. Price volatility of the underlying asset
5. The risk-free rate of interest

We show how to calculate an option's time value and, in turn, its overall value for any price of the underlying asset (at any point in time prior to maturity for a European option) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model in the appendix to this chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor). In the body of the text, we discuss these factors and the intuition behind their effect on an option's value.

# intrinsic value of an option

The difference between an option's exercise price and the underlying asset's price.

Notice in the discussion above that we examined the profit and loss from exercising an option at expiration. The profit and loss on an option was a function of the spot price of the option's underlying asset and the exercise price on the option. The difference between the underlying asset's spot price and an option's exercise price is called the option's intrinsic value. For a call option, the intrinsic value is:

Stock price - Exercise price if Stock price  $>$  Exercise price (option is in the money)

Zero if Stock price  $\leq$  Exercise price (option is out of or at the money)

For a put option, the intrinsic value is:

Exercise price - Stock price if Stock price  $<$  Exercise price (option is in the money)

Zero if Stock price  $\geq$  Exercise price (option is out of or at the money)

At expiration, an option's value is equal to its intrinsic value.

We limit the analysis of the profit and loss on an option to exercise at expiration because research has found that it is generally not optimal to exercise a European option (or American options on stocks that do not pay dividends) before its expiration date because of its potential "time value" (see below).[11] Specifically, exercising a call option prior to expiration is only appropriate if the value of the option before expiration is continuously less than its intrinsic value, which is rarely the case.

Figure 10-9 illustrates the time value effect for a call option. For example, suppose you have a call option on a stock with an exercise price of 50.00 and an expiration in three months. The underlying stock's price is currently 60.00. The intrinsic value of the option is 10 (60.00 - \$50.00). The option is currently selling on the Chicago Board of Trade for \$12.50. Thus, the value of the call option is greater than its intrinsic value by 2.50. The difference between an option's price (or premium) and its intrinsic value is called its time value. If you exercise the option today (prior to expiration), you receive the intrinsic value but give up the time value (which in this example is 2.50).

The time value of an option is the value associated with the probability that the intrinsic value could increase (if the underlying asset's price moves favorably) between the option's purchase and the option's expiration date. The time value of an option is a function of the price volatility of the underlying asset and the time until the option matures (its expiration date). As price volatility increases, the chance that the stock will go up or down in value increases. The owner of the call option benefits from price increases but

# time value of an option

has limited downside risk if the stock price decreases, since the loss of value of an option can never exceed the call premium. Thus, over any given period of time, the greater the price volatility of the underlying asset, the greater the chance the stock price will increase and the greater the time value of the option. Further, the greater the time to maturity, the greater (longer in time) the opportunity for the underlying stock price to increase; thus, the time value of the option increases.

It is this "time value" that allows an out-of-the-money option to have value and trade on the option markets. As noted above, a call option is out of the money if the exercise price is greater than the underlying stock's price, or the intrinsic value of the option is zero. This option still has "time" value and will trade at a positive price or premium if, however, investors believe that prior to the option's expiration, the stock price might increase (to a value greater than the exercise price). As an option moves toward expiration, its time value goes to zero. At any point in time, the time value of an option can be calculated by subtracting its intrinsic value (e.g.,  \$10.00) from its current market price or premium (e.g.,\$ 12.50).

The risk-free rate of interest affects the value of an option in a less than clear-cut way. All else constant, as the risk-free rate increases, the growth rate of the stock price increases. Recall from Chapter 2 that as the risk-free rate of interest increases, the required rate (and ultimately realized rate) of return increases on all investments. The result is greater stock price growth. However, the present value of any future cash flows received by the option holder decreases. For a call option, the first effect tends to increase the price of the option, while the second effect tends to decrease the price. It can be shown that the first effect always dominates the second effect. That is, the price of a call option always increases as the risk-free rate increases. Conversely, the two effects both tend to decrease the value of a put option. Thus, the price of a put option decreases as the risk-free rate increases.

# Option Markets

The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) opened in 1973. It was the first exchange devoted solely to the trading of stock options. In 1982, financial futures options contracts (options on financial futures contracts, e.g., Treasury bond futures contracts) started trading. Options markets have grown rapidly since the mid-1980s.

Figure 10-10 shows the notional value of option contracts held by commercial banks from 1992 through 2018. Table 10-5 lists some of the most active option contracts. The largest option exchange is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The first option exchanges abroad were the European Options Exchange and the London International Financial Futures Exchange (now the Euronext.liffe). Options exchanges have more recently been opened in Paris, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, and Japan. As with futures trading, many options also trade over the counter. Thus, the volume of trading in options is more than what is reported in the option quotes (see below) for the organized exchanges.

The trading process for options is similar to that for futures contracts. An investor desiring to take an option position calls his or her broker and places an order to buy or sell a stated number of call or put option contracts with a stated expiration date and exercise price. The broker directs this order to its representative on the appropriate exchange for execution. Most trading on the largest exchanges such as the CBOE takes place in trading pits, where traders for each delivery date on an option contract informally group together. Like futures contracts, options trading generally occurs using an open-outcry auction or electronic trading method.

Only option exchange members are allowed to transact on the floor of option exchanges. Trades from the public are placed with a floor broker, professional trader, or a market maker for the particular option being traded. Option trades may be placed as market orders (instructing the floor broker to transact at the best price available) or limit orders (instructing the floor broker to transact at a specified price).

upon in a trading pit, the two parties electronically send the details of the trade to the option clearinghouse (the Options Clearing Corporation), which breaks up trades into buy and sell transactions and takes the opposite side of each transaction—becoming the seller for every option contract buyer and the buyer for every option contract seller. The broker on the floor of the options exchange confirms the transaction with the investor's broker.

In the early 2000s, the CBOE increased the speed at which orders can be placed, executed, and filled by equipping floor brokers with handheld touch-screen computers that allow them to route and execute orders more easily and efficiently. For example, when a broker selects an order from the workstation, an electronic trading card appears on the handheld computer screen. The electronic card allows the broker to work the order and enter necessary trade information (e.g., volume, price, opposing market makers). When the card (details of the transaction) is complete, the broker can execute the trade with the touch of a finger. Once the broker has submitted the trade, the system simultaneously sends a "fill" report to the customer and instantaneously transmits these data to traders worldwide.

Table 10-6 shows portions of an option quote table for March 13, 2020. Three types of options trade: stock options, stock index options, and options on futures contracts. More "exotic" or special types of options (e.g., credit options—see Chapter 24) tend to trade over the counter rather than on organized exchanges. We discuss the three major types of exchange-traded options next.

Stock Options. The underlying asset on a stock option contract is the stock of a publicly traded company. One option generally involves 100 shares of the underlying company's stock. As mentioned earlier, options on U.S. option exchanges are American options. Look at the options quotes for ExxonMobil (XOM) in Table 10-6.

The second column lists the strike or exercise price on the different options on ExxonMobil stock (e.g.,  $37.00,$ 40.00, and \$42.50). Note that the same stock can have many different call and put options differentiated by expiration and strike price. Further, the quote gives an indication of whether the call and put options are trading in, out of, or at the money. For example, as shown in Figure 10-11, the ExxonMobil call option with an exercise price of  \$37.00 is trading in the money (\$ 37.00 is less than the current stock price, \$38.11), while the call options with an exercise price of  \$40.00 are trading out of the money (\$ 40.00 is greater than the current stock price, \$38.11). The exact opposite holds for the put options. That is, the put option with an exercise price of  \$37.00 is trading out of the money (\$ 37.00 is less than the current stock price, \$38.11), while the put options with an exercise price of  \$40.00 are trading in the money (\$ 40.00 is greater than the current stock price, \$38.11).

# EXAMPLE 10-2 Calculating Profits and Losses on a Stock Option

You have purchased a put option on Micron Tech common stock. The option has an exercise price of  \$14.00 and Micron Tech's stock currently trades at\$ 14.35. The option premium is 0.17 per contract.

Calculate your net profit on the option if Micron Tech's stock price falls to 13.25 and you exercise the option.

<table><tr><td>Purchase option:</td><td>-\$0.17 × 100 shares</td></tr><tr><td>Buy stock to exercise option:</td><td>- 13.25 × 100 shares</td></tr><tr><td>Sell stock by exercising option:</td><td>14.00 × 100 shares</td></tr><tr><td>Net profit</td><td>\$0.58 × 100 shares = 58</td></tr></table>

Calculate your net profit on the option if Micron Tech's stock price does not change over the life of the option.

<table><tr><td>Purchase option:</td><td>-\$0.17 × 100 shares</td></tr><tr><td>Net profit</td><td>-\$0.17 × 100 shares = -17</td></tr></table>

The option never moves into the money, so it would never be exercised.

Stock Index Options. The underlying asset on a stock index option is the value of a major stock market index (e.g., the DJIA or the S&P 500 Index—see Chapter 8). An investor buys a call (put) option on a stock index when he or she thinks the value of the underlying stock market index will rise (fall) by the expiration date of the option. If the index does indeed rise above (fall below) the exercise price on the option, the call (put) option holder profits by an amount equal to the intrinsic value when the option expires. A difference between a stock option and a stock index option is that at expiration, the stock index option holder cannot settle the option contract with the actual purchase or sale of the underlying stock index. Rather, at expiration, stock index options are settled in cash (i.e., the option holder receives the intrinsic value if the option is in the money and nothing if the option is out of the money). Most stock index options are American options, except for S&P 500 (SPX) and DJIA (DJX) options.

Options on stock indexes allow investors to invest indirectly in a diversified portfolio that replicates a major market index (e.g., the S&P 500 Index). If an investor thinks the S&P 500 Index will rise in the future, he or she can buy a call option on the S&P 500 Index. If the S&P 500 Index does rise, the value of the call option also rises. Thus, the investor can earn returns based directly on the S&P 500 Index without investing the large amounts of money needed to directly buy every stock in the index.

The contract size associated with each stock index option is established by a particular multiplier. For example, the multiplier on S&P 500 index option (SPX), S&P 100 index option (OEX), and DJIA index option (DJX) is  \$100. A multiplier of\$ 100 means that for each point by which a cash-settled option is in the money upon exercise, there is a \$100 increase in the cash settlement amount. Thus, if an S&P 500 index call option has an exercise price of 2,705.00 and the value of the S&P 500 index is 2,710.95, the dollar gain involved with the exercise of this call option is (2,710.95 - 2,705.00) × \$100 = 595.00.

Options on stock indexes also give investors a way to hedge their existing stock portfolios.

# EXAMPLE 10-3 Using a Stock Index Option to Hedge a Stock Portfolio

Suppose that over the last seven years an investor's stock portfolio increased in value from  $500,000 to$ 4.3 million. The stock portfolio was originally set up to (virtually) replicate the S&P 500 Index. The investor believes that due to expected rising interest rates in the next three months, stock market indexes (including the S&P 500 Index, currently at 2,700) will soon experience sharp declines in value and her stock portfolio will experience the same percentage drop in value. The investor has thought of liquidating her stock portfolio but is in the 20 percent capital gains tax bracket and does not want to incur such high tax payments.[14]

Instead, the investor takes a long position in (or buys) put options on the S&P 500 Index with a three-month expiration and an exercise price of 2,700. To hedge her  $4.3 million stock portfolio, the investor would buy 16 \left[ \frac{\$4.3 \text{ million}}{2,700 \times \$100} \right]$  put options on the S&P 500 Index.

Suppose the investor was correct in her expectations. In three months' time (as the put option on the S&P 500 Index expires), the S&P 500 Index has dropped 15 percent to 2,295, as has the value of her stock portfolio (now valued at  \$3.66 million). The investor has lost\$ 645,000 in value on her stock portfolio. However, the investor can settle the put options she purchased for cash—the intrinsic value at the option's expiration is \$648,000 [(2,700 - 2,295 per option) × \$100 × 16 options].

The investor was able to take a position in the stock index option market such that any losses on her stock portfolio were offset with gains on the put option position in stock index options. We ignored transaction costs in this example (i.e., the premiums required to purchase the 16 put options), but they would be small relative to the losses the investor would have incurred had she not hedged her stock portfolio with stock index options.

Stock index option quotes (in Table 10-6) list the underlying index and its closing value as of the quote date. The option (DJX) on Dow Jones Industrials index (DJIA) is based on 1/100th of the DJIA level (hence the closing value as of March 13, 2020, is 231.86, not 23,186.00). The first column lists the expiration date of the option contract and the second column lists the exercise price. Columns 3 through 5 provide information on call options. Column 3 lists the last reported sales price (or premium) from a previous business day on the option (e.g., 10.50 means the price of one March 20, 2020, call option with an exercise price of 225.00 is  $10.50 \times \$ 100 = \ $1,050\$ ). Column 4 is the trading volume (e.g.,  $0 =$  no call options traded), and Column 5 of the quote table reports the number of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the day (i.e., open interest). Columns 6 through 8 list the same type of information for put options traded.

Options on Futures Contracts. The underlying asset on a futures option is a futures contract (e.g., 100,000 Treasury bond futures—discussed above). The buyer of a call (put) option on a futures contract has the right to buy (sell) the underlying futures contract at or before expiration. The seller of a call (put) option on a futures contract creates the obligation to sell (buy) the underlying futures contract on exercise by the option buyer. If exercised, a call (put) option holder can buy (sell) the underlying futures contracts at the exercise price. Options on futures can be more attractive to investors than options on an underlying asset when it is cheaper or more convenient to deliver futures contracts on the asset rather than the actual asset. For example, trading options on T-bond futures contracts rather than options on T-bonds ensures that a highly liquid asset will be delivered and that problems associated with accrued interest and the determination of which long-term bond to deliver are avoided. Another advantage is that price information about futures contracts (the underlying asset on the option) is generally more readily available than price information on the T-bonds themselves (T-bond price information can be obtained only by surveying bond dealers). Options are currently written on interest rate, currency, and stock index futures contracts.

Look at the first interest rate futures option quote listed in Table 10-6 (for T-bonds). The quote first lists the underlying asset (e.g., on June 2020 30-Year Treasury Bond Future), and its prior settlement price. The contract unit is face value at maturity of 100,000, and the basis for the quote is 1/64ths. For example, last traded price of 5'45 means 5 + 45 / 64 = 5.70. Column 1 lists the expiration month; Column 2 lists the strike price; Columns 3 through 5 list last (or most recent) traded price, trading volume (total number of contract traded), and prior settlement price (final settlement price calculated at the end of the previous trading day) for call options on the underlying asset. Columns 6 through 8 list the same type of information for put options.

Credit Options. Options also have a potential use in hedging the credit risk of a financial institution. Compared to their use in hedging interest rate risk, options used to hedge credit risk are a relatively new phenomenon. Two alternative credit option derivatives exist to hedge credit risk on a balance sheet: credit spread call options and digital default options. A credit spread call option is a call option whose payoff increases as the (default) risk premium or yield spread on a specified benchmark bond of the borrower increases above some exercise spread. A financial institution concerned that the risk on a loan to that borrower will increase can purchase a credit spread call option to hedge its increased credit risk. A digital default option is an option that pays a stated amount in the event of a loan default (the extreme case of increased credit risk). In the event of a loan default, the option writer pays the financial institution the par value of the defaulted loans. If the loans are paid off in accordance with the loan agreement, however, the default option expires unexercised. As a result, the institution will suffer a maximum loss on the option equal to the premium (cost) of buying the default option from the writer (seller).

Chapter 24 provides more details on the use of option contracts to manage interest rate and credit risk.

# REGULATION OF FUTURES AND OPTIONS MARKETS

LG 10-6 www.cftc.gov

www.sec.gov

Derivative securities are subject to three levels of institutional regulation. First, regulators of derivatives specify "permissible activities" that institutions may engage in. Second, once permissible activities have been specified, institutions engaging in those activities are subjected to supervisory oversight. Third, regulators attempt to judge the overall integrity of each institution engaging in derivative activities by assessing the capital adequacy of the institutions and by enforcing regulations to ensure compliance with those capital requirements. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are often viewed as "functional" regulators. The SEC regulates all securities traded on national securities exchanges, including several exchange-traded derivatives. The SEC's regulation of derivatives includes price reporting requirements, antimipulation regulations, position limits, audit trail requirements, and margin requirements. The CFTC has exclusive jurisdiction over all exchange-traded

# LG 10-7 derivative securities. It therefore regulates all national futures exchanges, as well as all futures and options contracts. The CFTC's regulations include minimum capital requirements for traders, reporting and transparency requirements, antifraud and antimputation regulations, and minimum standards for clearinghouse organizations.

Since January 1, 2000, the main regulator of accounting standards (the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB) has required all FIs (and nonfinancial firms) to reflect the mark to market value of their derivative positions in their financial statements. This means that FIs must immediately recognize all gains and losses on such contracts and disclose those gains and losses to shareholders and regulators. Further, firms must show whether they are using derivatives to hedge risks connected to their business or whether they are just taking an open (risky) position.

The main bank regulators—the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Comptroller of the Currency—also have issued uniform guidelines for banks that trade in futures and forwards. These guidelines require a bank to (1) establish internal guidelines regarding its hedging activity, (2) establish trading limits, and (3) disclose large contract positions that materially affect bank risk to shareholders and outside investors. Overall, the policy of regulators is to encourage the use of futures for hedging and discourage their use for speculation, although on a practical basis it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. Further, as we will discuss in Chapter 13, exchange-traded derivative securities such as futures contracts are not subject to risk-based capital requirements. By contrast, OTC derivative securities such as forward contracts are potentially subject to capital requirements. Indeed, the growth of the derivative securities markets was one of the major factors underlying the imposition of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) risk-based capital requirements in January 1993 (see Chapter 13). The fear then was that in a long-term derivative security contract, an out-of-the-money counterparty—that is, a counterparty that is currently at a disadvantage in terms of cash flows—would have incentives to default on such contracts to deter current and future losses. Consequently, the BIS imposed a required capital ratio for depository institutions against their holdings of derivative securities. However, these capital requirements were not sufficient to insure the solvency of some FIs against the extreme losses experienced during the financial crisis.

Because of their lack of regulation and because of the significant negative role that overthe-counter (OTC) derivative securities played during the financial crisis, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 included a plan to regulate OTC derivatives. First, the plan called for most of the OTC derivatives to trade on regulated exchanges, which would guarantee trades and help cushion against potential defaults. This change would make it easier for participants to see the market prices of these securities and make the markets more transparent. Second, like exchange-traded derivatives, the previous OTC traded securities would now come under the authority of the SEC and the CFTC, while bank regulators would oversee the banks dealing in these derivatives. Thus, the changes result in OTC derivative securities being regulated in a similar fashion as exchange-traded securities. As of 2016, standards and requirements for the new trade reporting, central clearing, and platform trading rules are in force for over 90 percent of OTC transactions.

A swap is an agreement between two parties (called counterparties) to exchange specified periodic cash flows in the future based on some underlying instrument or price (e.g., a fixed or floating rate on a bond or note). Like forward, futures, and option contracts, swaps allow firms to better manage their interest rate, foreign exchange, and credit risks. However, swaps also can result in large losses. At the heart of the financial crisis in 2008-2009 were derivative securities, mainly credit swaps, held by financial institutions. Specifically, in the late 2000s, FIs such as Lehman Brothers and AIG had written and also (in the case of AIG) insured billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) contracts. When the mortgages underlying these contracts fell drastically in value, credit swap writers found themselves unable to make good on their promised payments to the swap holders. The result was a significant increase in risk and a decrease in profits for the FIs that had purchased these swap contracts. To prevent a massive collapse of the financial system, the federal government had to step in and bail out several of these FIs.

Swaps were first developed in 1981 when IBM and the World Bank entered into a currency swap agreement. At the time, IBM had large amounts of debt denominated in Swiss franc and German deutsche mark debt. Also during this period, borrowing rates were at record highs: the U.S. prime rate at the time was 18 percent, in West Germany the prime rate was 12 percent, and in Switzerland it was 8 percent. The World Bank was looking for the cheapest source of funding its lending programs, and the West German and Swiss governments limited the amount that the World Bank could borrow. Thus, IBM and the World Bank worked out an agreement in which the World Bank borrowed dollars in the U.S. market and swapped the dollar payment obligation with IBM in exchange for taking over IBM's Swiss franc and German deutsche mark obligations. Seeing the advantages of such agreements, the swap market grew quickly.

Figure 10-12 shows the growth in the notional value of swaps outstanding from 1992 through 2018. Of the  \$176.35 trillion derivatives contracts outstanding held by commercial banks in 2018, the notional value of swap contracts outstanding was\$ 97.92 trillion (more than half of all derivatives contracts). The five generic types of swaps are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, credit risk swaps, commodity swaps, and equity swaps.[15] The asset or instrument underlying the swap may change, but the basic principle of a swap agreement is the same in that it involves the transacting parties restructuring their asset or liability cash flows in a preferred direction. In this section, we consider the role of the two major generic types of swaps—interest rate and currency. We also discuss the fastest growing type of swap—credit swaps. We look at other types of swaps and describe the ability of swaps to hedge various kinds of risk in more detail in Chapter 24.

By far the largest segment of the swap market is comprised of interest rate swaps. Conceptually, an interest rate swap is a succession of forward contracts on interest rates

15. There are also swaptions, which are options to enter into a swap agreement at some preagreed contract terms (e.g., a fixed rate of 10 percent) at some time in the future in return for the payment of an up-front premium.

arranged by two parties.[16] As such, it allows the swap parties to put in place long-term protection (sometimes for as long as 15 years) against interest rate risk (see Chapter 23). The swap reduces the need to "roll over" contracts from old ones into new ones if futures or forward contracts had been relied on to achieve such long-term hedging protection.[17]

In a swap contract, the swap buyer agrees to make a number of fixed interest rate payments based on a principal contractual amount (called the notional principal) on periodic settlement dates to the swap seller. The swap seller, in turn, agrees to make floating-rate payments, tied to some interest rate, to the swap buyer on the same periodic settlement dates. In undertaking this transaction, the party that is the fixed-rate payer is seeking to transform the variable-rate nature of its liabilities into fixed-rate liabilities to better match the fixed returns earned on its assets. Meanwhile, the party that is the variable-rate payer seeks to turn its fixed-rate liabilities into variable-rate liabilities to better match the variable returns on its assets.

Hedging Interest Rate Risk with an Interest Rate Swap. To explain the role of a swap transaction in protecting a firm against interest rate risk, we use a simple example of an interest rate swap. Consider two financial institutions. The first is a money center bank that has raised 50 million of its funds by issuing five-year, medium-term notes with 6 percent annual fixed coupons (see Table 10-7). On the asset side of its portfolio, the bank makes commercial and industrial (C&I) loans whose rates are indexed to annual changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (say, LIBOR + 2\%). FIs index most large commercial and industrial loans to either LIBOR or the federal funds rate in the money market.

As a result of having floating-rate loans and fixed-rate liabilities in its asset-liability structure, the money center bank is exposed to interest rate risk. Specifically, if interest rates decrease, the bank's interest income decreases, since the variable interest return on loans (assets) will fall relative to the fixed cost of its funds (liabilities). On the balance sheet, the money center bank could attract an additional 50 million in short-term deposits that are indexed to the LIBOR rate (say, LIBOR plus 1.5 percent) in a manner similar to its loans. The proceeds of these deposits could then be used to pay off the medium-term notes. This on-balance-sheet change would eliminate the interest rate exposure of the bank. Alternatively, to protect the bank's income against this interest rate risk, the bank could go off the balance sheet and sell an interest rate swap—that is, enter into a swap agreement to make the floating-rate payment side of a swap agreement.

The second party to the swap in this example is a savings bank that has invested 50 million in fixed interest rate (at say 8.5 percent) residential mortgage assets of long maturity. To finance this residential mortgage portfolio, the savings bank uses short-term LIBOR deposits with an average duration of one year (see Table 10-7). On maturity, these must be "rolled over" at the current LIBOR rate. Consequently, the savings bank's asset-liability deposits balance sheet structure is the reverse of the money center bank's—if interest rates increase, the savings

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Panel A: Money Center Bank&#x27;s Balance Sheet (Swap Seller)</td></tr><tr><td>C&amp;I loans (rate indexed to LIBOR + 2\%) =</td><td>50m</td><td>Medium-term notes

16. For example, a four-year swap with annual swap dates involves four net cash flows between the parties to a swap. This is essentially similar to arranging four forward rate agreement (FRA) contracts: a one-year, a two-year, a three-year, and a four-year contract.
17. For example, futures contracts are offered usually with a maximum maturity of two years or less.

Figure 10-13 A Swap Transaction

Swap arranged by third-party intermediary (swap agent): bank's interest expense increases. Since its assets (mortgages) are fixed rate, while its liabilities (deposits) are floating, the savings bank's net income falls. On the balance sheet, the savings bank could issue long-term notes with a maturity equal or close to that on the mortgages (at, say, 7.5 percent). The proceeds of the sale of the notes could then be used to pay off the CDs and reduce the interest rate risk. Alternatively, the savings bank could hedge this interest rate risk exposure by going off the balance sheet and buying a swap—that is, the savings bank could enter into a swap agreement to make the fixed-rate payment side of a swap agreement.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/8d04a5ac-85cd-4263-9695-9d761733496f/601d96c8d2ab72c106c65aff1629d32ec4a4b73eb1be8d0e93aca5a5dbe16f5c.jpg)

The opposing balance sheet and interest rate risk exposures of the money center bank and the savings bank provide the necessary conditions for an interest rate swap agreement between the two parties. This swap agreement can be arranged directly by the two parties themselves—for example, by direct telephone contact. However, it is likely that a third financial institution or institutions—another commercial bank or an investment bank—would act either as a broker or an agent, receiving a fee for bringing the two parties together or intermediating fully by accepting the credit risk exposure and guaranteeing the cash flows underlying the swap contract. The intermediary stage of a swap can pass through many brokers, each taking a commission. We illustrate these swap transactions in Figure 10-13. By acting as a principal as well as an agent in arranging the swap, the third party financial institution can add a credit risk premium to the fee. However, the credit risk exposure of a swap to a financial institution is somewhat less than that on a loan (see Chapter 24). Conceptually, when a third-party financial institution fully intermediates the swap, that institution is really entering into two separate swap agreements—in this example, one with the money center bank and one with the savings bank.

# EXAMPLE 10-4 Expected Cash Flows on an Interest Rate Swap

For the two financial institutions, a swap agreement might dictate that the savings bank send fixed payments of 7 percent per year of the notional 50 million value of the swap to the money center bank, each year for 5 years, to allow the money center bank to cover fully the coupon interest payments on its note issue. In return, the money center bank could send annual payments indexed to the one-year LIBOR + 1 percent, for 5 years, to help the savings bank cover the cost of refinancing its one-year renewable LIBOR deposits.[18] We depict this fixed-floating rate swap transaction in Figure 10-14. The expected net financing costs for the FIs are listed in Table 10-8.

As a result of the swap, the money center bank has transformed its five-year, fixed-rate liability notes into a variable-rate liability matching the variability of returns on its C&I loans. Further, through the interest rate swap, the money center bank effectively pays LIBOR for its financing. Had it gone to the debt market, the money center bank would have paid LIBOR plus 1.5 percent (a savings of 1.5 percent with the swap). Further, the savings bank also has transformed its variable-rate LIBOR deposits into fixed-rate payments (of 6 percent) similar to those received on its fixed-rate mortgages. Had it gone to the debt market, the savings bank would have paid 7.5 percent (a savings of 1.5 percent).

In analyzing this swap, the parties also must consider the actual realized cash flows on the swap. Realized cash flows on the swap depend on the actual market rates (here, LIBOR) that materialize over the life of the swap contract.

# EXAMPLE 10-5 Realized Cash Flows on an Interest Rate Swap

Assume that the realized or actual path of interest rates (LIBOR) over the five-year life of the swap contract are as follows:

<table><tr><td>End of Year</td><td>LIBOR</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>6.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2.0</td></tr></table>

Given this actual path of LIBOR, the money center bank's variable payments to the savings bank were indexed to these rates by the formula (LIBOR + 1\%) × \$50 million. By contrast, the fixed annual payments the savings bank made to the money center bank were the same each year: 7 percent times \$50 million.

We summarize the actual or realized cash flows among the two parties over the five years in Table 10-9. The savings bank's net payments from the swap in years 1 and 2 are  \$0.25 million per year. The enhanced cash flow offsets the increased cost of refinancing its LIBOR deposits in a higher interest rate environment; that is, the savings bank is hedged against rising rates. By contrast, the money center bank makes net payments on the swap in years 3, 4, and 5 when rates fall; thus, it is hedged against falling rates. The positive cash flow from the swap offsets the decline in the variable returns on the money center bank's asset portfolio. Overall, the savings bank received a net dollar payment on the swap of\$ 5.0 million in nominal dollars and the money center bank made a net payment of \$5.0 million. However, as shown in Table 10-10, both FIs have completely insulated their net income against changes in interest rates. The money center bank receives income of LIBOR + 2 percent on its assets and pays LIBOR on its existing debt and the swap, or its net income is \$1 million each year.

# currency swap

A swap used to hedge against exchange rate risk from mismatched currencies on assets and liabilities.

# Currency Swaps

Interest rate swaps are long-term contracts that can be used to hedge interest rate risk exposure. This section considers a simple example of how currency swaps can be used to immunize or hedge against exchange rate risk when firms mismatch the currencies of their assets and liabilities.

Fixed-Fixed Currency Swaps. Consider a U.S. financial institution with all of its fixed-rate assets denominated in dollars. It is financing its 200 million asset portfolio with a 100 million issue of five-year, medium-term British pound notes that have a fixed annual coupon of 6 percent. By comparison, a financial institution in the United Kingdom has all its 100 million assets denominated in pounds. It is funding those assets with a 200 million issue of five-year, medium-term dollar notes with a fixed annual coupon of 6 percent.

These two financial institutions are exposed to opposing currency risks. The U.S. institution is exposed to the risk that the dollar will depreciate (decline in value) against the pound over the next five years, which would make it more costly to cover the annual coupon interest payments and the principal repayment on its pound-denominated note liabilities. On the other hand, the UK institution is exposed to the risk that the dollar will appreciate against the pound, making it more difficult to cover the dollar coupon and principal payments on its five-year, 200 million note liabilities.

These financial institutions can hedge their exposures off the balance sheet. Assume that the dollar/pound exchange rate is fixed at  \$2/£1. The UK and U.S. financial institutions would enter into a currency swap by which the UK institution sends annual payments in pounds to cover the coupon and principal repayments of the U.S. financial institution's pound note issue, and the U.S. financial institution sends annual dollar payments to the UK financial institution to cover the interest and principal payments on its dollar note issue.[19] We summarize this currency swap in Figure 10-15. As a result of the swap, the UK financial institution transforms its fixed-rate dollar liabilities into fixed-rate pound liabilities that better match the fixed-rate pound cash flows from its asset portfolio. Similarly, the U.S. financial institution transforms fixed-rate pound liabilities into fixed-rate dollar liabilities that better match the fixed-rate dollar cash flows on its asset portfolio. In undertaking this exchange of cash flows, the two parties normally agree on a fixed exchange rate for the cash flows at the beginning of the period. In this case, the fixed exchange rate is\$ 2/£1. Chapter 24 explains in more detail how swaps can be used to hedge currency risk.

Note in the previous example that should the exchange rate change from the rate agreed in the swap (2/£1), either one or the other side would be losing in the sense that a new swap might be entered into at a more favorable exchange rate to one party. Specifically, if the dollar were to appreciate against the pound over the life of the swap, the agreement would become more costly for the U.S. financial institution. If, however, the dollar depreciated, the UK financial institution would find the agreement increasingly costly over the swap's life.

# Credit Swaps

In recent years the fastest-growing types of swaps have been those developed to better allow financial institutions to hedge their credit risk, so-called credit swaps or credit default swaps. In 2000, commercial banks' total notional principal for outstanding credit derivative contracts was  \$426 billion. By March 2008, this amount had risen to\$ 16.44 trillion, before falling to  \$13.44 trillion in 2009 during the financial crisis. By the end of 2018 (as explained below), the notional principal of credit derivative contracts had fallen dramatically, to\$ 4.28 trillion. Of this 2018 amount, 3.72 trillion was credit swaps. Two types of credit swaps are total return swaps and pure credit swaps. A total return swap involves swapping an obligation to pay interest at a specified fixed or floating rate for payments

Figure 10-15 Fixed-Fixed Pound/Dollar Currency Swap

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/8d04a5ac-85cd-4263-9695-9d761733496f/2147278c969d86f03f167eceb8c51fc5d3978d6fd39b6976c39df7a68c628bc7.jpg)

19. In a currency swap, both principal and interest payments are usually included as part of the swap agreement. For interest rate swaps, it is usual to include only interest rate payments. The reason for this is that both principal and interest are exposed to foreign exchange risk.

representing the total return on a loan (interest and principal value changes) of a specified amount. While total return swaps can be used to hedge credit risk exposure, they contain an element of interest rate risk as well as credit risk. For example, if the base rate on the loan changes, the net cash flows on the total return swap also will change—even though the credit risks of the underlying loans have not changed.

To strip out the "interest rate"—sensitive element of total return swaps, an alternative swap has been developed called a pure credit swap. In this case, the financial institution lender will send (each swap period) a fixed fee or payment (like an insurance premium) to the counterparty. If the financial institution lender's loan or loans do not default, it will receive nothing back from the counterparty. However, if the loan or loans default, the counterparty will cover the default loss by making a default payment that is often equal to the par value of the original loan minus the secondary market value of the defaulted loan. Thus, a pure credit swap is like buying credit insurance and/or a multi-period credit option.

While commercial banks have been the main buyers of credit risk protection through credit swaps, insurance companies (such as AIG) have been the net sellers of credit risk protection. Thus, they have been more willing than banks to bear credit risk. The result is that the FI bearing the credit risk of a loan is often different from the FI that issued the loan. Credit swaps are important for two reasons. First, credit risk is still more likely to cause an FI to fail than either interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk. Second, credit swaps allow FIs to maintain long-term customer lending relationships without bearing the full credit risk exposure from those relationships. Credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps, allow FIs to separate the credit risk exposure from the lending process itself. That is, FIs can assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants, originate loans, fund loans, and even monitor and service loans without retaining exposure to loss from credit events, such as default or missed payments. This decoupling of the risk from the lending activity allows the market to efficiently transfer risk across counterparties. However, it also loosens the incentives to carefully perform each of the steps of the lending process. This loosening of incentives was an important factor leading to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, which witnessed the after-effects of poor loan underwriting, shoddy documentation and due diligence, failure to monitor borrower activity, and fraudulent activity on the part of both lenders and borrowers. Further, although the credit protection buyer hedges exposure to default risk, there is still counterparty credit risk in the event that the seller fails to perform its obligations under the terms of the contract (as was the concern in September 2008 with regard to AIG, an active credit default swap seller). We look at types of credit swaps and their use as hedges of credit risk in detail in Chapter 24.

# Swap Markets

Swap transactions are generally heterogeneous in terms of maturities, indexes used to determine payments, and timing of payments—there is no standardized contract. Swap dealers (generally an FI performing this brokerage activity) exist to serve the function of taking the opposite side of each transaction in order to keep the swap market liquid by locating or matching counterparties or, in many cases, taking one side of the swap themselves. In a direct swap between two counterparties, each party must find another party having a mirror image financing requirement—for example, a financial institution in need of swapping fixed-rate payments, made quarterly for the next 10 years, on  \$25 million in liabilities must find a counterparty in need of swapping\$ 25 million in floating-rate payments made quarterly for the next 10 years. Without swap dealers, the search costs of finding such counterparties to a swap can be significant.

A further advantage of swap dealers is that they generally guarantee swap payments over the life of the contract. If one of the counterparties defaults on a direct swap, the other counterparty is no longer adequately hedged against risk and may have to replace the www.federalreserve.gov

defaulted swap with a new swap at less favorable terms (replacement risk). By booking a swap with a swap dealer, a default by a counterparty will not affect the other counterparty. The swap dealer incurs any costs associated with the default ( the fee or spread charged by the swap dealer to each party in a swap incorporates this default risk).21 Commercial and investment banks have evolved as the major swap dealers, mainly because of their close ties to the financial markets and their specialized skills in assessing credit risk. Each swap market dealer manages a large "book" of swaps listing its swap positions. As a result, swap dealers can also diversify some of their risk exposure away.

In contrast to futures and options markets, swap markets were historically governed by very little regulation—there was no central governing body overseeing swap market operations. Because commercial banks were the major swap dealers, the swap markets were subject, indirectly, to regulations imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and other bank regulatory agencies charged with monitoring bank risk. For example, commercial banks must include swap risk exposure when calculating risk-based capital requirements (see Chapter 13). To the extent that swap activity was part of a bank's overall business, swap markets were monitored for abuses. However, despite their growing presence in the swap markets, investment banks and insurance companies were subject to few regulations on their swap dealings.

Because of the role credit swaps (and other derivative securities) played in the financial crisis, the call for stricter regulation over these securities was strong in late 2008 and early 2009. The early months of 2009 saw several fundamental changes to the way credit swaps and other over-the-counter derivative securities operate. First, the market saw the introduction of central clearinghouses; one for the United States and one for Europe. In the United States, central clearing operations (operated by InterContinental Exchange, or ICE) began in March 2009. Clearinghouses act as the central counterparty to both sides of a credit swap transaction and thus reduce counterparty risk to both buyers and sellers. Second, there was a trend toward the international standardization of credit swap contracts. Standardization prevents legal disputes in ambiguous cases where the swap payout is unclear. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 formalized these changes by calling for new rules to be implemented and calling for previously over-the-counter traded swaps to be traded through exchanges. As of 2016, the CFTC has completed most mandated rulemakings, establishing a regime of regulatory oversight for many new entities, including swap intermediaries known as "Swap Dealers" and "Major Swap Participants," as well as clearinghouses and trading platforms. The SEC is also well under way in regard to its rulemaking and implementation of requirements covering security-based swaps (SBSs). Under this new regime, sufficiently liquid and standardized derivatives transactions are required to be centrally cleared, and the most liquid of those are required to be executed on platforms. Some derivatives still fall into the category of over-the-counter, which means that their terms are privately negotiated between two parties, and some will also remain uncleared. These non-centrally cleared swaps will be subject to new margin requirements based on an international standard developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and International Organization of Securities Commissions.

In August 2013, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) uncovered evidence that several commercial and investment banks had manipulated a benchmark for interest rate derivatives, the ISDAfix. As a result, the FIs earned millions of dollars in trading profits at the expense of companies and pension funds. The CFTC investigation found recorded telephone calls and e-mails showing that swap traders at the banks instructed ICAP Plc brokers, a New Jersey-based interdealer broker, to buy or sell as many interest rate swaps as necessary to move the ISDAfix to a specified level. By manipulating the benchmark, the banks profited on individual derivatives trades they had with customers

seeking to hedge against moves in interest rates. Companies and pension and mutual funds, including Calpers, the largest U.S. pension fund, and Pimco, manager of the world's largest mutual fund, use the derivatives at the center of the ISDAfix probe to hedge against losses or to speculate on interest rate fluctuations. The actions are in direct violation of the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits market makers from intentionally influencing the orderly execution of transactions that determine settlement prices.

Chapter 24 provides more details on the use of swaps to manage interest rate and credit risk.

# CAPS, FLOORS, AND COLLARS

# LG 10-8

# cap

A call option on interest rates, often with multiple exercise dates.

# floor

A put option on interest rates, often with multiple exercise dates.

Caps, floors, and collars are derivative securities that have many uses, especially in helping an FI to hedge interest rate risk. Buying a cap means buying a call option or a succession of call options on interest rates.[22] In general, FIs purchase interest rate caps if they are exposed to losses when interest rates rise. Usually, this happens if FIs are funding assets with floating-rate liabilities such as notes indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (or some other floating cost of funds) and they have fixed-rate assets or they are net long in bonds. Specifically, if interest rates rise above a cap rate, which acts in a similar fashion to a strike price in an option contract, the seller of the cap—usually a bank—compensates the buyer—for example, another financial institution—in return for an up-front premium. Suppose that two firms enter a two-year cap agreement with a notional value of \$1 million. The cap rate is 10 percent and payments are settled once a year based on year-end interest rates. For the interest rate movements shown in Figure 10-16, the cap writer owes the cap buyer (11\% – 10\%) × \$1 million, or \$10,000, at the end of year 1, and (12\% – 10\%) × \$1 million, or 20,000, at the end of year 2. As a result, buying an interest rate cap is like buying insurance against an (excessive) increase in interest rates. A cap agreement can have one or many exercise dates.

Buying a floor is similar to buying a put option on interest rates. FIs purchase floors when they have fixed costs of debt and they have variable or floating rates (returns) on assets or they are net short in bonds. If interest rates fall below the floor rate, the seller of the floor compensates the buyer in return for an up-front premium. For example, suppose that two financial institutions enter a two-year floor agreement with a notional value

22. Note that a cap can be viewed as a call option on interest rates (as discussed here) or as a put option on bond prices, since rising interest rates mean falling bond prices. Similarly, a floor (discussed in the next paragraph) can be viewed as a put option on interest rates or a call option on bond prices. We follow market convention and discuss caps and floors as options on interest rates rather than on bond prices.

of 1 million. The floor rate is 8 percent, and payments are settled once a year based on year-end rates. For the interest rate movements shown in Figure 10-17, the floor writer owes the floor buyer (8\% - 7\%) \times1 million, or \$10,000, at the end of year 1, and (8\% - 6\%) \times1 million, or \$20,000, at the end of year 2. As with caps, floor agreements can have one or many exercise dates.

A collar occurs when a firm takes a simultaneous position in a cap and a floor (e.g., buying a cap and selling a floor). FIs purchase collars to finance cap or floor positions or when they are concerned about excessive interest rate volatility. The idea here is that the firm wants to hedge itself against rising rates but wants to finance the cost of the cap. One way to do this is to sell a floor and use the premiums earned on the floor to pay the premium on the purchased cap. For example, suppose that a financial institution enters into a two-year collar agreement with a notional value of 1 million. The floor rate is 8 percent and the cap rate is 10 percent. Payments are settled once a year based on year-end rates. For the interest rate movements shown in Figure 10-18, the collar buyer, the financial institution, gains (11\% - 10\%) \times1 million, or \$10,000, at the end of year 1. However, since the financial institution has written or sold a floor to another financial institution to finance the cap purchase, it pays (8\% - 7\%) \times1 million, or \$10,000, at the end of year 2.

Many firms invested in caps and collars in the mid-2000s in expectation that interest rates would decrease. For example, in 2007 Deutsche Bank arranged a 500 million collar for Dubai Islamic Bank, which wanted to hedge a large portfolio against interest rate increases with minimal costs.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

14. Which are the largest derivative securities markets globally?
15. In which currencies most global derivative securities are denominated?

544.38 trillion in 2018 compared to exchange traded contracts which totaled 94.85 trillion in 2018. In both markets, interest rate contracts dominated: 436.83 trillion in notional value in the OTC markets and 94.45 trillion on exchanges. Notice also the impact the financial crisis had on these worldwide markets. In June 2008, total OTC derivative contracts outstanding were 683.81 trillion and contracts traded on exchanges totaled \$84.29 trillion. These fell to \$547.98 trillion traded in the OTC markets and 57.72 trillion traded on exchanges in December 2008, at the height of the crisis and have remained at post-crisis levels till 2018.

U.S. markets and currencies dominate global derivative securities markets. On organized exchanges, North American markets traded  \$68.85 trillion of the\$ 94.85 trillion contracts traded in 2018. In the OTC markets,  \$80.19 trillion of the currency contracts,\$ 169.16 trillion of the interest rate contracts, and \$2.93 trillion of the equity-linked contracts were denominated in U.S. dollars. The euro and European derivative securities markets, however, are now a strong second behind, and in some areas actually exceed, the United States. In 2018 European exchange markets traded  \$22.90 trillion of the total\$ 94.85 trillion contracts. In the OTC markets,  \$28.30 trillion of the currency contracts,\$ 114.01 trillion of the interest rate contracts, and \$2.02 trillion of the equity-linked contracts were denominated in the euro or European currencies. In fact, for every year but 2001 and 2018, more interest rate contracts on the OTC were euro-denominated than U.S. dollar-denominated. Also, in each year more equity-linked contracts on the OTC were euro-denominated than U.S. dollar-denominated.

# SUMMARY

In this chapter, we introduced the major derivative securities and the markets in which they trade. Derivative securities (forwards, futures, options, and swaps) are securities whose value depends on the value of an underlying asset but whose payoff is not guaranteed with cash flows from these assets. Derivative securities can be used as investments on which a trader hopes to directly profit or as hedge instruments used to protect the trader against risk from another asset or liability held. We examined the characteristics of the various securities and the markets in which each trade. We look at how these securities are used by financial institutions to hedge various risks in Chapter 24.

b. Propose a swap that would result in each institution having the same type of asset and liability cash flows.

c. Show that this swap would be acceptable to both parties.

19. Consider the following two financial institutions:

Money Center Bank:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>C&amp;I loans
(CD rate + 4\%)</td><td>400m</td><td>Medium-term notes
(4-year, 8\%)</td><td>400m</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Savings Bank:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-rate mortgages
(4-year, 9.5\%)</td><td>400m</td><td>Short-term
CDs (1-year)</td><td>400m</td></tr></table>

Managers of the money center bank are concerned that interest rates may fall over the next four years, while managers of the savings bank are concerned that interest rates may rise over the next four years.

On the balance sheet, the money center bank could attract an additional 400 million in short-term deposits that are indexed to the CD rate (say, CD plus 2 percent) in a manner similar to its loans. The proceeds of these deposits can be used to pay off the medium-term notes. Alternatively, the bank could go off the balance sheet and sell an interest rate swap. On the balance sheet, the savings bank could issue long-term notes with a maturity equal or close to that on the mortgages (at, say, 9 percent). The proceeds of the sale of the notes can be used to pay off the CDs and reduce the interest rate risk. Alternatively, the savings bank could hedge this interest rate risk exposure by going off the balance sheet and buying a swap.

The two FIs enter a swap agreement such that the savings bank sends fixed payments of 8 percent per year of the notional 400 million value of the swap to the money center bank, each year for 4 years, to allow the money center bank to cover fully the coupon interest payments on its note issue. In return, the money center bank sends annual payments indexed to the one-year CD rate + 1 percent, for 5 years, to help the savings bank cover the cost of refinancing its one-year renewable LIBOR deposits. (LG 10-7) a. Calculate the gain over the market rates for the money center bank and the savings bank from the swap.

b. Assume that the realized or actual path of CD rates over the four-year life of the swap contract is as follows:

<table><tr><td>End of Year</td><td>CD Rate</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>8.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>7.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>6.0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4.5</td></tr></table>

Calculate the swap payments made by the money center bank and the savings bank over the four-year swap period.

c. Calculate the net income for the money center bank and the savings bank over the four-year swap period.

20. Consider the following two financial institutions:

Bank:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>C&amp;I loans
(T-bill + 4\%)</td><td>200m</td><td>Medium-term notes
(5-year, 9\% fixed)</td><td>200m</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Savings Association:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-rate mortgages
(5-year, 13\% fixed)</td><td>200m</td><td>Short-term CDs
(T-bill1 + 3\%)</td><td>200m</td></tr></table>

Managers of the bank are concerned that interest rates may fall over the next four years, while managers of the savings association are concerned that interest rates may rise over the next four years.

On the balance sheet, the bank could attract an additional 200 million in short-term deposits that are indexed to the T-bill rate (say, T-bill plus 2 \frac{1}{2} percent) in a manner similar to its loans. The proceeds of these deposits can be used to pay off the medium-term notes. Alternatively, the bank could go off the balance sheet and sell an interest rate swap. On the balance sheet, the savings association could issue long-term notes with a maturity equal or close to that on the mortgages (at, say, 11 percent). The proceeds of the sale of the notes can be used to pay off the CDs and reduce the interest rate risk. Alternatively, the savings association could hedge this interest rate risk exposure by going off the balance sheet and buying a swap.

The two FIs enter a swap agreement such that the savings association sends fixed payments of 10 percent per year of the notional 200 million value of the swap to the bank, each year for 5 years, to allow the bank to cover fully the coupon interest payments on its note issue. In return, the bank sends annual payments indexed to the one-year T-bill + 2 \frac{1}{4} percent, for 5 years, to help the savings association cover the cost of refinancing its one-year renewable T-bill deposits. (LG 10-7) a. Calculate the gain over the market rates for the bank and the savings association from the swap.

b. Assume that the realized or actual path of T-bill rates over the five-year life of the swap contract is as follows:

<table><tr><td>End of Year</td><td>CD Rate</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>4\%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

Calculate the swap payments made by the bank and the savings association over the five-year swap period.

c. Calculate the net income for the bank and the savings association over the four-year swap period.
