# COMMERCIAL BANKS AS A SECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INDUSTRY: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

The largest (in dollar value of assets) FI group is commercial banks, also called depository institutions because a significant proportion of their funds come from customer deposits. Savings institutions and credit unions (discussed in Chapter 14) are also depository institutions. Chapters 11 through Chapter 13 describe commercial banks, their financial statements, and the regulations that govern their operations. As we examine the structure of commercial banks and their financial statements, notice a distinguishing feature between them and nonfinancial firms illustrated in Figure 11-1. Specifically, commercial banks' major assets are loans (financial assets) and their major liabilities are deposits. Just the opposite is true for nonfinancial firms, whose deposits are listed as assets on their balance sheets and whose loans are listed as liabilities. In contrast to commercial banks, nonfinancial firms' major assets are nonfinancial (tangible) assets such as buildings and

Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 11-2, commercial banks provide loans to, and accept deposits from, nonfinancial firms (and individuals), while nonfinancial firms provide deposits to, and obtain loans from, commercial banks.

Figure 11-2 Interaction between Commercial Banks and Nonfinancial Firms

During the recent financial crisis, several nondepository financial institutions (e.g., investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and finance company GMAC) requested and were allowed to convert to bank holding companies. The change was recognition that their models of finance and investing had become too risky and the FIs needed the cushion of bank deposits that kept some of the bigger commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase relatively safe during the crisis. By becoming bank holding companies, the firms agreed to significantly tighter regulations and much closer supervision by bank examiners from government agencies rather than only the Securities and Exchange Commission. The new charters required the FIs to be subject to more disclosure, hold higher capital reserves, and take less risk. However, the new bank holding companies also gained access to the full array of the Federal Reserve lending facilities, something the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers did not have.

As we discussed in Chapter 1, depository institutions, and commercial banks in particular, perform several services that are essential to the efficient functioning of the financial markets in the United States. For example, because deposits are a significant component of the money supply, commercial banks play a key role in the transmission of monetary policy for the central bank to the rest of the economy. Further, commercial banks are special in that the efficiency with which they provide payment services directly benefits the economy. Finally, commercial banks offer maturity intermediation services to the economy. Specifically, by maturity mismatching, commercial banks can produce new types of contracts such as long-term mortgage loans to households while still raising funds with short-term liability contracts such as deposits. Because of the vital nature of the services they provide, commercial banks are regulated to protect against a disruption in the provision of these services and the cost this would impose on the economy and society at large. Our attention in this chapter focuses on (1) the size, structure, and composition of the commercial banking industry; (2) its balance sheets and recent trends; (3) the industry's recent performance; and (4) its regulators.

1. What the three categories of depository institutions are?
2. What distinguishes a commercial bank from nonfinancial firms?

Commercial banks represent the largest group of depository institutions measured by asset size. They perform functions similar to those of savings institutions and credit unions—they accept deposits (liabilities) and make loans (assets). As we discuss in more detail in Chapter 14, commercial banks are distinguishable from savings institutions and credit unions, however, in the size and composition of their loans and deposits. Specifically, while deposits are the major source of funding, commercial bank liabilities usually include several types of nondeposit sources of funds (such as subordinated notes and debentures). Moreover, their loans are broader in range, including consumer, commercial, international, and real estate loans. Commercial banks are regulated separately from savings institutions and credit unions. Within the banking industry, the structure and composition of assets and liabilities also vary significantly for banks of different asset sizes.

# BALANCE SHEETS AND RECENT TRENDS

Chapter 12 provides a detailed discussion of the financial statements (balance sheets and income statements) of commercial banks and how financial statements are used by regulators, stockholders, depositors, and creditors to evaluate bank performance. In this chapter, we present a brief introduction to the commercial bank industry balance sheets and their recent performance, highlighting trends in each.

LG 11-2

# Assets

Consider the aggregate balance sheet (in Table 11-1) and the percentage distributions (in Figure 11-3) for all U.S. commercial banks as of 2019. The majority of the assets held by commercial banks are loans. Net loans and leases amounted to  \$10,394.31 billion, or 55.7 percent of total assets, and fell into four broad classes: loans secured by real estate, commercial and industrial loans, loans to individuals, and other loans and leases.^{1}$  Bank premises and fixed assets, other real estate owned, intangible assets, and all other assets amounted to 4,269.40 billion, or 22.9 percent of total assets.

Investment securities consist of items such as interest-bearing deposits purchased from other FIs, federal funds sold to other banks, repurchase agreements (RPs or repos), U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal securities issued by states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, and other debt and equity securities. In 2019, the investment portfolio totaled  \$3,981.63 billion, or 21.4 percent of total assets. U.S. government securities such as U.S. Treasury bonds totaled\$ 631.77 billion, with other securities making up the remainder. Investment securities generate interest income for the bank and are also used for trading and liquidity management purposes. Many investment securities held by banks are highly liquid, have low default risk, and can usually be traded in secondary markets (see Chapter 12).

While loans are the main revenue-generating assets for banks, investment securities provide banks with liquidity. Unlike manufacturing companies, commercial banks and other financial institutions are exposed to high levels of liquidity risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when a financial institution's liability holders such as depositors demand cash for the financial claims they hold with the financial institution. Because of the extensive levels of deposits held by banks (see below), they must hold significant amounts of cash and investment securities to make sure they can meet the demand from their liability holders if and when they liquidate the claims they hold.

A major inference we can draw from this asset structure (and the importance of loans in this asset structure) is that the major risks faced by modern commercial bank managers are credit or default risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and, ultimately, insolvency risk

(see Chapters 20 through 25). Because commercial banks are highly leveraged and therefore hold little equity (see below) compared to total assets, even a relatively small amount of loan defaults can wipe out the equity of a bank, leaving it insolvent. Losses such as those due to defaults are charged off against the equity (stockholders' stake) in a bank. Additions to the reserve for loan and lease losses account (and, in turn, the expense account "provisions for losses on loans and leases") to meet expected defaults reduce retained earnings and, thus, reduce equity of the bank (see Chapter 12). Unexpected defaults (e.g., due to a sudden major recession) are meant to be written off against the remainder of the bank's equity (e.g., its retained earnings and funds raised from share offerings). We look at recent loan performance below. Loan sales and securitization—the packaging and selling of loans and other assets backed by loans or other securities issued by the FI—are mechanisms that FIs have used to hedge their credit risk exposure. In addition, loan sales and securitization have allowed FI asset portfolios to become more liquid and have provided an important source of fee income (with FIs acting as servicing agents for the assets sold). We look at these activities in detail in Chapter 25.

Loans and investment securities continue to be the primary assets of the banking industry. Commercial loans are relatively more important for the larger banks, while consumer loans, small business loans, and residential mortgages are more important for small banks. Each of these types of loans creates credit and, to varying extents, liquidity risks for the banks. The security portfolio normally is a source of liquidity and interest rate risk, especially with the increased use of various types of mortgage-backed securities and structured notes. In certain environments, each of these risks can create operational and performance problems for a bank. Figure 11-4 shows broad trends over the 1992-2019 period in the four principal earning asset areas of commercial banks: loans secured by real estate (which includes residential and nonresidential real estate loans, construction and development loans, farmland loans, etc.), commercial and industrial loans, loans to individuals (credit card loans, auto loans, etc.), and securities (U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities, and equity securities). Loans secured by real estate have consistently been the largest asset class for commercial banks over the 1992-2019 period. After peaking at 38 percent of assets in 2005 and 2006, real estate loans have been shrinking steadily from 2007 to 2014. The major reason for this has been the fact that a substantive share of 1-4 family mortgage origination and servicing migrated from banks to nonbanks following the financial crisis.

In 2016, the volume of 1-4 family mortgages originated by nonbanks surpassed the volume originated by banks. Nonbanks accounted for 52.5 percent of the volume of 1-4 family mortgages originated in 2017, up significantly from the financial crisis-era low of 23.5 percent in 2007. The strong resurgence of nonbanks in mortgage origination and servicing post-crisis has largely been attributed to litigation on crisis-era legacy portfolios at the largest banks and more aggressive expansion by nonbanks. As for the proportion of commercial and industrial loans in the banks' asset portfolio, it has been declining since 2000 as well. This is largely because nonfinancial corporations are using debt securities more and bank loans less. From the end of 2008 to first quarter of 2019, nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding grew by 91 percent in nominal terms. Corporate bonds were especially appealing to corporate borrowers during the prolonged post-crisis period of low interest rates.

# Liabilities

LG 11-3

# transaction accounts

The sum of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing checking accounts.

# NOW account

An interest-bearing checking account.

# negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs)

Fixed-maturity interest-bearing deposits with face values of 100,000 or more that can be resold in the secondary market.

Commercial banks have two major sources of funds (other than the equity provided by owners and stockholders): (1) deposits and (2) borrowed or other liability funds. As noted previously, a major difference between banks and other firms is their high leverage or debt-to-assets ratio. For example, banks had an average ratio of equity to assets of 11.3 percent in 2019; this implies that 88.7 percent of assets were funded by debt, either deposits or borrowed funds.

Note that in Table 11-1, which shows the aggregate balance sheet of U.S. banks, in 2019, deposits amounted to  \$14,535.28 billion (78.0 percent of total assets) and subordinated debt and all other liabilities were\$ 69.95 and \$1,926.13 billion (0.4 percent and 10.3 percent of total assets), respectively. Of the total stock of deposits, transaction accounts represented 21.7 percent of total deposits (and 17.0 percent of total assets), or \$3,160.95 billion. Transaction accounts are checkable deposits that are either demand deposits or NOW accounts (negotiable order of withdrawal accounts). Since their introduction in 1980, NOW accounts have dominated the transaction accounts of banks. Nevertheless, since limitations are imposed on the ability of corporations to hold such accounts, demand deposits are still held. NOW accounts may be held only by individuals, sole proprietorships, nonprofit organizations, governmental units, and pension funds. Historically, demand deposits were prohibited from paying interest. Thus, businesses could not earn interest on their bank demand deposits. However, as of July 2011, the federal prohibition against the payment of interest on demand deposits, including business checking accounts, was repealed.

The second major segment of deposits is retail or household savings and time deposits, normally individual account holdings of less than 100,000. Important components of bank retail savings accounts are small nontransaction accounts, which include passbook savings accounts and retail time deposits. Small nontransaction accounts compose 55.2 percent of total deposits (and 43.0 percent of total assets). However, this disguises an important trend in the supply of these deposits to banks. Specifically, the amount held of retail savings and time deposits has been falling in recent years, largely as a result of competition from money market mutual funds. These funds pay a competitive rate of interest based on wholesale money market rates by pooling and investing funds (see Chapter 17) while requiring relatively small-denomination investments.

The third major segment of deposit funds is large time deposits ( \$100,000 or more);[2] these deposits amounted to\$ 2,042.09 billion, or approximately 14.0 percent of total deposits (and 11.0 percent of total assets) in 2019. These are primarily negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) (deposit claims with promised interest rates and fixed maturities of at least

14 days) that can be resold to outside investors in an organized secondary market. As such, they are usually distinguished from retail time deposits by their negotiability and secondary market liquidity.

Nondeposit liabilities comprise borrowings and other liabilities that total 10.7 percent of total assets, or 1,996.08 billion. These categories include a broad array of instruments, such as purchases of federal funds (bank reserves) on the interbank market and repurchase agreements (temporary swaps of securities for federal funds) at the short end of the maturity spectrum, to the issuance of notes and bonds at the longer end (see Chapters 5 and 6). We discuss commercial banks' use of each of these in Chapter 12.

Overall, the liability structure of banks' balance sheets tends to reflect a shorter maturity structure than that of their asset portfolio. Further, relatively more liquid instruments such as deposits and interbank borrowings are used to fund relatively less liquid assets such as loans. Thus, interest rate risk—or maturity mismatch risk—and liquidity risk are key exposure concerns for bank managers (see Chapters 20 through 25).

# Equity

Commercial bank equity capital (11.3 percent of total liabilities and equity in 2019) consists mainly of common and preferred stock (listed at par value), surplus or additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings. Regulators require banks to hold a minimum level of equity capital to act as a buffer against losses from their onand off-balance-sheet activities (see Chapter 13). Because of the relatively low cost of deposit funding, banks tend to hold equity close to the minimum levels set by regulators. As we discuss in Chapters 13 and 23, this impacts banks' exposure to risk and their ability to grow—both on and off the balance sheet—over time.

Part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008-2009 was the Capital Purchase Program, which was intended to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. Under the program, the Treasury purchased over  \$200 billion of senior preferred equity. The senior preferred shares rank senior to common stock should the bank be closed. In addition to capital injections received as part of the Capital Purchase Program, TARP provided additional emergency funding to Citigroup (\$ 25 billion) and Bank of America (\$20 billion). Through February 28, 2019, \$313 billion of TARP capital injections had been allocated to depository institutions (DIs), of which \$295 billion had been paid back, and \$19 billion had been written off.

As part of the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the largest banks are subject to annual stress tests, designed to ensure that the banks are properly capitalized. Scenarios used as part of the stress tests range from mild to calamitous, with the most extreme including a 5 percent decline in gross domestic product, an unemployment rate of 12 percent, and a volatile stock market that loses half its value. The original stress test was announced in late February 2009 when the Obama administration announced that it would conduct a "stress test" of the 19 largest U.S. DIs, which would measure the ability of these DIs to withstand a protracted economic slump (an unemployment rate above 10 percent and home prices dropping another 25 percent). Results of the stress test showed that 10 of the 19 DIs needed to raise a total of  \$74.6 billion in capital. Within a month of the May 7, 2009, release of the results, the DIs had raised\$ 149.45 billion of capital. As part of the 2019 stress tests, the severely adverse scenario includes a severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in commercial real estate markets and corporate debt markets. In this scenario, the unemployment rate increases to 10 percent, the level of real GDP falls 8 percent, housing prices decline 25 percent, the annualized rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) rises to 2 percent, equity prices fall approximately 50 percent, and equity market volatility increases sharply. The results of 2019 stress tests suggested that, in the aggregate, 18 firms would

# The TARP Program

In the wake of Lehman Brothers's bankruptcy, the U.S. Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) of 2008 to "restore the liquidity and stability to the financial system." The act authorized the Treasury Department to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and to spend up to  \$700 billion to "bail out" the U.S. financial system. In the original plan presented by then-secretary of the treasury Henry Paulson, the government would use TARP funds to buy distressed assets in financial institutions. On October 14, 2008, Paulson announced a revision in TARP implementation in which the Treasury directly injected\$ 250 billion of TARP funds (through the Capital Purchase Program [CPP]) into the U.S. banking system through the purchase of senior preferred stock and warrants in qualifying financial institutions (QFIs). The first \$125 billion was to be invested in nine large, systemically important bank holding companies. The remaining \$125 billion was to be made available for other banks. The amount of CPP capital that a QFI could apply for was restricted to between 1 percent and 3 percent of the QFI's risk-weighted assets. The Treasury was paid a 5 percent dividend on the preferred stock in the first five years and a 9 percent dividend thereafter. Over 700 of the approximate 8,300 depository institutions were accepted into CPP, receiving \$245 billion in capital infusions. The largest investment was \$25 billion and the smallest was 301,000.

To apply for CPP investments, banks were asked to submit their applications to their primary federal regulator: the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), or the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Based on recommendations from federal banking regulators, the Treasury made the final decision on whether or not to make the capital purchase. Many institutions decided to apply, while others opted out. Some were asked by federal regulators not to apply. A large number of banks withdrew their applications. However, because the Treasury did not release details of the applicant list to the public, it is not known how many banks withdrew their TARP applications voluntarily despite being qualified and how many withdrew because they did not meet the requirements and were encouraged to withdraw by the banking regulators. The application period for publicly held financial institutions to participate in CPP closed on November 14, 2008. The final investment under the CPP was made in December 2009.

To encourage banks to participate in CPP, the Treasury made the terms of CPP investments quite attractive. In the first nine CPP transactions, the Treasury paid  \$125 billion for financial claims worth only$ 89–$112 billion (these banks held over half of the banking industry's assets). The Congressional Oversight Panel issued an evaluation report on February 6, 2009, concluding that "[fors] all capital purchases made in 2008 under TARP, the Treasury paid \$254 billion, for which it received assets worth approximately \$176 billion, a shortfall of \$78 billion."

The attractive terms of CPP induced thousands of applicants, among which only about 700 financial institutions received any TARP funds.

The Capital Purchase Program is often characterized as a program for "big banks." Indeed,  \$163.5 billion of all CPP funds were allotted to the largest 19 banks. Further, many believe that small institutions were not able to and did not participate in the program. In fact, because of financial obligations associated with CPP, federal regulators did not initially allow temporarily unhealthy community banks to participate in CPP because such institutions would risk the Treasury's investment. However, on May 13, 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced that the Treasury would reopen the application window for participation in the CPP to banks with total assets under\$ 500 million and increase the amount that could be invested from 3 percent of risk-weighted assets to 5 percent of risk-weighted assets. In the end, smaller financial institutions made up the vast majority of participants in the CPP. By the time it closed on December 31, 2009, of the 707 applications approved and funded by the Treasury through the CPP, over half were institutions with less than 500 million in assets.

As the TARP CPP program progressed, many, particularly healthy, banks realized that the costs of participating in TARP were higher than had been expected. As public outrage swelled over the rapidly growing cost of "bailing out" financial institutions, the Obama administration and lawmakers attached more and more restrictions on banks that continued

received TARP funds. For example, with the acceptance of TARP funds, banks were told to put off evictions and modify mortgages for distressed homeowners, let shareholders vote on executive pay packages, slash dividends, and withdraw job offers to foreign citizens. Some bankers stated that conditions of the TARP program had become so onerous that they wanted to return the bailout money as soon as regulators set up a process to accept the repayments. For example, just three months after receiving TARP funds, Signature Bank of New York announced that because of new executive pay restrictions assessed as a part of the acceptance of TARP funds, it notified the Treasury that it intended to return the 120 million it had received. As a result, many banks, particularly those that were sufficiently

healthy, repaid their TARP funds quickly.

As of February 2019, banks have repaid  \$295 billion through principal and interest payments—representing a\$ 9 billion positive return to taxpayers so far. In late 2008 few would have predicted that TARP would end up with a profit.

# Off-Balance-Sheet Activities

The balance sheet itself does not reflect the total scope of bank activities. Banks conduct many fee-related activities off the balance sheet. Off-balance-sheet (OBS) activities are becoming increasingly important, in terms of their dollar value and the income they generate for banks—especially as the ability of banks to attract high-quality loan applicants and deposits becomes ever more difficult. OBS activities include issuing various types of guarantees (such as letters of credit), which often have a strong insurance underwriting element, and making future commitments to lend. Both services generate additional fee income for banks. Off-balance-sheet activities also involve engaging in derivative transactions—futures, forwards, options, and swaps.

# off-balance-sheet (OBS) asset

When an event occurs, this item moves onto the asset side of the balance sheet or income is realized on the income statement.

# off-balance-sheet (OBS) liability

When an event occurs, this item moves onto the liability side of the balance sheet or an expense is realized on the income statement.

Under current accounting standards, such activities are not shown on the current balance sheet. Rather, an item or activity is an off-balance-sheet (OBS) asset if, when a contingent event occurs, the item or activity moves onto the asset side of the balance sheet or an income item is realized on the income statement. Conversely, an item or activity is an off-balance-sheet (OBS) liability if, when a contingent event occurs, the item or activity moves onto the liability side of the balance sheet or an expense item is realized on the income statement.

By undertaking off-balance-sheet activities, banks hope to earn additional fee income to complement declining margins or spreads on their traditional lending business. At the same time, they can avoid regulatory costs or "taxes" since reserve requirements and deposit insurance premiums are not levied on off-balance-sheet activities (see Chapter 13). Thus, banks have both earnings and regulatory "tax-avoidance" incentives to undertake activities off their balance sheets.

Off-balance-sheet activities, however, can involve risks that add to the overall insolvency exposure of a financial institution (FI). Indeed, at the very heart of the financial crisis were losses associated with off-balance-sheet mortgage-backed securities created and held by FIs. These losses resulted in the failure, acquisition, or bailout of some of the largest FIs and a near meltdown of the world's financial and economic systems. Thus, off-balance-sheet activities and instruments have risk-reducing as well as risk-increasing attributes, and, when used appropriately, they can reduce or hedge an FI's interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks.

We show the notional, or face, value of bank OBS activities and their distribution and growth for 1992 to 2019 in Table 11-2. Notice the relative growth in the notional dollar value of OBS activities in Table 11-2. The notional value of OBS activities at commercial banks was  \$10,252.8 billion in 1992 compared to\$ 4,593.0 billion of on-balance-sheet activities. By 2010, the notional value of OBS bank activities was  \$254,731.5 billion (compared to the\$ 13,254.2 billion value of on-balance-sheet activities) before falling to 180,421.6 billion in 2019. It should be noted that the notional or face value of OBS activities does not accurately reflect the risk to the bank undertaking such activities. The potential for the bank to gain or lose on the contract is based on the possible change in the market value of the contract over the life of the contract rather than the notional or face value of the contract, normally less than 3 percent of the notional value of an OBS contract.

The use of derivative contracts accelerated during the 1992-2010 period and accounted for much of the growth in OBS activity. As we discuss in detail in Chapter 24, the significant growth in derivative securities activities by commercial banks has been a direct response to the increased interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign exchange risk exposures they have faced, both domestically and internationally. In particular, these contracts offer banks a way to hedge these risks without having to make extensive changes on the balance sheet. However, these assets and liabilities also introduce unique risks that must be managed. During the recent financial crisis, as mortgage borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, financial institutions that held these "toxic" mortgages and "toxic" credit derivatives (in the form of mortgage-backed securities) started announcing huge losses on them. Losses from the falling value of OBS securities reached over 1 trillion worldwide through 2009.

TARP gave the U.S. Treasury funds to buy "toxic" mortgages and other securities from financial institutions. However, the TARP plan was slow to be instituted and not all FIs chose to participate in the program. Better capitalized FIs wanted to hold on to their troubled OBS securities rather than sell them and record losses. Despite this, investors impounded the values of these toxic securities into the market prices of FIs that held them. As a result, early 2009 saw a plunge in the market values of financial institutions. Banks such as Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase traded at less than book value as investors had little confidence in the value of their assets. As a result, a new plan, announced on February 10, 2009, involved a number of initiatives, including offering federal insurance to banks against losses on bad assets. In addition, the Treasury, working with the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and private investors, created the Public-Private Investment Fund (PPIF) to acquire real estate-related OBS assets. By selling to PPIF, financial institutions could reduce balance sheet risk, support new lending, and help improve overall market functioning. The PPIF facility was initially funded at  \$500 billion with plans to expand the program to up to\$ 1.25 trillion over time. After several months of discussion, in July 2009, the government had selected nine financial firms to manage a scaled-down program, investing \$30 billion to start the fund. The selected firms had 12 weeks to raise \$500 million of capital each from private investors willing to invest in FIs' toxic assets. The total investment would be matched by the federal government. The purchase of 1.25 trillion in OBS mortgage-backed securities was completed in March 2010.

Although the simple notional dollar value of OBS items overestimates their risk exposure amounts, the increase in these activities between 1992 and 2010 was still nothing short of phenomenal. Indeed, this phenomenal increase and the potential for losses from them pushed regulators into imposing capital requirements on such activities and into explicitly recognizing an FI's solvency risk exposure from pursuing such activities. We describe these capital requirements in Chapter 13. Further, as a result of the role derivatives played in the financial crisis, the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has called for a revamping of the U.S. financial regulatory system that includes extending regulatory oversight to unregulated OTC derivative securities. The regulation requires that all over-the-counter derivatives contracts be subject to regulation, and that all derivatives dealers be subject to supervision. It also empowers regulators to enforce rules against manipulation and abuse. Additionally, part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is the Volcker Rule which prohibits U.S. depository institutions (DIs) from engaging in proprietary trading (i.e., trading as a principal for the trading account of the bank). Proprietary trading of bank holding company capital is banned in the bank and all subsidiaries, including investment banks. This includes any transaction to purchase or sell derivatives (hedging is allowed under certain restrictions). Nonproprietary trading (i.e., of client's money) is permitted anywhere in the bank holding company. The Volcker Rule was implemented in April 2014 and banks had until July 21, 2015, to be in compliance. The result has been a reduction in derivative securities held off-balance-sheet by these financial institutions and a reduction in overall OBS activities to 180,421.6 billion by 2019.

4. What the major sources of funding for commercial banks are?
5. What OBS assets and liabilities are?
6. What other types of fee-generating activities banks participate in?

# Other Fee-Generating Activities

Commercial banks engage in other fee-generating activities that cannot be easily identified from analyzing their onand off-balance-sheet accounts. Two of these include trust services and correspondent banking.

Trust Services. The trust department of a commercial bank holds and manages assets for individuals or corporations. Only the largest banks have sufficient staff to offer trust services. Individual trusts represent about one-half of all trust assets managed by commercial banks. These trusts include estate assets and assets delegated to bank trust departments by less financially sophisticated investors. Pension fund assets are the second largest group of assets managed by the trust departments of commercial banks. The banks manage the pension funds, act as trustees for any bonds held by the pension funds, and act as a transfer and disbursement agent for the pension funds. We discuss pension funds in more detail in Chapter 18.

Correspondent Banking. Correspondent banking is the provision of banking services to other banks that do not have the staff resources to perform the services themselves. These services include check clearing and collection, foreign exchange trading, hedging services, and participation in large loan and security issuances. Correspondent banking services are generally sold as a package of services. Payment for the services is generally in the form of non-interest-bearing deposits held at the bank offering the correspondent services (see Chapter 12).

# SIZE, STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITION OF THE INDUSTRY

# LG 11-5

As of 2019, the United States had 5,177 commercial banks. Even though this may seem to be a large number, in fact the number of banks has been decreasing. For example, in 1984, the number of banks was 14,483. Figure 11-5 illustrates the number of bank mergers, bank failures, and new charters for the period 1984 though 2019. Notice that much of the change in the size, structure, and composition of this industry is the result of mergers and acquisitions. As we discuss in Chapter 13, strict regulations imposed on commercial banks over much of the last century limited geographical diversification opportunities. As a result, commercial bank operational areas were often narrow (and specialized) and the number of commercial banks was large. It was not until the 1980s and 1990s that regulators (such as the Federal Reserve or state banking authorities) allowed banks to merge with other banks across state lines (interstate mergers), and it has only been since 1994 that Congress has passed legislation (the Reigle-Neal Act) easing branching by banks across state lines. Finally, it has only been since 1987 that banks have possessed powers to underwrite corporate securities. (Full authority to enter the investment banking [and insurance] business was received only with the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999.) We discuss the impact that changing regulations have had on the ability of commercial banks to merge and branch in Chapter 13.

These changes were not all one way. In mid-2005, Walmart filed an application with the FDIC to open a Utah-based "nonbank" bank,[4] stating that it wanted to use the bank to reduce the costs of processing electronic payments. Target, the retail chain, made a similar banking license application stating that it would use the "bank" to issue business credit cards. Target's application was approved in 2005. However, Walmart's application led to an unprecedented wave of opposition from regulators, the banking industry, and others, leading to the FDIC holding its first public hearings on an application. In July 2006, the FDIC declared a six-month moratorium on approving any new ILC licenses, saying it wanted to provide time to assess developments in the sector, including any need to improve regulatory oversight. In October 2006, a bill was introduced before the U.S. Congress that would keep Walmart and other retailers out of the banking sector. Specifically, the bill would prohibit nonfinancial firms from owning industrial banks or ILCs, thus barring Walmart from obtaining ILC charters. At the end of 2006, the FDIC was considering an extension of its moratorium, a move that would give Congress time to move forward with the bill. However, in March 2007, Walmart announced that it was withdrawing its application to open a bank. After Walmart's failed bid, ILC applications cooled down considerably. Between 2009 and 2017, the FDIC did not receive a single application for an ILC charter.

# shadow banking

Activities of nonfinancial services firms that perform banking services.

More recently, activities of nonfinancial service firms that perform banking services have been termed shadow banking. In the shadow banking system, savers place their funds with money market mutual and similar funds, which invest these funds in the liabilities of shadow banks. Borrowers get loans and leases from shadow banks rather than from banks. Like the traditional banking system, the shadow banking system intermediates the flow of funds between net savers and net borrowers. However, instead of the bank serving as the intermediary, it is the nonbank financial service firm, or shadow bank, that intermediates. Further, unlike the traditional banking system, where the complete credit intermediation is performed by a single bank, in the shadow banking system it is performed through a series of steps involving many nonbank financial service firms. Finally, shadow banks face significantly reduced regulation than traditional banks.

Because of the specialized nature involved in the credit intermediation process performed by shadow banks, these nonbank financial service firms can often perform the process more cost efficiently than traditional banks. Further, because of the lower costs and lack of regulatory controls, shadow banks can take on risks that traditional banks either cannot or are unwilling to take. Thus, the shadow banking system allows credit to be available that might not otherwise be generated through the traditional banking system. The 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act called for regulators to be given broad authority to monitor and regulate nonbank financial firms that pose risks to the

# Bank Size and Concentration

Interestingly, a comparison of asset concentration by bank size (see Figure 11-6) indicates that the recent consolidation in banking appears to have reduced the asset share of the smallest banks (under  \$1 billion) from 36.6 percent in 1984 to 6.2 percent in 2019. These small or community banks—with less than\$ 1 billion in asset size—tend to specialize in retail banking, or consumer banking, such as providing residential mortgages and consumer loans and accessing the local deposit base. Clearly, this group of banks is decreasing both in number and importance.

The relative asset share of the largest banks (over 1 billion in size), on the other hand, increased from 63.4 percent in 1984 to 93.8 percent in 2019. The largest 10 U.S. banks as of 2019 are listed in Table 11-3. The ranking is by consolidated assets at the holding company level. The table also lists size of the domestic assets and domestic assets as a percentage of consolidated assets. The last column shows cumulative consolidated assets

as a percentage of the sum of consolidated assets for all banks. Thus, the top 10 U.S. banks represent 57 percent of consolidated assets for all banks. Notice that several of these large depository institutions manage assets of over 1 trillion. The majority of banks in the two largest size classes are often either regional or superregional banks. Regional or super-regional banks range in size from several billion dollars to several hundred billion dollars in assets. The banks normally are headquartered in larger regional cities and often have offices and branches in locations throughout large portions of the United States. They engage in a more complete array of wholesale banking, or commercial banking, activities encompassing consumer and residential lending as well as commercial and industrial lending (C&I loans), both regionally and nationally. Although these banks provide lending products to large corporate customers, many of the regional banks have developed sophisticated electronic and branching services for consumer and residential customers. Regional and superregional banks utilize retail deposit bases for funding, but also develop relationships with large corporate customers and international money centers. These banks have access to the markets for purchased funds, such as the interbank or federal funds market, to finance their lending and investment activities. Some of the biggest banks are often classified as being money center banks. U.S.-based money center banks include the Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank USA, Goldman Sachs, HSBC North America, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo.[5]

In addition to running traditional banking operations, money center banks provide clearing and correspondent banking services and act as dealers in a broad range of markets, including government securities, FX, derivatives, and offshore markets. Under Basel III, money market banks are called "globally systemically important banks" or G-SIBs. G-SIBs are identified based on the size of banks, their interconnectedness, the lack of readily available substitutes or financial institution infrastructure for the services they provide, their global activity, and their complexity.

# Bank Size and Activities

Bank size has traditionally affected the types of activities and financial performance of commercial banks. Small banks generally concentrate on the retail side of the business—making loans and issuing deposits to consumers and small businesses. In contrast, large banks engage in both retail and wholesale banking and often concentrate on the wholesale side of the business. Further, small banks generally hold fewer off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities than large banks. For example, while small banks issue some loan commitments

and letters of credit, they rarely hold derivative securities. Large banks' relatively easy access to purchased funds and capital markets compared to small banks' access is a reason for many of these differences. For example, with easier access to capital markets, large banks operate with lower amounts of equity capital than do small banks. Also, large banks tend to use more purchased funds (such as fed funds) and have fewer core deposits (deposits such as demand deposits that are stable over short periods of time, see Chapter 12) than do small banks. At the same time, large banks lend to larger corporations. This means that their interest rate spreads (i.e., the difference between their lending rates and deposit rates) and net interest margins (i.e., interest income minus interest expense divided by earning assets) have usually been narrower than those of smaller regional banks, which are more sheltered from competition in highly localized markets and lend to smaller, less sophisticated customers.

In addition, large banks tend to pay higher salaries and invest more in buildings and premises than small banks do. They also tend to diversify their operations and services more than small banks do. Large banks generate more noninterest income (i.e., fees, trading account, derivative security, and foreign trading income) than small banks. Although large banks tend to hold less equity, they do not necessarily return more on their assets. Notice from Figure 11-7 that both the returns on assets (ROAs) and the returns on equity (ROEs) of banks of all sizes dropped significantly during the savings and loan crisis in late 1980s and the financial crisis of 2008-2009. As the economy recovered after the financial crisis, ROA and ROE returned closer to their pre-crisis levels. The recovery occurred quicker for bigger banks that received more government assistance and monitoring throughout the crisis. By 2010, the biggest banks' ROAs and ROEs were the highest. As for the smallest banks, their ROAs and ROEs remained the lowest until 2019. We discuss the banking industry's performance next. We cover the impact of size on bank financial statements and performance in more detail in Chapter 12.

Table 11-4 presents selected performance ratios for the commercial banking industry for 1999 through 2019. During the early 2000s, commercial bank earnings were rising steadily, average ROA for all banks was above 1.0 percent, average ROE was in mid-teens, net interest margins were close to 4.0 percent, and percent of profitable banks were above 90.0 percent. Rates of noncurrent loans and net charge-offs were low, and very few banks failed.

Several explanations have been offered for the strong performance of commercial banks during the early 2000s. First, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates 13 times during this period. Lower interest rates made debt cheaper to service and kept many households and small firms borrowing. Second, lower interest rates made home purchasing more affordable. Thus, the housing market boomed throughout the period. Third, the development of new financial instruments such as credit derivatives and mortgage-backed securities helped banks shift credit risk from their balance sheets to financial markets and other FIs such as insurance companies. Finally, improved information technology helped banks manage their risk better.

As interest rates rose in the mid-2000s, performance did not initially deteriorate significantly. Third quarter 2006 earnings represented the second highest quarterly total ever reported by the industry and more than half of all banks reported higher earnings in the third quarter of 2006 than in the second quarter. However, increased loan-loss provisions, reduced servicing income, and lower trading revenue kept net income reported by commercial banks from setting a new record for the full year. Further, rising funding

9. What the trend in bank performance has been in the commercial banking industry over the last 30 years?

costs outstripped increases in asset yields for a majority of banks. Mortgage delinquencies, particularly subprime mortgage delinquencies, surged in the last quarter of 2006 as home owners who stretched themselves financially to buy homes or refinance mortgages using variable rate mortgages in the early 2000s fell behind on their loan payments as interest rates rose. Despite these weaknesses, the industry's core capital ratio increased to 10.36 percent, the highest level since new, risk-based capital ratios were implemented in 1993. Moreover, no FDIC-insured banks failed during 2005 or 2006. Both the number and the assets of "problem" banks were at historical lows.

The performance in the late 1990s and early and mid-2000s was quite an improvement from the recessionary and high interest rate conditions in which the industry operated in the late 1980s. As reported in Table 11-4, the average ROA and ROE for commercial banks in the early 2000s was as high as 1.38 percent and 15.05 percent, respectively, compared to 1989 when ROA and ROE averaged 0.49 percent and 7.71 percent, respectively. Noncurrent loans to total loans ratio and net charge-offs to total loans ratio averaged 0.80 percent and 0.39 percent, respectively, in 2006, versus 2.30 percent and 1.16 percent, respectively, in 1989. Net operating income (income before taxes and extraordinary items) grew at a rate of 11.19 percent in 2006 versus a drop of 38.70 percent in 1989.

Commercial banks' performance deteriorated again in the late 2000s as the U.S. economy experienced its strongest recession since the Great Depression. For all of 2007, net income was  \$99.94 billion, a decline of\$ 45.28 billion (31.1 percent) from 2006. The average ROA for 2007 was 0.81 percent, the lowest yearly average since 1991 and the first time in 15 years that the industry's annual ROA had been below 1 percent. The ROA for 2008 was 0.03 percent, the lowest since 1987. In addition, one in four institutions (25.0 percent) was unprofitable in 2008.

The industry was still feeling the effects of the long recession in 2009. Net income turned negative 10.0 billion, and the percent of profitable banks dropped below 70.0 percent. ROA and ROE fell to the lowest levels since the savings and loans crisis. Noncurrent loans and net charge-offs continued to rise. Further, 140 commercial banks failed in 2009. This was the largest number of failures since 1992.

As the economy continued to slowly recover in 2010 through 2016, so did bank performance. The 2010 industry ROA and ROE increased to 0.65 percent and 5.85 percent, respectively. By 2016, industry ROA and ROE increased to 1.04 percent and 9.27 percent, respectively. Net income totaled  \$170.5 billion, an increase of\$ 16.2 billion over 2013. Over 95 percent of all banks were profitable in 2016. Number of failed institutions declined from 157 in 2010 to 5 in 2016. Since then, bank performance has continued to improve. By the end of 2019, industry net income reached an all-time high of 233.1 billion, and percent of profitable banks remained high at 96.4 percent. ROA and ROE have fully recovered to pre-crisis levels at 1.29 percent and 11.40 percent, respectively. Similarly, noncurrent loans, net charge-offs, and the number of failed institutions decreased to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2019.

# REGULATORS

LG 11-7

Chapter 13 provides a detailed description of the regulations governing commercial banks and their impact on the banking industry. This section briefly describes the regulators who develop, implement, and monitor these regulations. Unlike other countries that have one or sometimes two regulators, U.S. banks may be subject to the supervision and regulations of as many as four separate regulators. These regulators provide the common rules and regulations under which banks operate. They also monitor banks to ensure they abide by the regulations imposed. As discussed in Chapter 4, it is the regulators' job to, among other things, ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. The key commercial bank regulators are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve System (FRS), and state bank regulators. The next sections discuss the principal role that each plays.

www.fdic.gov

# Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Established in 1933, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures the deposits of commercial banks. In so doing, it levies insurance premiums on banks, manages the deposit insurance fund (which is generated from those premiums and their reinvestment), and conducts bank examinations. In addition, when an insured bank is closed, the FDIC acts as the receiver and liquidator, although the closure decision itself is technically made by the bank's chartering or licensing agency (see below). Because of problems in the thrift industry and the insolvency of the savings association insurance fund (FSLIC) in 1989 (see Chapter 13), the FDIC now manages the insurance fund for both commercial banks and savings associations; the fund is called the Depositors Insurance Fund or DIF. The number of FDIC-insured banks and the division between nationally and state-chartered banks is shown in Figure 11-8.

To see how deposit insurance protects commercial banks from depositor runs, consider the case of Bear Stearns, an investment bank. In the summer of 2007, two Bear Stearns hedge funds suffered heavy losses on investments in the subprime mortgage market. The two funds filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 2007. Bear Stearns's market value was hurt badly by these losses. The losses became so great that by March 2008 Bear Stearns was struggling to finance its day-to-day operations. Lacking any kind of federal insurance of its liabilities, rumors of Bear Stearns's liquidity crisis became a reality as investors began quickly selling off their stock and draining what little liquid assets the firm had left. These events resulted in the first major run on a U.S. FI since the Great Depression. In contrast, during the financial crisis, investors looking for a "safe haven" for their money deposited funds in FDIC-insured depository institutions.

www.occ.treas.gov

# Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the oldest U.S. bank regulatory agency. Established in 1863, it is organized as a subagency of the U.S. Treasury. Its primary function is to charter national banks as well as to close them. In addition, the OCC examines national banks and has the power to approve or disapprove their merger applications. Instead of seeking a national charter, however, banks can seek to be chartered by 1 of 50 individual state bank regulatory agencies.

# dual banking system

The coexistence of both nationally and state-chartered banks, as in the United States.

# www.federalreserve.gov

# holding company

A parent company that owns a controlling interest in a subsidiary bank or other FI.

Historically, state-chartered banks have been subject to fewer regulations and restrictions on their activities than national banks. This lack of regulatory oversight was a major reason many banks chose not to be nationally chartered. Many more recent regulations (such as the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980) attempted to level the restrictions imposed on federal and state-chartered banks (see Chapter 13). Not all discrepancies, however, were changed and state chartered banks are still generally less heavily regulated than nationally chartered banks. The choice of being a nationally chartered or state-chartered bank lies at the foundation of the dual banking system in the United States. Most large banks, such as Citibank, choose national charters, but others have state charters. For example, Morgan Guaranty, the money center bank subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, is chartered as a state bank under State of New York law. In 2019, 1,086 banks were nationally chartered and 4,091 were state chartered, representing 65.3 percent and 34.7 percent, respectively, of all commercial bank assets.

# Federal Reserve System

In addition to being concerned with the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve, as this country's central bank, also has regulatory power over some banks and, where relevant, their holding company parents. All 1,086 nationally chartered banks shown in Figure 11-8 are automatically members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS). In addition, 753 of the state-chartered banks have also chosen to become members. Since 1980, all banks have had to meet the same non-interest-bearing reserve requirements whether they are members of the FRS or not. The primary advantage of FRS membership is direct access to the federal funds wire transfer network for nationwide interbank borrowing and lending of reserves. Finally, many banks are often owned and controlled by parent holding companies—for example, Citigroup is the parent holding company of Citibank (a national

bank). Because the holding company's management can influence decisions taken by a bank subsidiary and thus influence its risk exposure, the FRS regulates and examines bank holding companies as well as the banks themselves.

# State Authorities

As mentioned previously, banks may choose to be state chartered rather than nationally chartered. State-chartered commercial banks are regulated by state agencies. State authorities perform functions similar to those the OCC performs for national banks.

# GLOBAL ISSUES

LG 11-8

For the reasons discussed in earlier chapters, financial institutions are of central importance to the development and integration of markets globally. However, U.S. financial institutions must now compete not only with other domestic financial institutions for a share of these markets, but increasingly with foreign financial institutions. Total assets of banks that report data to the Bank for International Settlements were  \$86.5 trillion in September 2019. Only 18.4 percent of this amount represented assets of U.S. banks. Table 11-5 lists the 20 largest banks in the world, measured by total assets, as of April 2019. Chinese banks dominate the list as 4 of the top 5 banks are headquartered in China. Only 4 of the top 20 banks are U.S. banks. Table 11-6 lists foreign bank offices' assets and liabilities held in the United States from 1992 through 2019. Total foreign bank assets over this period increased from\$ 509.3 billion to \$850.9 billion in 2001, and then fell to \$664.1 billion in 2004 before increasing to \$1,624.5 billion in 2008. Foreign bank assets fell again during the recent financial crisis to a low of \$1,300.2 in 2009, but increased to a historic high of \$2,093.4 billion by 2014 and \$2,089.7 in 2019.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of International Expansion

International expansion has six major advantages.

Risk Diversification. As with domestic geographic expansions, an FI's international activities potentially enhance its opportunity to diversify the risk of its earnings flows. Often domestic earnings flows from financial services are strongly linked to the state of the domestic economy. Therefore, the less integrated the economies of the world are, the greater is the potential for earnings diversification through international expansions.

Economies of Scale. To the extent that economies of scale exist, an FI can potentially lower its average operating costs by expanding its activities beyond domestic boundaries.

Innovations. An FI can generate extra returns from new product innovations if it can sell such services internationally rather than just domestically. For example, consider complex financial innovations, such as securitization, caps, floors, and options, that FIs have innovated in the United States and sold to new foreign markets with few domestic competitors until recently.

Funds Source. International expansion allows an FI to search for the cheapest and most available sources of funds. This is extremely important with the very thin profit margins in domestic and international wholesale banking. It also reduces the risk of fund shortages (credit rationing) in any one market.

Customer Relationships. International expansions also allow an FI to maintain contact with and service the needs of domestic multinational corporations. Indeed, one of the fundamental factors determining the growth of FIs in foreign countries has been the parallel growth of foreign direct investment and foreign trade by globally oriented multinational corporations from the FI's home country.

Regulatory Avoidance. To the extent that domestic regulations such as activity restrictions and reserve requirements impose constraints or taxes on the operations of an FI, seeking low-regulatory, low-tax countries can allow an FI to lower its net regulatory burden and increase its potential net profitability.

In contrast, international expansion has three major disadvantages.

Information/Monitoring Costs. Although global expansions allow an FI the potential to better diversify its geographic risk, the absolute level of exposure in certain areas such as lending can be high, especially if the FI fails to diversify in an optimal fashion. For example, the FI may fail to choose a loan portfolio combination on its efficient portfolio frontier (see Chapter 21). Foreign activities may also be riskier for the simple reason that monitoring and information collection costs are often higher in foreign markets. For example, Japanese and German accounting standards differ significantly from the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that U.S. firms use. In addition, language, legal, and cultural issues can impose additional transaction costs on international activities. Finally, because the regulatory environment is controlled locally and regulation imposes a different array of net costs in each market, a truly global FI must master the various rules and regulations in each market.

Nationalization/Expropriation. To the extent that an FI expands by establishing a local presence through investing in fixed assets such as branches or subsidiaries, it faces the political risk that a change in government may lead to the nationalization of those fixed assets. If foreign FI depositors take losses following a nationalization, they may seek legal recourse from the FI in U.S. courts rather than from the nationalizing government. For example, the resolution of the outstanding claims of depositors in Citicorp's branches in Vietnam following the Communist takeover and expropriation of those branches took many years.

Fixed Costs. The fixed costs of establishing foreign organizations may be extremely high. For example, a U.S. FI seeking an organizational presence in the London banking market faces real estate prices significantly higher than in New York. Such relative costs can be even higher if an FI chooses to enter by buying an existing UK bank rather than establishing a new operation, because of the cost of acquiring UK equities (i.e., paying an acquisition premium). These relative cost considerations become even more important if the expected volume of business to be generated, and thus the revenue flows, from foreign entry are uncertain.

# Global Banking Performance

After it hit the United States, the financial crisis of 2008-2009 quickly spread worldwide. As the crisis spread, banks worldwide saw losses driven by their portfolios of structured finance products and securitized exposures to the subprime mortgage market. Losses were magnified by illiquidity in the markets for those instruments. As with U.S. banks, this led to substantial losses in their market valuations. In Europe, the general picture of bank performance in 2008 was similar to that in the United States. That is, net income fell sharply at all banks. The largest banks in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom had net losses for the year. Banks in Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom were especially hard hit as they had large investments in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, both U.S. and domestic. Because they focused on domestic retail banking, French and Italian banks were less affected by losses on mortgage-backed securities. Continental European banks, in contrast to UK banks, partially cushioned losses through an increase in their net interest margins.

A number of European banks averted outright bankruptcy thanks to direct support from their central banks and national governments. During the last week of September and the first week of October 2008, the German government guaranteed all consumer bank deposits and arranged a bailout of Hypo Real Estate, the country's second-largest commercial property lender. The United Kingdom nationalized mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley (the country's eighth-largest mortgage lender) and raised deposit guarantees from  $62,220 to$ 88,890 per account. Ireland guaranteed the deposits and debt of its six major financial institutions. Iceland rescued its third-largest bank with an \$860 million purchase of 75 percent of the bank's stock and a few days later seized the country's entire banking system. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg central governments together agreed to inject \$16.37 billion into Fortis NV (Europe's first ever cross-border financial services company) to keep it afloat. However, five days later this deal fell apart and the bank was split up. The central bank in India stepped in to stop a run on the country's second-largest bank, ICICI Bank, by promising to pump in cash. Central banks in Asia injected cash into their banking systems as banks' reluctance to lend to each other led the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to inject liquidity into its banking system after rumors led to a run on Bank of East Asia Ltd.

South Korean authorities offered loans and debt guarantees to help small and midsized businesses with short-term funding. The United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, Italy, and Ireland were just a few of the countries to pass an economic stimulus plan and/or bank bailout plan. The Bank of England lowered its target interest rate to a record low of 1 percent hoping to help the British economy out of a recession. The Bank of Canada, Bank of Japan, and Swiss National Bank also lowered their main interest rates to 1 percent or below. All of these actions were a result of the spread of the U.S. financial market crisis to world financial markets.

As a result of the worldwide economic slowdown experienced in the later stages of the crisis, bank losses became more closely connected to macroeconomic performance. Countries across the world saw companies scrambling for credit and cutting their growth plans. Additionally, consumers worldwide reduced their spending. Even China's booming economy slowed more than had been predicted, from 10.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008 to 9 percent in the third quarter. This was the first time since 2002 that China's growth was below 10 percent and dimmed hopes that Chinese demand could help keep world economies growing. In late October 2008, the global crisis hit the Persian Gulf as Kuwait's central bank intervened to rescue Gulf Bank, the first bank rescue in the oil rich region. Until this time, the area had been relatively immune to the world financial crisis. However, plummeting oil prices (which had dropped over 50 percent between July and October 2008) left the area's economies vulnerable. In this period, the majority of bank losses were more directly linked to a surge in borrower defaults and to anticipated defaults as evidenced by the increase in the amount and relative importance of loan loss provision expenses.

International banks' balance sheets continued to shrink during the first half of 2009 (although at a much slower pace than in the preceding six months) and, as in the United States, they began to recover in the latter half of the year. In the fall of 2009, a steady stream of mostly positive macroeconomic news reassured investors that the global economy had turned around, but investor confidence remained fragile. For example, in late November 2009, security prices worldwide dropped sharply as investors reacted to news that government-owned Dubai World had asked for a delay in some payments on its debt. Further, throughout the spring of 2010 Greece struggled with a severe debt crisis. Early on, some of the healthier European countries tried to step in and assist the debt-ridden country. Specifically, in March 2010 a plan led by Germany and France to bail out Greece with as much as 41 billion in aid began to take shape. However, in late April Greek bond prices dropped dramatically as traders began betting a debt default was inevitable, even if the country received a massive bailout. The selloff was the result of still more bad news for Greece, which showed that the 2009 budget deficit was worse than had been previously reported. As a result, politicians in Germany began to voice opposition to a Greek bailout. Further, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Greece's debt rating and warned that additional cuts could be on the way. Greece's debt created heavy losses across the Greek banking sector. A run on Greek banks ensued. Initially, between €100 and €500 million per day was being withdrawn from Greek banks. At its peak, the run on Greek banks produced deposit withdrawals as high as €750 million a day, nearly 0.5 percent of the entire €170 billion deposit base in the Greek banking system.

Problems in the Greek banking system then spread to other European nations with fiscal problems, such as Portugal, Spain, and Italy. The risk of a full-blown banking crisis arose in Spain, where the debt rating of 16 banks and four regions were downgraded by Moody's Investors Service. Throughout Europe, some of the biggest banks announced billions of euros lost from write-downs on Greek loans. In 2011, Crédit Agricole reported a record quarterly net loss of €3.07 billion ( \$4.06 billion U.S.) after a €220 million charge on its Greek debt. Great Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland revalued its Greek bonds at a 79 percent loss—or £1.1 billion (\$ 1.7 billion U.S.)—for 2011. Germany's Commerzbank's fourth quarter 2011 earnings decreased by €700 million due to losses on Greek sovereign debt.

The bank needed to find €5.3 billion to meet the stricter new capital requirements set by Europe's banking regulator. Bailed-out Franco-Belgian bank Dexia warned it risked going out of business due to losses of €11.6 billion from its breakup and exposure to Greek debt and other toxic assets such as U.S. mortgage-backed securities. Even U.S. banks were affected by the European crisis. In late 2010, U.S. banks had sovereign risk exposure to Greece totaling \$43.1 billion. In addition, exposures to Ireland, Portugal, and Spain totaled \$113.9 billion, \$47.1 billion, and \$187.5 billion, respectively. Worldwide, bank exposure to these four countries totaled 2,512.3 billion. Default by a small country like Greece cascaded into something that threatened the world's financial system.

Worried about the effect a Greek debt crisis might have on the European Union, other European countries tried to step in and assist Greece. On May 9, 2010, in return for huge budget cuts, Europe's finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund approved a rescue package worth  \$147 billion and a "safety net" of\$ 1 trillion aimed at ensuring financial stability across Europe. Through the rest of 2010 and into 2012, euro-zone leaders agreed on more measures designed to prevent the collapse of Greece and other member economies. In return, Greece continued to offer additional austerity reforms and agreed to reduce its budget deficits. At times, the extent of these reforms and budget cuts led to worker strikes and protests (some of which turned violent), as well as changes in Greek political leadership. In December 2011, the leaders of France and Germany agreed on a new fiscal pact that they said would help prevent another debt crisis. Then French President Nicolas Sarkozy outlined the basic elements of the plan to increase budget discipline after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris. The pact, which involved amending or rewriting the treaties that govern the European Union, was presented in detail at a meeting of European leaders and approved.

These efforts by the EU and reforms enacted by the Greek and other European country governments appear to have worked. On December 18, 2012, Standard & Poor's raised its rating on Greek debt by six notches, to B minus from selective default. S&P cited a strong and clear commitment from members of the euro zone to keep Greece in the common currency bloc as the main reason for the upgrade. After the bailout, the market price of Greek debt rose: Some hedge funds made huge profits by betting on this bailout effect.

The situation in Greece and the European Union stabilized after 2012. However, a major debt payment was due from Greece to its creditors on June 30, 2015, a payment required to continue to receive rescue funds from the EU. Knowing that they could not make the payment, Greek officials met with euro-zone leaders in an attempt to get a better deal. Greece, however, was unwilling to agree to more spending cuts and other concessions requested by the EU and talks broke down. Greece would be the first developed country to default on its debt and faced the real possibility that it would be forced to leave the EU. With its financial system near collapse and a debt payment due to the ECB on July 20, Greece was forced to continue negotiations with its creditors. A deal was reached on July 13 that essentially required Greece to surrender to all of its creditors' demands, including tax increases, pension reform, and the creation of a fund (under European supervision) that would hold some €50 billion in state-owned assets earmarked to be privatized or liquidated (with the proceeds to be used to pay off Greece's debt and help recapitalize its banks).

While the situation in Greece settled somewhat in the mid-2010s, the European bank system was rocked again in June 2016 when the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU after 43 years (dubbed Brexit). The UK's vote to leave the EU shook the region, precipitating an immediate political crisis in Britain. After more than three-and-a-half years of debate, negotiations and political turmoil, the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. Both the EU and the UK are aiming to hammer out a free trade agreement by the end of 2020. If a trade deal is not in place by December 31, 2020, then Britain will fall back on to basic World Trade Organization terms, meaning tariffs on goods and little practical

cooperation to smooth border checks. The outcome would be effectively same as a no-deal Brexit, and both sides would need to make preparations for how they cope with the economic fallout in 2021. The cataclysmic warnings during the 2016 referendum that London would lose its financial throne if it voted to leave the EU have, so far, been proven wrong. London is still the world's banker, only bigger by some measures. In the first six months of 2019, London has attracted more cross-border commercial real estate investment than any other city. It has overtaken New York as the destination for FinTech investment, and it has increased its dominance of the world's 6.6 trillion daily foreign exchange market. Since the vote to leave the EU, Britain has leapfrogged the United States to become the largest center for trading interest rate swaps, despite calls by ex-French President Francois Holland to end London's dominance in clearing euro-denominated derivatives. It means EU companies will still come to London to raise finance outside the bloc after Brexit, a fact not lost on Wall Street heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Just a mile away from 22 Bishopsgate, Goldman opened its new 1 million square foot European headquarters in July 2019, three years after the 2016 referendum.

# SUMMARY

This chapter provided an overview of the major activities of commercial banks and recent trends in the banking industry. Commercial banks rely heavily on deposits to fund their activities, although borrowed funds are becoming increasingly important for the largest institutions. Historically, commercial banks have concentrated on commercial or business lending and on investing in securities. Differences between the asset and liability portfolios of commercial banks and other financial institutions, however, are being eroded due to competitive forces, consolidation, and regulation. Indeed, in the 2000s, the largest group of assets in commercial bank portfolios were mortgage related. The chapter examined recent financial statements for the commercial banking industry, as well as industry trends in size and activities. Finally, the chapter provided an overview of this industry's performance over the last decade and discussed several global issues in commercial banking.
