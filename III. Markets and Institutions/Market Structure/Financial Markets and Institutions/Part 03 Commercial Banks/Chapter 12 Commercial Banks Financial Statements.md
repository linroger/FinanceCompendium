## Why Evaluate the Performance of Commercial Banks? Chapter Overview

Unlike other private corporations, commercial banks (CBs) are unique in the special services they perform (e.g., assistance in the implementation of monetary policy) and the level of regulatory attention they receive (see Chapters 1 and 13). As a result, CBs are unique in the types of assets and liabilities they hold. Like any for-profit corporation, however, the ultimate measure of a CB's performance is the value of its common equity to its shareholders. This chapter discusses the financial statements of these institutions. Managers, stockholders, depositors, regulators, and other parties use performance, earnings, and other measures obtained from financial statements to evaluate commercial banks. For example, the In The News box looks at how regulators use financial statement data to evaluate the overall safety and soundness of a bank. As we proceed through the chapter, notice the extent to which regulators' evaluation of the overall safety and soundness of a bank (or their assignment of a so-called CAMELS rating) depends on financial statement data. Given the extensive level of regulation and the accompanying requirements for public availability of financial information, the financial statements of commercial banks are ideal candidates to use in examining the performance of depository institutions.

### The CAMELS Evaluation Components

The Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS) was adopted by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) on November 13, 1979. Under the 1997 revision of the UFIRS, each financial institution is assigned a composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution's financial condition and operations that are summarized in a composite "CAMELS" rating. The acronym CAMELS stands for Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Risk.

An institution's Capital Adequacy is evaluated in relation to the volume of risk assets; the volume of marginal and inferior quality assets; the bank's growth experience, plan, and prospects; and the strength of management. Consideration is also given to an institution's capital ratios relative to its peer group, its earnings retention, its dividend policies, and its access to capital markets or other appropriate sources of financial assistance.

Asset Quality is evaluated by the level, distribution, and severity of adversely classified assets; the level and distribution of nonaccrual and reduced-rate assets; the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; and management's demonstrated ability to administer and collect problem credits. In addition, examiners evaluate the volume of concentrations of credit, trends in asset quality, volume of out-of-territory loans, level and severity of other real estate held, and the bank's underwriting standards.

Management is evaluated against virtually all factors considered necessary to operate the bank within accepted banking practices and in a safe and sound manner. Thus, management is evaluated in relation to technical competence; leadership and administrative ability; compliance with banking regulations and statutes; adequacy of, and compliance with, internal policies and controls; and whether the board has a plan covering management succession. The assessment of management also takes into account the quality of internal controls, operating procedures, and all lending, investment, and other operating policies. Finally, examiners review and assess the composition, experience level, abilities, and involvement of the officers, directors, and shareholders.

Earnings are evaluated with respect to their ability to cover losses and provide adequate capital protection; trends; peer group comparisons; the quality and composition of net income; and the degree of reliance on interest-sensitive funds. Consideration is also given to the bank's dividend payout ratio, the rate of growth of retained earnings, and the adequacy of bank capital. The adequacy of provisions to the allowance for loan losses, and the extent which extraordinary items, securities transactions, and tax effects contribute to net income, are also assessed.

Liquidity is evaluated in relation to the volatility of deposits, the frequency and level of borrowings, the use of brokered deposits, technical competence relative to the structure of liabilities, the availability of assets readily convertible into cash, and access to money markets or other ready sources of funds. The overall effectiveness of asset-liability management is considered, as well as the adequacy of, and compliance with, established liquidity policies. The nature, volume, and anticipated use of credit commitments are also factors that are weighed.

The Sensitivity to Market Risk component reflects the degree to which changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices can adversely affect a financial institution's earnings or economic capital. When evaluating this component, consideration should be given to: management's ability to identify, measure, monitor, and control market risk; the institution's size; the nature and complexity of its activities; and the adequacy of its capital and earnings in relation to its level of market risk exposure.

CAMELS ratings range from 1 to 5.*

Composite "1"—Institutions in this group are basically sound in every respect.

Composite "2"—Institutions in this group are fundamentally sound but may reflect modest weaknesses correctable in the normal course of business.

Composite "3"—Institutions in this category exhibit financial, operational, or compliance weaknesses ranging from moderately severe to unsatisfactory.

Composite "4"—Institutions in this group have an immoderate volume of serious financial weaknesses or a combination of other conditions that are unsatisfactory.

Composite "5"—This category is reserved for institutions with an extremely high immediate or near term probability of failure.

*In addition to a composite CAMELS rating, each of the six variables are also rated 1 to 5 by regulators. CAMELS 4 and 5 banks are considered to be "problem" banks.

This chapter uses commercial banks to illustrate a return on equity (ROE) framework as a method of evaluating depository institutions' profitability. The ROE framework decomposes this frequently used measure of profitability into its various component parts to identify existing or potential financial management and risk exposure problems. All financial institutions, and particularly commercial banks, are engaging in an increased level of off-balance-sheet (OBS) activities. These activities produce income (and sometimes losses) for the FI that are reported on the income statement. This chapter also summarizes off-balance-sheet activities (and the risks involved with such activities), which are discussed in more detail in Chapters 20 and 24. Finally, the fact that bank size and/or niche (i.e., the financial market segment the bank specializes in servicing) may affect the evaluation of financial statements is also highlighted.

Financial information on commercial banks is reported in two basic documents. The report of condition (or balance sheet) presents financial information on a bank's assets, liabilities, and equity capital. The balance sheet reports a bank's condition at a single point in time. The report of income (or the income statement) presents the major categories of revenues and expenses (or costs) and the net profit or loss for a bank over a period of time. Financial statements of commercial banks must be submitted to regulators and stockholders at the end of each calendar quarter—March, June, September, and December. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), based in Washington, DC, prescribes uniform principles, standards, and report forms for depository institutions.

To evaluate the performance of commercial banks, we use two financial services institutions of varying sizes and market niches: Heartland Bank and Trust Company and Bank of America Corporation. Excel spreadsheets of the financial statements and financial ratios discussed in this chapter are available through Connect or your course instructor.

Heartland Bank and Trust Company (HBT) is a full-service bank operating in central and northeastern Illinois. On October 10, 2019, HBT Financial Inc. priced its initial public offering (IPO), and on October 11, began trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "HBT." In June 2019, the bank had 2.86 billion in assets, 61 full-service and three limited-service branch locations, and 68 ATMs. In addition to traditional checking and savings accounts, the bank's lending portfolio is weighted toward agricultural, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans. Heartland Bank has the largest deposit market share in the Bloomington, Illinois. The bank also offers online banking and bill pay services, asset management, and trust services. Heartland Bank and Trust Company is widely recognized as one of the strongest and most progressive banks in Illinois. It is a community bank whose roots are based in the heartland.

Bank of America Corporation (BOA) is a financial services holding company, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, with holding company assets of  \$2,395.89 billion and bank assets of\$ 1,806.32 billion as of 2019.

# Balance Sheet Structure

Table 12-1 presents 2019 balance sheet information for the two commercial banks (hereafter called banks). As stated in Chapter 11, many banks are owned by parent bank holding companies. One-bank holding companies control only one subsidiary commercial bank. Multiple-bank holding companies control two or more subsidiary commercial banks (see Chapter 13). The financial statements reported in this chapter are for the consolidated multiple-bank holding company, which includes the parent holding company plus bank subsidiaries. These data are taken from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation call reports, available at the FDIC website. Pay particular attention to the fact that, unlike manufacturing corporations, the majority of a commercial bank's assets are financial assets rather than physical or fixed assets (such as buildings or machines). Additionally, a relatively large portion of a commercial bank's liabilities are short-term deposits and borrowings. In general, banks have higher leverage than manufacturing corporations do.

LG 12-1

Assets. A bank's assets are grouped into four major subcategories: (1) cash and due from depository institutions, (2) investment securities, (3) loans and leases, and (4) other assets. Investment securities and loans and leases are the bank's earning assets. Cash and due from depository institutions (item 5 in Table 12-1) consists of vault cash, deposits at the Federal Reserve (the central bank), deposits at other financial institutions, and cash items in the process of collection. None of these items generates much income for the bank, but each is held because it performs a specific function.

# correspondent bank

A bank that provides services to another commercial bank.

Cash and Due from Depository Institutions. Vault cash (item 1) is composed of the currency and coin needed to meet customer withdrawals. Deposits at the Federal Reserve (item 2) are used primarily to meet legal reserve requirements (see Chapter 13), to assist in check clearing, wire transfers, and the purchase or sale of Treasury securities. Deposits at other financial institutions (item 3) are primarily used to purchase services from those institutions. These banks generally purchase services such as check collection, check processing, fed funds trading, and investment advice from correspondent banks (see below). Cash items in the process of collection (item 4) are checks written against accounts at other institutions that have been deposited at the bank. Credit is given to the depositor of these checks only after they clear.

Investment Securities. Investment securities (item 11 in Table 12-1) consist of federal funds sold, repurchase agreements (RPs or repos), U.S. Treasury and agency securities, securities issued by states and political subdivisions (municipals), mortgage-backed securities, and other debt and equity securities. These securities generate some income for the bank and are used for liquidity risk management purposes. Investment securities

are highly liquid, $^3$  have low default risk, and can usually be traded in secondary markets. Banks generally maintain significant amounts of these securities to ensure that they can easily meet liquidity needs that arise unexpectedly. However, because the revenue generated from investment securities is low compared to that from loans and leases, many (particularly larger) banks attempt to minimize the amount of investment securities they hold.

Short-maturity (less than one year to maturity) investments include federal funds sold and repurchase agreements (item 6), and U.S. Treasury bills and agency securities (item 7). Returns on these investments vary directly with changes in market interest rates. Although banks with excess cash reserves invest some of this in interest-earning liquid assets such as T-bills and short-term securities, they have the option to lend excess reserves for short intervals to other banks seeking increased short-term funding. The interbank market for excess reserves is called the federal funds (fed funds) market. In the United States, federal funds are short-term uncollateralized loans made by one bank to another; more than 90 percent of such transactions have maturities of one day. Repurchase agreements (RPs or repos) can be viewed as collateralized federal funds transactions. In a federal funds transaction, the bank with excess reserves sells fed funds for one day to the purchasing bank. The next day, the purchasing bank returns the fed funds plus one day's interest, reflecting the fed funds rate. Since credit risk exposure exists for the selling bank, because the purchasing bank may be unable to repay the fed funds the next day, the seller may seek collateral backing for the one-day fed funds loan. In an RP transaction, the funds-selling bank receives government securities as collateral from the funds-purchasing bank—that is, the funds-purchasing bank temporarily exchanges securities for cash. The next day, this transaction is reversed—the funds purchasing bank sends back the fed funds it borrowed plus interest (the RP rate); it receives in return (or repurchases) its securities used as collateral in the transaction.

Long-maturity investments such as U.S. Treasury bonds and U.S. agency securities (item 7), Municipals (item 8), mortgage-backed securities (item 9), and most other securities (item 10) usually offer somewhat higher expected returns than short-maturity investments since they are subject to greater interest rate risk exposure—see Chapter 23. U.S. Treasury securities and Government National Mortgage Association (agency) bonds are fully backed by the U.S. government and thus carry no default risk. Other U.S. government agency securities, such as those of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, are not directly backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and therefore carry some default risk (see Chapter 7). Municipal securities held by commercial banks are generally high-rated, investment-grade (i.e., low-risk) securities, issued by municipalities as either general obligation or revenue bonds. Interest paid on Municipals is exempt from federal income tax obligations. Mortgage-backed securities include items such as collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed bonds (see Chapter 7). Other investment securities include investment-grade corporate bonds, foreign debt securities, and securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and Municipals held for short-term trading purposes. These trading account securities earn interest for the bank and generate capital gains or losses from changes in the market values of these securities.

Loans and Leases. Loans and leases (items 12-16 in Table 12-1) are the major asset items on a bank's balance sheet and generate the largest flow of revenue income. However, these items are also the least liquid asset items and the major sources of credit and liquidity risk for most banks. Loans are categorized as commercial and industrial (C&I) loans (item 12), loans secured by real estate (item 13), individual or consumer loans (item 14), and other loans (item 15). Leases (item 16) are used as alternatives to loans when the bank, as owner of a physical asset, allows a customer to use an asset in return for periodic lease payments.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. C&I loans are used to finance a firm's capital needs, equipment purchases, and plant expansion. They can be made in quite small amounts such as  \$100,000 to small businesses or in packages as large as\$ 10 million or more to major corporations. Commercial loans can be made at either fixed rates or floating rates of interest. The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan is set at the beginning of the contract period. This rate remains in force over the loan contract period no matter what happens to market rates. The interest rate on a floating-rate loan can be adjusted periodically according to a formula so that the interest rate risk is transferred in large part from the bank to the borrower. As might be expected, longer-term loans are more likely to be made under floating-rate contracts than are relatively short-term loans. In addition, commercial loans can be made for periods as short as a few weeks to as long as eight years or more. Traditionally, short-term commercial loans (those with an original maturity of one year or less) are used to finance firms' working capital needs and other short-term funding needs, while long-term commercial loans are used to finance credit needs that extend beyond one year, such as the purchase of real assets (machinery), new venture start-up costs, and permanent increases in working capital. Commercial loans can be secured or unsecured. A secured loan (or asset-backed loan) is backed by specific assets of the borrower, while an unsecured loan (or junior debt) gives the lender only a general claim on the assets of the borrower should default occur.

Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans are primarily mortgage loans and some revolving home equity loans (see Chapter 7). For banks (as well as savings institutions), residential mortgages are the largest component of the real estate loan portfolio. Until recently, however, commercial real estate mortgages had been the fastest-growing component of real estate loans. Residential mortgages are very long-term loans with an average maturity of approximately 20 years. As with C&I loans, the characteristics of residential mortgage loans differ widely. As discussed in Chapter 7, these include the size of the loan, the loan-to-value ratio, and the maturity of the mortgage. Other important characteristics are the mortgage interest (or commitment) rate and fees and charges on the loan, such as commissions, discounts, and points paid by the borrower or the seller to obtain the loan. In addition, the mortgage rate differs according to whether the mortgage has a fixed rate or a floating rate, also called an adjustable rate.

Consumer Loans. A third major category of loans is the individual or consumer loan—for example, personal and auto loans. Commercial banks, finance companies, retailers, savings banks, and gas companies also provide consumer loan financing through credit cards such as Visa, MasterCard, and proprietary credit cards issued by companies such as General Electric and AT&T.

Other Loans. Other loans include a wide variety of borrowers and types such as loans to nonbank financial institutions, state and local governments, foreign banks, and sovereign governments.

Each loan category entails a wide variety of characteristics that must be evaluated to determine the risk involved, whether the bank should grant the loan, and, if so, at what price. We discuss the evaluation methods in Chapter 21.

Unearned Income and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Unearned income (item 18) and the allowance (reserve) for loan and lease losses (item 19) are contra-asset accounts that are deducted from gross loans and leases (item 17) on the balance sheet to create net loans and leases (item 20). Unearned income is the amount of income that the bank has received on a loan from a customer but has not yet recorded as income on the income statement. Over the life of the loan, the bank earns (or accrues) interest income and accordingly

# net write-offs

Actual loan losses less loan recoveries.

# earning assets

Investment securities plus net loans and leases.

transfers it out of unearned income into interest income. The allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate by the bank's management of the amount of the gross loans (and leases) that will not be repaid to the bank. Although the maximum amount of the reserve is influenced by tax laws, the bank's management actually sets the level based on loan growth and recent loan loss experience. The allowance for loan losses is an accumulated reserve that is adjusted each period as management recognizes the possibility of additional bad loans and makes appropriate provisions for such losses. Actual losses are then deducted from, and recoveries are added to (referred to as net write-offs), their accumulated loan and lease loss reserve balance.

Investment securities plus net loans and leases are the earning assets of a depository institution. It is these items on the balance sheet that generate interest income and some of the noninterest income described below.

Other Assets. Other assets on the bank's balance sheet (item 26) consist of items such as trading assets (item 21, a separate account managed by banks that buy [underwrite] U.S. government securities and other securities for their own trading account or for resale at a profit to other banks and to the public, rather than for investment in the bank's own investment portfolio), premises and fixed assets (item 22), other real estate owned (collateral seized on defaulted loans—item 23), intangible assets (i.e., goodwill and mortgage servicing rights—item 24), and other (i.e., deferred taxes, prepaid expenses, and mortgage servicing fees receivable—item 25). These accounts are generally a small part of the bank's overall assets.

Liabilities. A bank's liabilities consist of various types of deposit accounts and other borrowings used to fund the investments and loans on the asset side of the balance sheet. Liabilities vary in terms of their maturity, interest payments, check-writing privileges, and deposit insurance coverage.

# NOW accounts

Negotiable order of withdrawal accounts are similar to demand deposits but pay interest when a minimum balance is maintained.

# MMDAs

Money market deposit accounts with retail savings accounts and some limited checking account features.

# other savings deposits

All savings accounts other than MMDAs.

Deposits. Demand deposits (item 28) are transaction accounts held by individuals, corporations, partnerships, and governments that generally pay no explicit interest. Corporations are prohibited from using deposits other than demand deposits (e.g., NOW accounts) for transaction account purposes. This group therefore constitutes the major holders of demand deposits. Since 1980, all banks in the United States have been able to offer checkable deposits that pay interest and are withdrawalsable on demand; they are called negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, or NOW accounts (item 29). The major distinction between these instruments and traditional demand deposits is that these instruments generally require the depositor to maintain a minimum account balance to earn interest. If the minimum balance falls below some level, such as 500, the account formally converts to a status equivalent to a demand deposit and earns no interest. Also, there are restrictions on corporations holding NOW accounts.

Money market deposit accounts or MMDAs (item 30) are an additional liability instrument that banks can use. To make banks competitive with the money market mutual funds offered by groups such as Vanguard and Fidelity, the MMDAs they offer must be liquid. In the United States, MMDAs are checkable but subject to restrictions on the number of checks written on each account per month, the number of preauthorized automatic transfers per month, and the minimum denomination of the amount of each check. In addition, MMDAs impose minimum balance requirements on depositors. The Federal Reserve does not require banks to hold cash reserves against MMDAs. Accordingly, banks generally pay higher rates on MMDAs than on NOW accounts. Other savings deposits (item 31) are all savings accounts other than MMDAs (i.e., regular passbook accounts) with no set maturity and no check-writing privileges. Like MMDAs, savings accounts currently carry zero reserve requirements.

# retail CDs

Time deposits with a face value below 100,000.

# wholesale CDs

Time deposits with a face value of 100,000 or more.

# negotiable instrument

An instrument whose ownership can be transferred in the secondary market.

# brokered deposits

Wholesale CDs obtained through a brokerage house.

Some banks separate foreign from domestic deposits on the balance sheet (item 32). Foreign deposits are not explicitly covered by FDIC-provided deposit insurance guarantees (see Chapter 13). These deposits are generally large and held by corporations with a high level of international transactions and activities.

The major categories of time deposits are retail certificates of deposit (CDs) and wholesale CDs. Retail CDs (item 33) are fixed-maturity instruments with face values under  \$100,000. Although the size, maturity, and rates on these CDs are negotiable, most banks issue standardized retail CDs. Wholesale CDs (item 35) (discussed also in Chapter 5) were created by banks in the early 1960s as a contractual mechanism to allow depositors to liquidate their position in these CDs by selling them in the secondary market rather than having to hold them to maturity or requesting that the bank cash in the deposit early (which involves a penalty cost for the depositor). Thus, a depositor can sell a relatively liquid instrument without causing adverse liquidity risk exposure for the bank. Consequently, the unique feature of wholesale CDs is not so much their large minimum denomination size of\$ 100,000 or more but the fact that they are negotiable instruments. That is, they can be resold by title assignment in a secondary market to other investors. This means, for example, that if IBM had bought a \$1 million three-month CD from JPMorgan Chase, but for unexpected liquidity reasons needed funds after only one month passed, it could sell this CD to another outside investor in the secondary market. This does not impose any obligation on JPMorgan Chase in terms of an early funds withdrawal request. Wholesale CDs obtained through a brokerage or investment house rather than directly from a customer are referred to as brokered deposits. $^7$  CDs held in foreign offices and denominated in dollars are referred to as Eurodollar deposits (see Chapter 5).

Borrowed Funds. The liabilities described previously are all deposit liabilities, reflecting deposit contracts issued by banks in return for cash. However, banks not only fund their assets by issuing deposits, but borrow in various markets for purchased funds. Since the funds generated from these purchases are not deposits, they are subject to neither reserve requirements (as with demand deposits and NOW accounts) nor deposit insurance premium payments to the FDIC (as with all the domestic deposits described earlier). The largest market available for purchased funds is the federal funds market (item 37). As we discussed earlier, a bank with excess reserves can sell them in the fed funds market, recording them as an asset on the balance sheet. The bank that purchases fed funds shows them as a liability on its balance sheet. As with the fed funds market, the RP market (item 37) is a highly liquid and flexible source of funds for banks needing to increase their liabilities and to offset deposit withdrawals. Moreover, like fed funds, these transactions can be rolled over each day if the counterparty is willing. The major difference in flexibility of liability management for fed funds and RPs is that a fed funds transaction can be entered into at virtually any time in the banking day. In general, it is difficult to transact an RP borrowing late in the day since the bank sending the fed funds must be satisfied with the type and quality of the securities' collateral proposed by the borrowing bank. Although this collateral is normally T-bills, T-notes, T-bonds, and mortgage-backed securities, the maturities and other features, such as callability or coupons, may be unattractive to the fund seller.

Fed funds and RPs have been the major sources of borrowed funds, but banks have utilized other borrowing (item 38) sources to supplement their flexibility in liability management. Four of these sources are banker's acceptances (BAs), commercial paper, medium-term notes, and discount window loans. Banks often convert off-balance-sheet letters of credit into on-balance-sheet BAs by discounting the letter of credit when the holder presents it for acceptance (see Chapter 5). In addition, these BAs may be resold to money market investors. As a result, BA sales to the secondary market are an additional funding source. Although a bank subsidiary itself cannot issue commercial paper, its parent holding company can—that is, Citigroup can issue commercial paper but Citibank cannot. This provides banks owned by holding companies—most of the largest banks in the United States—with an additional funding source, since the holding company can "downstream" funds generated from its commercial paper sales to its bank subsidiary. Finally, banks facing temporary liquidity crunches can borrow from the central bank's discount window at the discount rate. Since this rate is not market determined and usually lies below government security rates, it offers a very attractive borrowing opportunity to a bank with deficient reserves as the reserve maintenance period comes to an end (see Chapter 13).

A number of banks in search of stable sources of funds with low withdrawal risk have begun to issue subordinated notes and debentures (item 39), often in the fiveto seven-year range. These notes are especially attractive because they are subject to neither reserve requirements nor deposit insurance premiums, and some can serve as (Tier II) capital for the bank to satisfy Federal Reserve regulations regarding minimum capital requirements (see Chapter 13).

LG 12-2

# core deposits

Deposits of the bank that are stable over short periods of time and thus provide a long-term funding source to a bank.

# purchased funds

Rate-sensitive funding sources of the bank.

Some banks separate core deposits from purchased funds on their balance sheets. The stable deposits of the bank are referred to as core deposits (item 34). These deposits are not expected to be withdrawn over short periods of time and are therefore a more permanent source of funding for the bank. Core deposits are also the cheapest funds banks can use to finance their assets. Because they are both a stable and low-cost source of funding, core deposits are the most frequently used source of funding by commercial banks. Core deposits generally are defined as demand deposits, NOW accounts, MMDAs, other savings accounts, and retail CDs. Purchased funds are more expensive and/or volatile sources of funds because they are highly rate sensitive—these funds are more likely to be immediately withdrawn or replaced as rates on competitive instruments change. Further, interest rates on these funds, at any point in time, are generally higher than rates on core deposits. Purchased funds are generally defined as brokered deposits, wholesale CDs, deposits at foreign offices, fed funds purchased, RPs, and subordinated notes and debentures.

Other Liabilities. Banks also list other liabilities (item 40) that do not require interest to be paid. These items consist of accrued interest, deferred taxes, dividends payable, minority interests in consolidated subsidies, and other miscellaneous claims.

Equity Capital. The bank's equity capital (item 46) consists mainly of preferred (item 42) and common (item 43) stock (listed at par value), surplus and additional paid-in capital (item 44), and retained earnings (item 45). Regulations require banks to hold a minimum level of equity capital to act as a buffer against losses from their onand off-balance-sheet assets (see Chapter 13).

# Off-Balance-Sheet Assets and Liabilities

Off-balance-sheet (OBS) items are contingent assets and liabilities that may affect the future status of a financial institution's balance sheet. OBS activities are less obvious and often invisible to financial statement readers because they usually appear "below the bottom line," frequently as footnotes to accounts. As part of the quarterly financial reports submitted to regulators, schedule L lists the notional dollar size of OBS activities of banks. We briefly summarized the OBS activities of commercial banks in Chapter 11. In this chapter, we introduce the items as they appear off the FI's balance sheet.

Although OBS activities are now an important source of fee income for many FIs, they have the potential to produce positive as well as negative future cash flows. Some OBS activities can involve risks that add to the institution's overall risk exposure; others can hedge or reduce the institution's interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. A depository institution's performance and solvency are also affected by the management of these items. Off-balance-sheet activities can be grouped into four major categories: loan commitments, letters of credit, loans sold, and derivative securities. The OBS activities for Heartland Bank and Trust and Bank of America are reported in Table 12-2.

LG 12-3

# loan commitment

Contractual commitment to loan to a firm a certain maximum amount at given interest rate terms.

# up-front fee

The fee charged for making funds available through a loan commitment.

# commitment fee

The fee charged on the unused component of a loan commitment.

# commercial letters of credit (LCs)

Contingent guarantees sold by an FI to underwrite the trade or commercial performance of the buyers of the guarantees.

# standby letters of credit (SLCs)

Guarantees issued to cover contingencies that are potentially more severe and less predictable than contingencies covered under trade-related or commercial letters of credit.

Loan Commitments. These days, most commercial and industrial loans are made by firms that take down (or borrow against) prenegotiated lines of credit or loan commitments rather than borrow cash immediately in the form of spot loans. A loan commitment agreement (item 1 in Table 12-2) is a contractual commitment by a bank or another FI (such as an insurance company) to loan to a customer a certain maximum amount (say,  \$10 million) at given interest rate terms (say, 12 percent). The loan commitment agreement also defines the length of time over which the borrower has the option to take down this loan. In return for making this loan commitment, the bank may charge an up-front fee (or facility fee) of, say, 1/8 percent of the commitment size, or\$ 12,500 in this example. In addition, the bank must stand ready to supply the full \$10 million at any time over the commitment period—for example, one year. Meanwhile, the borrower has a valuable option to take down any amount between  \$0 and\$ 10 million over the commitment period. The bank may also charge the borrower a commitment fee on any unused commitment balances at the end of the period. In this example, if the borrower takes down only \$8 million over the year and the fee on unused commitments is 1/4 percent, the bank generates additional revenue of 1/4 percent times \$2 million, or \$5,000.

Note that only when the borrower actually draws on the commitment do the loans made under the commitment appear on the balance sheet. Thus, only when the  \$8 million loan is taken down exactly halfway through the one-year commitment period (i.e., six months later) does the balance sheet show the creation of a new\$ 8 million loan. We illustrate the transaction in Figure 12-1. When the \$10 million commitment is made at time 0, nothing shows on the balance sheet. Nevertheless, the bank must stand ready to supply the full \$10 million in loans on any day within the one-year commitment period—at time 0 a new contingent claim on the resources of the bank is created. At time 6 months, when the \$8 million is drawn down, the balance sheet will reflect this as an \$8 million loan.

Commercial Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. In selling commercial letters of credit (LCs) (item 2 in Table 12-2) and standby letters of credit (SLCs) (item 3) for fees, banks add to their contingent future liabilities. Commercial letters of credit are widely used in both domestic and international trade. For example, they ease the shipment of grain between a farmer in Iowa and a purchaser in New Orleans or the shipment of goods between a U.S. importer and a foreign exporter. The bank's role is to

provide a formal guarantee that payment for goods shipped or sold will be forthcoming regardless of whether the buyer of the goods defaults on payment.

Standby letters of credit perform an insurance function similar to commercial and trade letters of credit. The structure and type of risk covered differ, however. FIs may issue SLCs to cover contingencies that are potentially more severe, less predictable or frequent, and not necessarily trade related. These contingencies include performance bond guarantees by which an FI may guarantee that a real estate development will be completed in some interval of time. Alternatively, the FI may offer default guarantees to back an issue of commercial paper or municipal revenue bonds to allow issuers to achieve a higher credit rating and a lower funding cost than otherwise would be possible.

Both LCs and SLCs are essentially guarantees to underwrite performance that a depository institution sells to the buyers of the guarantees (such as a corporation). In economic terms, the depository institution that sells LCs and SLCs is selling insurance against the frequency or severity of some particular future event occurring. Further, similar to the different lines of insurance sold by property-casualty insurers, LC and SLC contracts differ as to the severity and frequency of their risk exposures.

# loans sold

Loans originated by the bank and then sold to other investors that can be returned to the originating institution.

# recourse

The ability to put an asset or loan back to the seller should the credit quality of that asset deteriorate.

Loans Sold. Loans sold (item 4 in Table 12-2) are loans that a bank has originated and then sold to other investors that may be returned (sold with recourse) to the originating institution in the future if the credit quality of the loans deteriorates. We discuss the types of loans that banks sell, their incentives to sell, and the way in which they can sell them in more detail in Chapter 25. Banks and other FIs increasingly originate loans on their balance sheets, but rather than holding the loans to maturity, they quickly sell them to outside investors. These outside investors include other banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, or even corporations. In acting as loan originators and loan sellers, banks are operating more as loan brokers than as traditional asset transformers (see Chapters 1 and 11).

When an outside party buys a loan with absolutely no recourse to the seller of the loan should the loan eventually go bad, loan sales have no OBS contingent liability implications for banks. Specifically, no recourse means that if the loan the bank sells should go bad, the buyer of the loan must bear the full risk of loss. In particular, the buyer cannot go back to the seller or originating bank to seek payment on the bad loan. Suppose that the loan is sold with recourse. Then, loan sales present a long-term off-balance-sheet or contingent credit risk to the seller. Essentially, the buyer of the loan holds an option to put the loan back to the seller, which the buyer can exercise should the credit quality of the purchased loan materially deteriorate. In reality, the recourse or nonrecourse nature of loan sales is often ambiguous. For example, some have argued that banks generally are willing to repurchase bad no-recourse loans to preserve their reputations with their customers. Obviously, reputation concerns may extend the size of a selling bank's contingent liabilities from OBS activities.

# derivative securities

Futures, forward, swap, and option positions taken by the FI for hedging or other purposes.

Derivative Contracts. Derivative securities (items 5 to 8 in Table 12-2) are the futures, forward, swap, and option positions taken by a bank for hedging and other purposes (see Chapters 10 and 24). We discussed the tremendous growth of derivative securities activity in Chapter 11. Banks can be either users of derivative contracts for hedging (see Chapters 10 and 24) and other purposes or dealers that act as intermediaries in trades with customers for a fee. It has been estimated that some 1,340 U.S. banks use derivatives and that four large dealer banks—JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America—account for some 88 percent of the derivatives that user banks hold.[8]

Counterparty, or contingent credit, risk is likely to be present when banks expand their positions in futures, forward, swap, and option contracts. This risk relates to the fact that the counterparty to one of these contracts may default on payment obligations, leaving the bank unhedged and having to replace the contract at today's interest rates, prices, or exchange rates, which may be relatively unfavorable. In addition, such defaults are most likely to occur when the counterparty is losing heavily on the contract and the bank is in the money on the contract. This type of default risk is much more serious for forward contracts than for futures contracts. This is because forward contracts are nonstandard contracts entered into bilaterally by negotiating parties, such as two banks, and all cash flows are required to be paid at one time (on contract maturity). Thus, they are essentially over-the-counter (OTC) arrangements with no external guarantees should one or the other party default on the contract (see Chapter 10). By contrast, futures contracts are standardized contracts guaranteed by organized exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Futures contracts, like forward contracts, make commitments to deliver foreign exchange (or some other asset) at some future date. If a counterparty were to default on a futures contract, however, the exchange would assume the defaulting party's position and payment obligations.

Option contracts can also be traded over the counter (OTC) or bought/sold on organized exchanges. If the options are standardized options traded on exchanges, such as bond options, they are virtually default risk free. If they are specialized options purchased OTC, such as interest rate caps (see Chapter 10), some elements of default risk exist. Similarly, swaps are OTC instruments normally susceptible to default risk (see Chapter 10). In general, default risk on OTC contracts increases with the time to maturity of the contract and the fluctuation of underlying prices, interest rates, or exchange rates.

# Other Fee-Generating Activities

Commercial banks engage in other fee-generating activities that cannot be easily identified from analyzing their onand off-balance-sheet accounts. These include trust services, processing services, and correspondent banking.

Trust Services. The trust department of a commercial bank holds and manages assets for individuals or corporations. Only the largest banks have sufficient staff to offer trust services. Individual trusts represent about one-half of all trust assets managed by commercial banks. These trusts include estate assets and assets delegated to bank trust departments by less financially sophisticated investors. Pension fund assets are the second largest group of assets managed by the trust departments of commercial banks. The banks manage the pension funds, act as trustees for any bonds held by the pension funds, and act as transfer and disbursement agents for the pension funds.

8. See OCC Bank Derivative Report, Second Quarter 2019, and Chapter 10.
9. Note that the options still can be subject to interest rate risk; see the discussion in Chapter 24.
10. Under an interest rate cap, the seller, in return for a fee, promises to compensate the buyer should interest rates rise above a certain level. If rates rise much more than expected, the cap seller may have an incentive to default to truncate the losses. Thus, selling a cap is similar to a bank's selling interest rate risk insurance (see Chapter 10 for more details).
11. In a swap, two parties contract to exchange interest rate payments or foreign exchange payments. If interest rates (or foreign exchange rates) move a good deal, one party can face considerable future loss exposure, creating incentives to default.
12. Reputational considerations and the need for future access to markets for hedging deter the incentive to default (see Chapter 24 as well). However, most empirical evidence suggests that derivative contracts have reduced FI risk.

**Processing Services.** Commercial banks have traditionally provided financial data processing services for their business customers. These services include managing a customer's accounts receivable and accounts payable. Similarly, bank cash management services include the provision of lockbox services where customers of a firm send payments to a post office box managed by a bank, which opens, processes, collects, and deposits checks within a very short time (sometimes as short as one hour) in the business customer's account. Banks also provide personalized services for both large and small companies, including moving funds from savings accounts that earn interest to transactions accounts that do not earn interest as firms need to make payments. The larger commercial banks have broadened their range of business services to include management consulting, data processing, and information systems or other technological services. Information systems and software marketed by commercial banks assist clients in collecting, analyzing, and reporting data effectively and efficiently.

Correspondent Banking. Correspondent banking is the provision of banking services to other banks that do not have the staff resources to perform the service themselves. These services include check clearing and collection, foreign exchange trading, hedging services, and participation in large loan and security issuances. Correspondent banking services are generally sold as a package of services. Payment for the services is generally in the form of non-interest-bearing deposits held at the bank offering the correspondent services.

LG 12-4

# Income Statement

See Table 12-3 for the report of income or income statement for Heartland Bank and Trust and Bank of America for 2019. The report of income identifies the interest income and expenses, net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income and expenses, income before taxes and extraordinary items, and net income for the banks earned from the onand off-balance-sheet activities described earlier. As we discuss the income statement, notice the direct relationship between it and the balance sheet (both on and off balance sheet). The composition of an FI's assets and liabilities, combined with the interest rates earned or paid on them, directly determines the interest income and expense on the income statement. In addition, because the assets and liabilities of FIs are mainly financial, most of the income and expense items reported on the income statement are interest rate related (rather than reflecting sales prices and cost of goods sold, as seen with manufacturing corporations).

Interest Income. The income statement for a commercial bank first shows the sources of interest income (item 14). Interest and fee income on loans and leases (item 6 in Table 12-3) is the largest interest income-producing category. Subcategories are often listed on the income statement (items 1-4) for each category of loan listed earlier. Most banks also list income on leases (item 5) as a separate item. Interest on investment securities held (item 13) is also included as interest income. These too may be listed by subcategories (items 7-12) described earlier. Interest income is recorded on an accrued basis (see earlier discussion). Thus, loans on which interest payments are past due can still be recorded as generating income for a bank.[13] Interest income is taxable, except for that on municipal securities and tax-exempt income from direct lease financing. Tax-exempt interest can be converted to a taxable equivalent basis as follows:

$$
\text{Ta xa bl e} = \frac{\text{In te rs it e} = \frac{\text{In te rs it e} \mathrm{in co me}}{1 - \text{Ba nk} \mathrm{s} \text{ta x} \text{ra te}}
$$

Interest Expenses. Interest expense (item 24) is the second major category on a bank's income statement. Items listed here come directly from the liability section of the balance

Interest on subordinated notes and debentures (item 23) is generally reported as a separate item.

Net Interest Income. Total interest income minus total interest expense is listed next on the income statement as net interest income (item 25). Net interest income is an important tool in assessing the bank's ability to generate profits and control interest rate risk (see below).

Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses (item 26) is a noncash, tax-deductible expense. The provision for loan losses is the current period's allocation to the allowance for loan losses listed on the balance sheet. This item represents the bank management's prediction of loans at risk of default for the period. While the loans remain on the bank's balance sheet, the expected losses from any bad loans affect net income and equity on the income statement and balance sheet, respectively. For example, during the financial crisis Bank of America increased its loan loss reserve (recording a provision for loan losses) by 13.4 billion in the second quarter of 2009. This loan-loss provision expense was recorded in recognition of expected losses on mortgages and loans tied to the financial crisis. As a result, Bank of America's earnings per share fell 54 percent.

As mentioned earlier, the size of the provision is determined by management, and in the United States it is subject to a maximum allowable tax-deductible amount set by the Internal Revenue Service. Currently, banks do not have to record a provision until there are signs of a loss on a loan. However, a key reform emerging from the financial crisis is a rule that would require banks to look ahead and record a provision for loan loss on the day a loan is made. The rules for recording provisions were faulted as being too little, too late during the financial crisis. Many banks were battered by defaults on loans for which no provision had been set aside. As a remedy, banking regulators have called for the timelier recording of provisions. Critics, however, warn that the proposed changes will make earnings more volatile as banks must continuously adjust their expectations for losses. FASB officials estimated some U.S. banks would require a 50 percent increase in reserves under the proposed change. The rules were approved in June 2016. Banks that are publicly traded had to adopt the FASB's change beginning in 2020 and privately held banks in 2021.

# EXAMPLE 12-1 The Relationship between Allowance for Loan Losses, Provision for Loan Losses, and Loan Balances

At the beginning of the month, a bank has  \$1 million in its loan portfolio and\$ 50,000 in the allowance for loan losses (see Panel a of Figure 12-2). During the month, management estimates that an additional \$5,000 of loans will not be paid as promised. Accordingly, the bank records an expense to loan loss provision (which reduces net income and thus retained earnings and equity of the bank) and increases the allowance for loan losses to \$55,000 on the balance sheet (see Panel b in Figure 12-2). Notice that the loan is still listed as an asset on the bank's balance sheet at this time. After another month, management feels there is no chance of recovering the loan and writes the \$5,000 loan off its books. At this time, loans are reduced by \$5,000 as is the allowance for loan losses (see Panel c in Figure 12-2). Notice when the loan is considered unrecoverable and actually removed from the balance sheet, there is no impact on the bank's income or equity value.

Noninterest Income. Noninterest income (item 35) includes all other income received by the bank as a result of its onand off-balance-sheet activities and is becoming increasingly important as the ability to attract core deposits and high-quality loan applicants becomes

# total operating income

The sum of the interest income and noninterest income.

more difficult. Included in this category is income from fiduciary activities (for example, earnings from operating a trust department—item 27), service charges on deposit accounts (item 28), trading revenues (gains [losses] and fees from trading marketable instruments and OBS derivative instruments—item 29), fees from other-than-banking activities such fees from investment banking and security brokerage (item 30), fees from insurance (item 31), servicing fees from mortgages, credit cards, and other assets (item 32), gains and losses from the sale of loans and investment securities (item 33), and other noninterest income (fee income from OBS loan commitments and letters of credit, ATM fees, money order, cashier's check, and travelers' check fees, data processing revenue, and revenue from one-time transactions such as sales of real estate owned, loans, premises, and fixed assets—item 34).

The sum of interest income and noninterest income is referred to as the bank's total operating income or total revenue. Total operating income for a bank is equivalent to total sales in a manufacturing firm and represents the bank's income received from all sources.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense (item 39) items consist mainly of personnel expenses and are generally large relative to noninterest income. Items in this category include salaries and employee benefits (item 36), expenses of premises and fixed assets (i.e., utilities and depreciation—item 37), and other operating expenses (e.g., deposit insurance premiums and expenses of one-time transactions such as losses on the sale of real estate, loans, and premises—item 38). For almost all banks, noninterest expense is greater than noninterest income. Thus, noninterest expense is sometimes referred to as the "burden" of the bank.

Income before Taxes and Extraordinary Items. Net interest income minus provisions for loan losses plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense produces the operating profit or income before taxes and extraordinary items for the bank (item 40).

Income Taxes. All federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes due from the bank are listed next on the income statement (item 41). Some of this amount may have been paid to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the remainder is recorded as a liability (deferred taxes) to be paid to the IRS later.

Extraordinary Items. Extraordinary items and other adjustments (item 42) are events or transactions that are both unusual and infrequent. This includes such things as effects of changes in accounting rules, corrections of accounting errors made in previous years, and equity capital adjustments (losses from a major disaster such as an earthquake in an area where earthquakes are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future).

Net Income. Income before taxes and extraordinary items minus income taxes plus (or minus) extraordinary items results in the net income for the bank (item 43). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement.

# Direct Relationship between the Income

# Statement and the Balance Sheet

As mentioned earlier, banks' financial statements are directly related (more so than for nonfinancial companies). That is, the items on the income statement are determined by the balance sheet assets and liabilities along with the interest rates on each item. This direct relationship between the two financial statements can be seen by depicting the income statement as follows:

$$
N I = \sum_{n = 1}^{N} r_{n} A_{n} - \sum_{m = 1}^{M} r_{m} L_{m} - P + N I I - N I E - T
$$ where


${NI} =$  Bank's net income

$A_{n} =$  Dollar value of the bank's nth asset

$L_{m} =$  Dollar value of the bank's mth liability

$r_n =$  Rate earned on the bank's nth asset

$r_m =$  Rate paid on the bank's  $m$ th liability

$P =$  Provision for loan losses

$NII =$  Noninterest income earned by the bank, including income from off-balance-sheet activities

$NIE =$  Noninterest expenses incurred by the bank

$T =$  Bank's taxes and extraordinary items

$N =$  Number of assets the bank holds

$M =$  Number of liabilities the bank holds

Net income is the direct result of (1) the amount and mix of assets and liabilities held by the bank taken from the balance sheet and (2) the interest rate on each of them. For example, increasing the dollar value of an asset, all else constant, results in a direct increase in the bank's net income equal to the size of the increase times the rate of interest on the asset. Likewise, decreasing the rate paid on a liability, all else constant, directly increases net income by the size of the rate decrease times the dollar value of the liability on the balance sheet. Finally, changing the mix of assets or liabilities on the balance sheet has a direct effect on net income equal to the size of the rate difference times the dollar value of the asset or liability being changed. For example, suppose that a bank has the following net income:


$$

N I = 0. 0 4 6 (1 \mathrm{m .}) + 0. 0 6 (3 \mathrm{m .}) - 0. 0 3 5 (3 \mathrm{m .}) - 0. 0 4 7 5 (1 \mathrm{m .}) = \$ 7 3, 5 0 0

$$

The bank replaces  \$500,000 of assets currently yielding 4.60 percent with assets yielding 6 percent. As a result, net income increases by\$ 7,000 [(6\% - 4.6\%) × 500,000], or

$$

N I = 0. 0 4 6 (0. 5 \mathrm{m .}) + 0. 0 6 (3. 5 \mathrm{m .}) - 0. 0 3 5 (3 \mathrm{m .}) - 0. 0 4 7 5 (1 \mathrm{m .}) = \$ 8 0, 5 0 0

# FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS USING A RETURN ON EQUITY FRAMEWORK

# time series analysis

Analysis of financial statements over a period of time.

# cross-sectional analysis

Analysis of financial statements comparing one firm with others.

www.fffiec.gov/UBPR.htm

In the early and mid-2000s, the commercial banking industry experienced a period of record profits. The financial crisis brought about an abrupt reversal of this trend. During periods of falling profits and even during periods of record profits, many banks have weak and inefficient areas that need to be addressed. One way to identify weaknesses and problem areas is by analyzing financial statements. In particular, an analysis of selected accounting ratios—ratio analysis—allows a bank manager to evaluate the bank's current performance, the change in its performance over time (time series analysis of ratios over a period of time), and its performance relative to that of competitor banks (cross-sectional analysis of ratios across a group of firms).

Analyzing ratio trends over time, along with absolute ratio levels, gives managers, analysts, and investors information about whether a firm's financial condition is improving or deteriorating. For example, ratio analysis may reveal that a bank's capital-to-assets ratio is decreasing. This suggests that capital is decreasing as a source of financing the assets of the bank and that deposits and purchased funds are being increasingly used to finance the bank's assets. If this increase is the result of a deliberate policy to decrease capital and use cheaper sources of asset financing, the decreased capital ratio is good for the bank. Managers and investors should be concerned, on the other hand, if a decreased capital-to-asset ratio is the result of declining profits.

Looking at one bank's financial ratios, even through time, gives managers, analysts, and investors only a limited picture of bank performance. Ratio analysis almost always includes a comparison of one bank's ratios relative to the ratios of other firms in the industry, or cross-sectional analysis. Key to cross-sectional analysis is identifying similar banks in that they compete in the same markets, have similar sized assets, and operate in a similar manner to the bank being analyzed. Since no two banks are identical, obtaining such a comparison group is no easy task. Thus, the choice of companies to use in cross-sectional analysis is at best subjective. A tool available to assist in cross-sectional analysis is the Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) maintained by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The UBPR summarizes the performance of banks for various peer groups (banks similar in size and economic environment), for various size groups, and by state.

Figure 12-3 summarizes the return on equity (ROE) framework. $^{14}$  The ROE framework starts with the most frequently used measure of profitability, ROE, and then breaks it down to identify strengths and weaknesses in a bank's performance. The resulting breakdown provides a convenient and systematic method to identify strengths and weaknesses of a bank's profitability. Identification of strengths and weaknesses, and the reasons for them, provides an excellent tool for bank managers as they look for ways to improve profitability. Table 12-4 summarizes the role of ROE and the first two levels of the ROE framework (from Figure 12-3) in analyzing an FI's performance.

The remainder of this chapter applies the ROE framework to our two banks: Heartland Bank and Trust and Bank of America. All of the ratios discussed as part of the ROE breakdown are reported in Tables 12-5 through 12-7. We refer to these ratios by number (1 through 127). In addition, Figure 12-3 lists these ratios (by ratio number) as they fit into the ROE framework.

# LG 12-5

# Return on Equity and Its Components

ROE (ratio 1 in Table 12-5) is defined as:

$$

\mathrm{RO E} = \frac{\text{Ne ti nc om e}}{\text{To ta le qu it yc ap it al}}

$$

It measures the amount of net income after taxes earned for each dollar of equity capital contributed by the bank's stockholders. Taking these data from the financial statements for Heartland Bank and Trust and Bank of America, the banks' ROEs for 2019 were:15

<table><tr><td></td><td>Heartland</td><td>Bank of America</td></tr><tr><td>ROE</td><td>61.958/335.634 = 18.46\%</td><td>29,662/214,579 = 13.82\%</td></tr></table>

Generally, bank stockholders prefer ROE to be high. It is possible, however, that an increase in ROE indicates increased risk. For example, ROE increases if total equity capital decreases relative to net income. A large drop in equity capital may result in a violation of minimum regulatory capital standards and an increased risk of insolvency for the bank (see Chapters 13 and 23). An increase in ROE may simply result from an increase in a bank's leverage—an increase in its debt-to-equity ratio.

To identify potential problems, ROE (ratio 1) can be decomposed into two component parts, as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{RO E} = \frac{\text{Ne ti nc om e}}{\text{To ta la ss et s}} \times \frac{\text{To ta la ss et s}}{\text{To ta le qu it yc ap it al}} \\ = \mathrm{RO A} \times \mathrm{EM} \\ \end{array}

$$ where


ROA (ratio 2) = Return on assets (a measure of profitability linked to the asset size of the bank)

EM (ratio 3) = Equity multiplier (a measure of leverage)

ROA determines the net income produced per dollar of assets. EM measures the dollar value of assets funded with each dollar of equity capital (the higher this ratio, the more leverage or debt the bank is using to fund its assets). The values of these ratios for our two banks in 2019 were:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Heartland</td><td>Bank of America</td></tr><tr><td>ROA</td><td>61.958/2,858.427 = 2.17\%</td><td>29,662/1,806,323 = 1.64\%</td></tr><tr><td>EM</td><td>2,858.427/335.634 = 8.52 times</td><td>1,806,323/214,579 = 8.42 times</td></tr></table>

15. We are using quarter-end balance sheet data to calculate ratios. The use of these data may bias ratios in that they are data for one day in the year, whereas income statement data cover the full year. To avoid this bias, average values for balance sheet data are often used to calculate ratios.

Note: Ratios 6-8 are discussed in the section "Other Ratios" later in the chapter.

TABLE 12-4 Role of ROE, ROA, EM, PM, and AU in Analyzing Financial Institution Performance

Return on equity (ROE)—measures overall profitability of the FI per dollar of equity.

Return on assets (ROA)—measures profit generated relative to the FI's assets.

Equity multiplier (EM)—measures the extent to which assets of the FI are funded with equity relative to debt.

Profit margin (PM)—measures the ability to pay expenses and generate net income from interest and noninterest income.

Asset utilization (AU)—measures the amount of interest and noninterest income generated per dollar of total assets.

TABLE 12-5 Overall Performance Ratios for Two Commercial Banks

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Ratio</td><td>Heartland Bank and Trust</td><td>Bank of America</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>ROE</td><td>18.46</td><td>13.82</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>ROA</td><td>2.17</td><td>1.64</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Equity multiplier</td><td>8.52×</td><td>8.42×</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Profit margin</td><td>39.38</td><td>34.07</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Asset utilization</td><td>5.50</td><td>4.82</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Net interest margin</td><td>4.75</td><td>3.67</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Spread</td><td>4.71</td><td>3.65</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Overhead efficiency</td><td>29.82</td><td>71.62</td></tr></table>

High values for these ratios produce high ROEs, but, as noted, managers should be concerned about the source of high ROEs. For example, an increase in ROE due to an increase in the EM means that the bank's leverage, and therefore its solvency risk, has increased.

# Return on Assets and Its Components

A further breakdown of a bank's profitability is that of dividing ROA (ratio 2 in Table 12-5) into its profit margin (PM) and asset utilization (AU) ratio components:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{RO A} = \frac{\text{Ne ti nc om e}}{\text{To ta lo pe ra ti ng in co me}} \times \frac{\text{To ta lo pe ra ti ng in co me}}{\text{To ta la ss et s}} \\ = \mathrm{PM} \times \mathrm{AU} \\ \end{array}

$$ where


PM (ratio 4) = Net income generated per dollar of total operating (interest and noninterest) income

AU (ratio 5) = Amount of interest and noninterest income generated per dollar of total assets

For our two banks, these are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Heartland</td><td>Bank of America</td></tr><tr><td>PM</td><td>61.958/132.902 + 24.430 = 39.38\%</td><td>29,662/61,192 + 25,874 = 34.07\%</td></tr><tr><td>AU</td><td>132.902 + 24.430/2,858.427 = 5.51\%</td><td>61,192 + 25,874/1,806,323 = 4.82\%</td></tr></table>

Again, high values for these ratios produce high ROAs and ROEs. PM measures the bank's ability to control expenses. The better the expense control, the more profitable the bank. AU measures the bank's ability to generate income from its assets. The more income generated per dollar of assets, the more profitable the bank. Again, bank managers should be aware that high values of these ratios may indicate underlying problems. For example, PM increases if the bank experiences a drop in salaries and benefits. However, if this expense decreases because the most highly skilled employees are leaving the bank, the increase in PM and in ROA is associated with a potential "labor quality" problem. Thus, it is often prudent to break these ratios down further.

Profit Margin. As stated, PM measures a bank's ability to control expenses and thus its ability to produce net income from its operating income (or revenue). A breakdown of PM, therefore, can isolate the various expense items listed on the income statement as follows (ratios used to decompose the profit margin are listed in Table 12-6):


$$

\text{In te re st} \quad \text{ex pe ns e} \quad \text{ra ti o} \quad (r a t i o 9) = \frac{\text{In te re st} \quad \text{ex pe ns e}}{\text{To ta l} \quad \text{op er at in g} \quad \text{in co me}}

$$

$$

\text{Pr ov is io nf or lo an lo ss ra ti o (ra ti o1 0)} = \frac{\text{Pr ov is io nf or lo an lo ss es}}{\text{To ta lo pe ra ti ng in co me}}

$$

$$

\text{No ni nt er es t} \quad \text{ex pe ns e} \quad \text{ra ti o} \quad (1 1) = \frac{\text{No ni nt er es t} \quad \text{ex pe ns e}}{\text{To ta l} \quad \text{op er at in g} \quad \text{in co me}}

$$

$$

\text{Ta xr at io (ra ti o1 2)} = \frac{\text{In co me ta xe s}}{\text{To ta lo pe ra ti ng in co me}}

$$

These ratios measure the proportion of total operating income that goes to pay the particular expense item. The values of these ratios for Heartland Bank and Trust and Bank of America are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Heartland</td><td>Bank of America</td></tr><tr><td>Interest expense ratio</td><td>6.558/132.902 + 24.430 = 4.17\%</td><td>9,620/61,192 + 25,874 = 11.05\%</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for loan loss ratio</td><td>6.000/132.902 + 24.430 = 3.81\%</td><td>3,762/61,192 + 25,874 = 4.32\%</td></tr><tr><td>Noninterest expense ratio</td><td>81.926/132.902 + 24.430 = 52.07\%</td><td>36,128/61,192 + 25,874 = 41.49\%</td></tr><tr><td>Tax ratio</td><td>1.058/132.902 + 24.430 = 0.67\%</td><td>7,894/61,192 + 25,874 = 9.07\%</td></tr></table>

The sum of the numerators of these four ratios subtracted from the denominator (total operating income) is the bank's net income.[16] Thus, the lower any of these ratios, the higher the bank's profitability (PM). As mentioned, however, although a low value for any of these ratios produces an increase in the bank's profit, it may be indicative of a problem situation in the bank. Thus, an even more detailed breakdown of these ratios may be warranted. For example, the interest expense ratio can be broken down according to the various interest expense-generating liabilities (ratios 13-20 in Table 12-6; e.g., interest on NOW accounts/total operating income). Additionally, the noninterest expense ratio may be broken down according to its components (ratios 21-23—e.g., salaries and employee benefits/total operating income). These ratios allow for a more detailed examination of the generation of the bank's expenses.

A different method to evaluate the bank's expense management is to calculate such ratios as deposit yields (ratios 24-31; e.g., interest expense on NOW accounts/dollar value of NOW accounts) or size of investment (e.g., dollar value of NOW accounts/total assets—ratios 32-44—or dollar value of NOW accounts/total interest-bearing liabilities—ratios 45-53). The noninterest expense items can be evaluated using component percentages (ratios 54-56; e.g., salaries and employee benefits/noninterest income) or size of expense (ratios 57-59; e.g., salaries and employee benefits/total assets).

Asset Utilization. The AU ratio measures the extent to which the bank's assets generate revenue. The breakdown of the AU ratio separates the total revenue generated into interest

The interest income and noninterest income ratios are not necessarily independent. For example, the bank's ability to generate loans affects both interest income and, through fees and service charges, noninterest income. High values for these ratios signify the efficient use of bank resources to generate income and are thus generally positive for the bank. But some problematic situations that result in high ratio values could exist. For example, a bank that replaces low-risk, low-return loans with high-risk, high-return loans will experience an increase in its interest income ratio. However, high-risk loans have a higher default probability, which could result in the ultimate loss of both interest and principal payments. Further breakdown of these ratios is therefore a valuable tool in the financial performance evaluation process.


The interest income ratio can be broken down using the various components of interest income (ratios 62-72; e.g., income on C&I loans/total assets); or by using asset yields (ratios 73-83; e.g., income on C&I loans/dollar value of C&I loans); or by using size of investment (e.g., dollar value of C&I loans/total assets—ratios 84-97—or dollar value of C&I loans/total earning assets—ratios 98-107). Off-balance-sheet activities can also be measured in terms of the size of the notional values they create in relation to bank assets (ratios 108-113—e.g., loan commitments/total assets). The noninterest income ratio can also be subdivided into the various subcategories (e.g., income from fiduciary activities/total assets—ratios 114-120—or income from fiduciary activities/noninterest income—ratios 121-127).

# Other Ratios

A number of other profit measures are commonly used to evaluate bank performance. Three of these are (1) the net interest margin, (2) the spread (ratio), and (3) overhead efficiency.

# net interest margin

Interest income minus interest expense divided by earning assets.

# spread

The difference between lending and borrowing rates.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

9. Why a high value of ROE may signal a risk problem for a bank?
10. What ratios ROA can be broken down into?
11. What the spread measure means?

# overhead efficiency

A bank's ability to generate noninterest income to cover noninterest expense.

Net Interest Margin. Net interest margin (ratio 6 in Table 12-5) measures the net return on the bank's earning assets (investment securities and loans and leases) and is defined as follows:

$$

\text{Ne ti nt er st ma rg in} = \frac{\text{Ne ti nt er st in co me}}{\text{Ea rn in ga ss et s}} = \frac{\text{In te rs ti nc om e} - \text{In te rs te xp en se}}{\text{In ve st me nt se cu ri ti es} + \text{Ne tl oa ns an dl ea se s}}

$$

Generally, the higher this ratio, the better. Suppose, however, that the preceding scenario (replacement of low-risk, low-return loans with high-risk, high-return loans) is the reason for the increase. This situation can increase risk for the bank. It highlights the fact that looking at returns without looking at risk can be misleading and potentially dangerous in terms of bank solvency and long-run profitability.

The Spread. The spread (ratio 7 in Table 12-5) measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and is thus another measure of return on the bank's assets. The spread is defined as:

$$

\text{Sp re ad} = \frac{\text{In te rs ti nc om e}}{\text{Ea rn in ga ss et s}} - \frac{\text{In te rs te xp en se}}{\text{In te rs t -b ea ri ng li ab il it ie s}}

$$

The higher the spread, the more profitable the bank, but again, the source of a high spread and the potential risk implications should be considered.

Overhead Efficiency. Overhead efficiency (ratio 8 in Table 12-5) measures the bank's ability to generate noninterest income to cover noninterest expenses. It is represented as:

$$

\text{Ov er he ad} = \frac{\text{No ni te re st in co me}}{\text{No ni te re st} \text{ex pe ns e}}

$$

In general, the higher this ratio, the better. However, because of the high levels of noninterest expense relative to noninterest income, overhead efficiency is rarely higher than 1 (or in percentage terms, 100 percent). Further, low operating expenses (and thus low noninterest expenses) can also indicate increased risk if the institution is not investing in the most efficient technology or its back office systems are poorly supported. The values of these ratios for the two banks are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Heartland</td><td>Bank of America</td></tr><tr><td>Net interest margin</td><td>126.344/609.303 + 2,048.486 = 4.75\%</td><td>51,572/451,770 + 954,804 = 3.67\%</td></tr><tr><td>Spread</td><td>132.902/2,657.798 - 6.558/2,263.686 = 4.71\%</td><td>61,192/1,406,574 - 9,620/1,378,960 = 3.65\%</td></tr><tr><td>Overhead efficiency</td><td>24.430/81.926 = 29.82\%</td><td>25,874/36,128 = 71.62\%</td></tr></table>

# IMPACT OF MARKET NICHE AND BANK SIZE ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

# Impact of a Bank's Market Niche

As mentioned earlier, based on 2019 data, Heartland Bank and Trust is a profitable and efficient community bank that invests mainly in agriculture, real estate loans, and commercial and industrial loans, and uses low-cost funding methods. Bank of America, on the other hand, operates with a larger and more balanced portfolio of assets and liabilities across both wholesale and retail banking. Keeping the more specialized market niche of Heartland Bank and Trust in mind, let us make a comparative financial analysis using the ROE framework and the banks' 2019 financial statements.

ROE and Its Components. As stated, the ROE (ratio 1) of 18.46 percent for Heartland Bank and Trust (HBT) was higher than the 13.82 percent ROE reported for Bank of America (BOA). The breakdown of ROE indicates that HBT's greater profitability was due to its ROA of 2.17 percent compared with that of 1.64 percent for BOA (ratio 2). However, HBT's equity multiplier or leverage (ratio 3) was higher than that of BOA. HBT's EM of  $8.52 \times$  translated to an equity-to-asset ratio  $(= 1 / \mathrm{EM})$  of 11.74 percent, and BOA's EM of  $8.42 \times$  translated to an equity-to-asset ratio of 11.88 percent. Thus, although both banks appeared to be well capitalized, HBT had less equity.

The more focused orientation of HBT relative to BOA can best be seen by looking at the composition of the asset, and particularly the loan, portfolios (ratios 84 through 97 in Table 12-7) and the liabilities (ratios 32 through 44 in Table 12-6) of the two banks. HBT held 55.42 percent of its total assets in the form of real estate loans. Thus, consistent with its niche, a large majority of HBT's assets were tied up in real estate-related assets. BOA, on the other hand, had its asset investments more evenly distributed: 16.06 percent in C&I loans, 18.94 percent in real estate loans, 9.25 percent in consumer loans, and 7.80 percent in other loans.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, HBT issued mainly retail-oriented deposits: demand deposits were 7.86 percent, MMDAs were 15.80 percent, other savings were 44.49 percent, and retail CDs were 7.91 percent of total assets. BOA again used a broader array of deposits: demand deposits were 10.19 percent, MMDAs were 31.08 percent, other savings were 26.58 percent, foreign deposits were 4.84 percent, and retail CDs were 1.18 percent of total assets. HBT has specialized its service in the retail area, while BOA offers a broader spectrum of financial services.

# Impact of Size on Financial Statement Analysis

Bank size has traditionally affected the financial ratios of commercial banks, resulting in significant differences across size groups. Large banks' relatively easy access to purchased funds and capital markets compared to small banks' access is a reason for many of these differences. For example, large banks with easier access to capital markets generally operate with lower amounts of equity capital than do small banks. Also, large banks generally use more purchased funds (such as fed funds and RPs) and fewer core deposits than do small banks. Large banks tend to put more into salaries, premises, and other expenses than small banks, and they tend to diversify their operations and services more than small

banks. Large banks also generate more noninterest income (i.e., trading account, derivative security, and foreign trading income) than small banks and when risky loans pay off, they earn more interest income. As a result, although large banks tend to hold less equity than small banks, large banks do not necessarily return more on their assets. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that ROA consistently increased for banks grouped by size up to  \$15 billion in total assets, but decreased for banks with more than\$ 15 billion.

Examining ratios for the relatively large Bank of America (BOA) compared to the smaller Heartland Bank and Trust (HBT), we see only some of these size-related effects on accounting ratios. Looking at ROA (ratio 2 in Table 12-5), HBT is the more profitable overall of the two banks. Notice that HBT is producing the higher income per dollar of total operating income (ratio 4; PM for  $\mathrm{HBT} = 39.38$  percent and for  $\mathrm{BOA} = 34.07$  percent). Further, BOA is producing lower operating income per dollar of assets (AU for  $\mathrm{BOA} = 4.82$  percent and for  $\mathrm{HBT} = 5.50$  percent). The generation of total operating income in the form of interest income (ratio 60 in Table 12-7) is smaller for BOA (interest income ratio for  $\mathrm{BOA} = 3.39$  percent and for  $\mathrm{HBT} = 4.65$  percent). We do see that BOA generates more noninterest income (1.43 percent of total assets) than HBT (0.85 percent of total assets; see ratio 61 in Table 12-7). This is likely due to BOA's relatively large amount of off-balance-sheet activities (which is typical of large banks compared with small banks). Indeed, the notional or face value of BOA's OBS activities is 1,314.71 percent of its assets on balance sheet compared to HBT's 25.39 percent (see ratios 108 through 113 in Table 12-7). Notice, too, that BOA's other assets (ratio 97 in Table 12-7) are 13.21 percent of total assets, compared with 4.28 percent for HBT. BOA also uses more purchased funds to total assets than HBT (8.04 percent versus 5.19 percent, respectively) and fewer core deposits (78.49 percent versus 81.86 percent, respectively) (see ratios 43 and 38 in Table 12-6). Finally and atypically, notice that BOA is financing its assets with more equity than HBT. The equity multiplier (ratio 3 in Table 12-5) for BOA,  $8.42\times$ , translates to an equity ratio of 11.88 percent, while that for HBT,  $8.52\times$ , translates to an equity ratio of 11.74 percent. Also uncharacteristically, BOA's ROE (ratio 1 in Table 12-5) is smaller than that of HBT (13.82 percent versus 18.46 percent).

# SUMMARY

This chapter analyzed the financial statements of commercial banks. The assets, liabilities, and equity capital were described as they appear in the balance sheet. The financial statements of other FIs such as savings banks and credit unions take a similar form. The income and expenses were described as they appear in the income statement. From the items on the financial statements, the profitability of two banks was analyzed using a return on equity (ROE) framework. What might appear as a favorable sign of profitability and performance can sometimes, in fact, indicate risk problems that management should address. Many problems and areas of managerial concern can be identified by performing a detailed breakdown of the financial ratios of banks. Thus, both profitability and risk management are interlinked and should be of concern to managers. The various risks to which FIs are exposed are examined in more detail in the next several chapters.

# SPECIALNESS AND REGULATION: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Chapter 1 showed that FIs are special because they provide vital services to various important sectors of the economy, such as information services, liquidity services, and price-risk reduction services. Failure to provide these services or a breakdown in their efficient provision can be costly to both the ultimate providers (households) and users (firms) of funds. The financial crisis of the late 2000s is a prime example of how such a breakdown in the provision of financial services can cripple financial markets worldwide and bring the world economy into a deep recession. Because of the vital nature of the services they provide, commercial banks (CBs) are regulated at the federal level (and sometimes at the state level) to protect against a disruption in the provision of these services and the cost this would impose on the economy and society at large. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the regulations imposed on CBs. We first discuss the history of commercial banks' regulation and then review the specific balance sheet regulations under which commercial banks operate. We also highlight differences in regulations imposed on domestic versus international commercial banks.
