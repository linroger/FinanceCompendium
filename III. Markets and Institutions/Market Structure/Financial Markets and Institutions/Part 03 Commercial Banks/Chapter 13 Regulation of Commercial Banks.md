# TYPES OF REGULATIONS AND THE REGULATORS

# LG 13-1

Six types of regulations seek to enhance the net social benefits of commercial banks' services to the economy: (1) safety and soundness regulation, (2) monetary policy regulation, (3) credit allocation regulation, (4) consumer protection regulation, (5) investor protection regulation, and (6) entry and chartering regulation. These regulations are summarized in Table 13-1. Regulations can be imposed at the federal or the state level and occasionally at the international level, as in the case of bank capital requirements.

# Safety and Soundness Regulation

To protect depositors and borrowers against the risk of CB failure—for example, due to a lack of diversification in asset portfolios—regulators have developed layers of protective mechanisms that balance a CB's profitability against its solvency, liquidity, and other types of risk (see Chapter 20). They are illustrated in Figure 13-1. These mechanisms are intended to ensure the safety and soundness of the CB and thus to maintain the credibility of the CB in the eyes of its borrowers and lenders. Indeed, even during the worst of the financial crisis, deposit runs at banks, savings institutions, and credit unions did not occur. This is because the safety and soundness regulations in place protected virtually all depositors from losing their money. Thus, while depository institution failures increased significantly during the crisis, depositors felt little need to run. Included in these mechanisms are requirements encouraging CBs to diversify their assets (the first layer of protection). The most obvious way to prevent CB failure is to prevent CBs from investing in an asset portfolio that produces cash flows that are insufficient to make the promised payments to the CB's liability

# TABLE 13-1 Areas of CB Specialness in Regulation

Safety and soundness regulation—layers of regulation have been imposed on CBs to protect depositors and borrowers against the risk of failure.

Monetary policy regulation—regulators control and implement monetary policy by requiring minimum levels of cash reserves to be held against commercial bank deposits.

Credit allocation regulation—regulations support the CB's lending to socially important sectors such as housing and farming.

Consumer protection regulation—regulations are imposed to prevent the CB from discriminating unfairly in lending.

Investor protection regulation—laws protect investors who directly purchase securities and/or indirectly purchase securities by investing in mutual or pension funds managed directly or indirectly by CBs (as well as other FIs).

Entry and chartering regulation—entry and activity regulations limit the number of CBs in any given financial services sector, thus impacting the charter values of CBs operating in that sector.

holders. Thus, banks are prohibited from making loans exceeding 15 percent of their own equity capital funds to any one company or borrower. A bank that has 10 percent of its assets funded by its own capital (and therefore 90 percent by liabilities) can lend no more than 1.5 percent of its assets to any one borrower (i.e., 15 percent of 10 percent). Although these regulations may result in lower profitability, they also lower credit and liquidity risk and ultimately lower the risk of insolvency.

The second layer of protection concerns the minimum level of stockholder capital or equity funds that the owners of a CB need to contribute to the funding of its operations. For example, bank (and thrift) regulators are concerned with the minimum ratio of capital to (risk) assets. The higher the proportion of capital contributed by owners, the greater the protection against insolvency risk for liability claimholders such as depositors. This occurs because losses on the asset portfolio due, for example, to loan defaults are legally borne by the stockholders first and then, only after the equity holders' claims are totally wiped out, by outside liability holders. For example, in 2008 the near failure of Washington Mutual and its subsequent purchase by JPMorgan Chase left Washington Mutual equity holders with very little. Consequently, CB regulators can directly affect the degree of risk exposure faced by nonequity claimholders in CBs (such as depositors) by varying the minimum amount of equity capital required to operate and keep a bank open (see discussions below). Indeed, part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008-2009 was the Capital Purchase Program (CPP). The goal of the CPP was to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. Further, regulators acted quickly to ensure the largest depository institutions (DIs) had sufficient capital to withstand large losses during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

The third layer of protection is the provision of guarantee funds such as the Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF) for banks. Deposit insurance mitigates a rational incentive depositors otherwise have to withdraw their funds at the first hint of trouble. By protecting CB depositors when a CB collapses and owners' equity or net worth is wiped out, a demand for regulation of insured institutions is created so as to protect the funds' (and taxpayers') resources. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) monitors and regulates participants in the DIF in return for providing explicit deposit guarantees of up to 250,000 per depositor per bank. Major reforms of FDIC insurance of CB deposits have recently been adopted. We discuss these below.

The fourth layer of regulation involves monitoring and surveillance. Regulators subject all CBs to varying degrees of monitoring and surveillance. This involves on-site examination of the CB by regulators as well as the CB's production of accounting statements and reports on a timely basis for off-site evaluation. Just as savers appoint CBs as delegated monitors to evaluate the behavior and actions of ultimate borrowers, society (through policy and appointments determined by the U.S. government) assigns regulators to monitor the behavior and performance of CBs. Many of the regulatory changes proposed in reaction to the financial crisis included significant increases in the monitoring and surveillance of any financial institution whose failure could have serious systemic effects.

Finally, note that regulation is not without costs for those regulated. For example, regulators may require CBs to have more equity capital than private owners believe is in their own best interests. Similarly, producing the information requested by regulators is costly for CBs because it involves the time of managers, lawyers, and accountants. Again, the socially optimal amount of information may differ from a CB's privately optimal amount. Although regulation may be socially beneficial, it imposes private costs, or a regulatory burden, on individual CB owners and managers. Consequently, regulation attempts to enhance the social welfare benefits and mitigate the social costs of providing CB services. The difference between the private benefits to a CB from being regulated—such as insurance fund guarantees—and the private costs it faces from adhering to regulation—such as examinations—is called its net regulatory burden. The higher the net regulatory burden on CBs, the smaller are the benefits of being regulated compared to the costs of adhering to regulations from a private (CB) owner's perspective.

In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which sought to prevent a repeat of the market meltdown of 2008 and promote the safety and soundness of the financial system. Touted as the most extensive proposal for the overhaul of financial rules since the Great Depression, this bill proposed a sweeping revision of the nation's financial system and the rules that govern it. The bill set forth reforms to meet five key objectives:

1. Promote robust supervision and regulation of financial firms by establishing (a) a new Financial Services Oversight Council of financial regulators (chaired by the Treasury and including the heads of the principal federal financial regulators as members) to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; (b) a new authority for the Federal Reserve to supervise all firms that could pose a threat to financial stability, even those that do not own banks; (c) stronger capital and other prudential standards for all financial firms, and even higher standards for large, interconnected firms; (d) a new National Bank Supervisor to supervise all federally chartered banks; (e) the elimination of the federal thrift charter for thrifts not dedicated to mortgage lending and other loopholes that allowed some depository institutions to avoid bank holding company regulation by the Federal Reserve; and (f) the registration of advisors of hedge funds and other private pools of capital with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
2. Establish comprehensive supervision of financial markets by establishing (a) the regulation of securitization markets, including new requirements for market transparency, stronger regulation of credit rating agencies, and a requirement that issuers and originators retain a financial interest in securitized loans; (b) comprehensive regulation of all over-the-counter derivatives; and (c) new authority for the Federal Reserve to oversee payment, clearing, and settlement systems.
3. Protect consumers and investors from financial abuse by establishing (a) a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers across the financial sector from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices; (b) stronger regulations to improve the transparency, fairness, and appropriateness of consumer and investor products and services; and (c) a level playing field and higher standards for providers of consumer financial products and services, whether or not they are part of a bank.
4. Provide the government with the tools it needs to manage financial crises by establishing (a) a new regime to resolve crises involving nonbank financial institutions whose failure could have serious systemic effects and (b) revisions to the Federal Reserve's emergency lending authority to improve accountability.
5. Raise international regulatory standards and improve international cooperation by establishing international reforms to support efforts in the United States, including strengthening the capital framework, improving oversight of global financial markets, coordinating the supervision of internationally active firms, and enhancing crisis management tools.

Regulators have utilized the new authority given to them. For example, as part of the increased authority given to the Federal Reserve in the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Fed proposed in late 2011 that net credit exposures between any two of the nation's six largest financial firms would be limited to 10 percent of the company's regulatory capital. Other financial firms would be subject to the 25 percent limit required by the 2010 act. The proposed Fed rule aimed to reduce the interconnectedness of financial institutions in the U.S. financial system and reduce the ability of any single financial firm to damage the financial system and the broader economy—as happened when Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail.

However, six years after the passage of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, only about 70 percent of the rules required by the act had been written into law. As of July 2016, of the 390 total rulemaking requirements, 274 (70.3 percent) had been met with finalized rules, 36 (9.2 percent) had been proposed that would meet requirements, and 80 (20.5 percent) had yet seen a proposal to meet rulemaking requirements. Soon after taking office in January 2017, President Trump pledged to dismantle the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection (Dodd-Frank) Act. To deliver on this

promise, House Republicans passed the Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs (CHOICE) Act in May 2017. The CHOICE Act was meant to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank Act, but the core of the legislation was rejected by the Senate. On May 22, 2018, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, a partial rollback of some of the Dodd-Frank rules.

# Monetary Policy Regulation

Another motivation for regulation concerns the special role that banks play in the transmission of monetary policy from the Federal Reserve (the central bank) to the rest of the economy. The central bank directly controls only the quantity of notes and coin in the economy—called outside money—whereas the bulk of the money supply is bank deposits—called inside money. Regulators commonly impose a minimum level of required cash reserves to be held against deposits, or inside money (discussed below). Some argue that imposing such reserve requirements makes the control of the money supply and its transmission more predictable. Such reserves add to a CB's net regulatory burden if they are more than the institution believes are necessary for its own liquidity purposes. In general, all CBs would choose to hold some cash reserves—even noninterest bearing—to meet the liquidity and transaction needs of their customers directly. For well-managed CBs, however, this optimal level is normally low, especially if the central bank (or other regulatory body) pays little or no interest on required reserves. As a result, CBs often view required reserves as similar to a tax and as a positive cost of undertaking financial intermediation.

# Credit Allocation Regulation

Credit allocation regulation supports the CB's lending to socially important sectors such as housing and farming. These regulations may require a CB to hold a minimum amount of assets in one particular sector of the economy or to set maximum interest rates, prices, or fees to subsidize certain sectors. An example of asset restrictions includes the qualified thrift lender (QTL) test, which requires savings institutions to hold 65 percent of their assets in residential mortgage-related assets to retain a thrift charter. Examples of interest rate restrictions are the usury laws that many states set on the maximum rates that can be charged on mortgages and/or consumer loans and regulations (now abolished) such as the Federal Reserve Bank's Regulation Q maximums on time and savings deposit interest rates.

Such price and quantity restrictions may have justification on social welfare grounds—especially if society has a preference for strong (and subsidized) housing and farming sectors. However, they can also be harmful to FIs that have to bear the private costs of meeting many of these regulations. To the extent that the net private costs of such restrictions are positive, they add to the costs and reduce the efficiency with which FIs undertake intermediation.

# Consumer Protection Regulation

Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977 and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) in 1975 to prevent discrimination by lending institutions. HMDA is especially concerned about discrimination on the basis of age, race, sex, or income. Since 1990, examinations for bank compliance with the CRA have become increasingly rigorous. Institutions have been required to disclose publicly their CRA ratings (from outstanding to substantial noncompliance). Since 1992, CBs have had to submit reports to regulators summarizing their lending on a geographic basis, showing the relationship between the demographic area to which they are lending and the demographic data (such as income and percentage of minority population) for that location. Commercial banks also must now report to their chief federal regulator the reasons that they granted or denied credit. Many analysts believed that community and consumer protection laws were imposing a considerable net regulatory burden on CBs without offsetting social benefits that enhance equal access to mortgage and lending markets. In 1995 CRA regulations were revised to make assessments more performance based, more objective, and less burdensome for covered institutions.

A new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect consumers across the financial sector from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices was part of the financial services overhaul bill passed by the U.S. Congress in July 2010. An example of the CFPB oversight occurred in September 2016 when Wells Fargo Bank was ordered to pay 185 million in fines and penalties (the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed) to settle what the CFPB called "the widespread illegal practice of secretly opening unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts." Investigators found that Wells Fargo employees opened deposit and credit card accounts without consent from consumers. Employees would then transfer funds from the consumers' legitimate accounts temporarily into the new, unauthorized accounts. Wells Fargo employees even went as far as secretly creating PINs and false e-mail and phone addresses for unauthorized deposit accounts. This widespread practice gave the employees credit for opening the new accounts, allowing them to earn additional compensation and to meet the bank's sales goals. Consumers, in turn, were sometimes harmed when the bank charged them for insufficient funds or overdraft fees because the money was not in their original accounts. The unauthorized credit cards also came with annual fees and other charges. The CFPB said that Wells Fargo employees applied for roughly 565,000 credit cards and 1.5 million deposit accounts that may have not been authorized by consumers.

Further, a new credit card reform bill, effective in 2010, put unprecedented restrictions on the actions that may be taken by all credit card issuers against credit card holders. Included in the bill were limits on allowable interest rate increases during the first year, limits on fees and penalties credit card companies may charge, protection against arbitrary interest rate increases, provisions giving credit card holders sufficient time to pay their bills, and the abolition of universal default (a practice in which a credit card issuer would raise the interest rate on a customer's account in response to the customer's actions related to other accounts; for example, missing a payment on a utility bill would result in an increase in a credit card rate).

# Investor Protection Regulation

A considerable number of laws protect investors who use commercial banks directly to purchase securities and/or indirectly to access securities markets through investing in mutual or pension funds managed by CBs. Various laws protect investors against abuses such as insider trading, lack of disclosure, outright malfeasance, and breach of fiduciary responsibilities. Important legislation affecting investment banks and mutual funds includes the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since CBs are increasingly moving into offering investment banking and mutual fund services following the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999, these restrictions will increasingly impact their profits. As with consumer protection legislation, compliance with these acts can impose a net regulatory burden on CBs.

An example of investor protection occurred in 2016, when the Labor Department issued new conflict-of-interest rules that require financial advisors handling individual retirement and  $401(\mathrm{k})$  accounts to act in the best interests of their clients. Prior to the passage of this rule, financial advisors were generally required only to recommend "suitable" investments, which meant that they could direct a client toward a more expensive mutual fund that paid a higher commission when an otherwise identical, cheaper fund would have been an equal or better alternative. The government move was expected to encourage a shift of retirement funds into lower-cost investments. It was estimated that conflicts of interest embedded in the way many investment professionals did business cost investors about 17 billion a year, leading to annual returns that were about 1 percentage point lower.

# Entry and Chartering Regulation

Entry into the commercial banking industry is regulated, as are activities once a CB has been established. Increasing or decreasing the cost of entry into a financial sector affects the profitability of firms already competing in that industry. Thus, the industries heavily protected against new entrants by high direct costs (e.g., through capital requirements) and

www.federalreserve.gov high indirect costs (e.g., by restricting the type of individuals who can establish CBs) of entry produce larger profits for existing firms than those in which entry is relatively easy. In addition, regulations define the scope of permitted activities under a given charter. For example, current regulations allow commercial banks to perform activities traditionally performed only by insurance companies and investment banks. The broader the set of financial service activities permitted under a charter, the more valuable that charter is likely to be. Thus, barriers to entry and regulations pertaining to the scope of permitted activities affect a CB's charter value and the size of its net regulatory burden.

# Regulators

Regulators are responsible for ensuring that CBs are operating in accordance with the regulations discussed above and that the vital services provided by these institutions are carried out safely in a sound and efficient manner. While (like auditors) regulators must analyze and evaluate the business of the CBs they monitor, they do so with special attention to a CB's ability to provide social benefits to the overall economy. Unlike other countries that have one or sometimes two regulators, U.S. commercial banks may be subject to the supervision and regulations of as many as four separate regulators. The key regulators for commercial banks were discussed in Chapter 11. They include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve (FR), and state bank regulators. Appendix 13C to this chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor) lists the regulators that oversee the various activities of commercial banks (as well as savings institutions and credit unions [discussed in Chapter 14]).

In the sections that follow, we describe four facets of the regulatory structure: (1) regulation of the overall operations, (2) regulation of product and geographic expansion, (3) the provision and regulation of deposit insurance, and (4) balance sheet regulations (reserve requirements and capital regulations).

Historically, commercial banks have been among the most regulated firms in the United States. Because of the inherent special nature of banking and banking contracts, regulators have imposed numerous restrictions on their products and geographic activities. Table 13-2 lists the major laws, from the McFadden Act of 1927 to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, and briefly describes the key features of each act.

# Product Segmentation in the U.S. Commercial Banking Industry

The U.S. financial system has traditionally been segmented along product lines. Regulatory barriers and restrictions have often inhibited a commercial bank's ability to operate in some areas of the financial services industry and expand its product set beyond some limited range. Commercial banks operating in the United States can be compared with those operating in Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, where a more universal FI structure allows individual financial services organizations to offer a far broader range of banking, insurance, securities, and other financial services products.

Commercial and Investment Banking Activities. The United States has experienced several phases of regulating the links between the commercial and investment banking industries. Simply defined, commercial banking is the activity of deposit taking and commercial lending; investment banking is the activity of underwriting, issuing, and distributing (via public or private placement) securities.

After the 1929 stock market crash, the United States entered a major recession, and approximately 10,000 banks failed between 1930 and 1933. A commission of inquiry (the Pecora Commission) established in 1932 began investigating the causes of the crash. Its findings included concerns about the riskiness and conflicts of interest that arise when commercial and investment banking activities are linked (affiliated) in one organization. This resulted in new

legislation, the 1933 Banking Act, or the Glass-Steagall Act. The Glass-Steagall Act sought to impose a rigid separation (or nonaffiliation) between commercial banking—taking deposits and making commercial loans—and investment banking—underwriting, issuing, and distributing stocks, bonds, and other securities. The act defined three major exemptions to this separation. First, banks were allowed to continue to underwrite new issues of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Second, banks were allowed to continue underwriting municipal general obligation (GO) bonds. Third, banks were allowed to continue engaging in private placements (see Chapter 6) of all types of bonds and equities, corporate and noncorporate.

For most of the 1933-1963 period, commercial banks and investment banks generally appeared to be willing to abide by both the letter and spirit of the Glass-Steagall Act. Between 1963 and 1987, however, banks challenged restrictions on their municipal revenue bond underwriting activities, commercial paper underwriting activities, discount brokerage activities, and advising activities, including openand closed-end mutual funds,

# Section 20 affiliate

the underwriting of mortgage-backed securities, and selling annuities.2 In most cases, the courts eventually permitted these activities for commercial banks.

With this onslaught, and the de facto erosion of the Glass-Steagall Act by legal interpretation, the Federal Reserve Board in April 1987 allowed commercial bank holding companies such as J. P. Morgan & Company (now JPMorgan Chase), the parent of Morgan Guarantee Trust Company (a commercial bank), to establish separate Section 20 securities affiliates as investment banks. Through these Section 20 affiliates, banks began to conduct all their "ineligible" or "gray area" securities activities, such as commercial paper underwriting, mortgage-backed securities underwriting, and municipal revenue bond underwriting. Note the organizational structure of Citigroup Corp., its bank, and its Section 20 subsidiary (or investment bank) Smith Barney in Figure 13-2. These Section 20 subsidiaries did not violate Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which restricted affiliations of commercial banks and investment banks, since the revenue generated from securities underwriting activities amounted to less than 5 percent (increased later to 10 percent and then 25 percent) of the total revenues generated. As a result of more recent regulations, discussed next, Section 20 subsidiaries are now virtually nonexistent.

Significant changes occurred in 1997 as the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took actions to expand bank holding companies' permitted activities. In particular, the Federal Reserve allowed commercial banks to acquire directly existing investment banks rather than establish completely new Section 20 investment banking subsidiaries. The result was a number of mergers and acquisitions between commercial and investment banks in 1997 through 2000. Two of the largest mergers prior to those completed during the financial crisis (see below) included Citicorp's  \$83 billion merger with Travelers Group (which owned Smith Barney and Salomon Brothers) in April 1998 and Bank of New York's 2007 purchase of Mellon Financial for\$ 16.5 billion. In each case, the banks stated that one motivation for their acquisition was the desire to establish a presence in the securities business since laws separating investment and commercial banking were changing. Also noted as a motivation in these acquisitions was the opportunity to expand business lines, take advantage of economies of scale and scope to reduce overall costs, and merge the customer bases of the respective commercial and investment banks involved in the acquisition.[5]

2. Municipal revenue bonds are riskier than municipal GO bonds since their interest and principal are guaranteed only by the revenue from the projects they finance. One example is the revenue from road tolls of a bond funding the construction of a new section of highway (see Chapter 6).

4. Legally, as long as less than 50 percent of the affiliate's revenues could be attributable to "ineligible activities," it could not be argued that the affiliate was "principally engaged in such activities." Therefore, an affiliate could not be viewed as violating Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
5. The erosion of the product barriers between the commercial and investment banking industries has not been all one way. Large investment banks such as Merrill Lynch have increasingly sought to offer banking products. For example, in the late 1970s, Merrill Lynch created the cash management account (CMA), which allowed investors to own a money market mutual fund with check-writing privileges into which bond and stock sale proceeds could be swept on a daily basis. This account allows the investor to earn interest on cash held in a brokerage account. In addition, investment banks have been major participants as traders and investors in the secondary market for loans to less-developed countries and other loans.

In 1999, after years of "homemade" deregulation by banks and securities firms, the U.S. Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act (FSMA), which repealed the Glass-Steagall barriers between commercial banking and investment banking. The bill, touted as the biggest change in the regulation of financial institutions in nearly 70 years, allowed for the creation of a "financial services holding company" that could engage in banking activities and securities underwriting. The bill also allowed large national banks to place certain activities, including some securities underwritings, in direct bank subsidiaries regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Thus, after nearly 70 years of partial or complete separation between investment banking and commercial banking, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 opened the door for the creation of full-service financial institutions in the United States similar to those that existed in the United States pre-1933 and that exist in many other countries today.

After passage of the FSMA, the two industries came together to a degree. Commercial banks like Bank of America and Wachovia tried to build up their own investment-banking operations, but they did not have much success in eating into the core franchises of the then five big independent investment banks: Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns. Generally, the investment banks, which were not subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and did not have to adhere to as strict capital requirements, remained the major investment banking financial institutions. However, the financial crisis changed the landscape dramatically. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve helped JPMorgan acquire Bear Stearns as the investment bank faced bankruptcy. This was seen as a controversial decision and cost the Federal Reserve 30 billion. However, the Fed defended the move as essential. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail and Merrill Lynch was purchased by Bank of America.

Of the five major independent investment banks that existed a year earlier, only two—Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—remained. Even Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were facing a severe liquidity crisis during the weekend of September 20–21, 2008. To address the crisis, one week after the closure of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, the Federal Reserve granted a request by the last two major investment banks to change their status to bank holding companies. By becoming bank holding companies, the firms agreed to significantly tighter regulations and much closer supervision by bank examiners from several government agencies rather than only the Securities and Exchange Commission. With the conversion, the investment banks would look more like commercial banks, with more disclosure, higher capital reserves, and less risk taking. In exchange for subjecting themselves to more regulation, the companies would have access to the full array of the Federal Reserve's lending facilities. For example, as bank holding companies, Morgan and Goldman would have greater access to the discount window of the Federal Reserve, which banks can use to borrow money from the central bank. While they were allowed to draw on temporary Fed lending facilities early in the financial crisis, they could not borrow against the same wide array of collateral that commercial banks could. Further, as commercial banks, Morgan and Goldman had enhanced potential access to TARP money. These events on Wall Street—the failure or sale of three of the five largest independent investment banks and the conversion of the two remaining firms from investment banks to commercial banks—effectively turned back the clock to the 1920s, when investment banks and commercial banks functioned under the same corporate umbrella.

As part of the increased authority given to the Federal Reserve in the 2010, part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is the Volcker Rule, which prohibits U.S. depository institutions (DIs) from engaging in proprietary trading (i.e., trading as a principal for the trading account of the bank). Thus, only the investment banking arm of the business is allowed to conduct such trading. The Volcker Rule was implemented in April 2014 and banks had until July 21, 2015, to be in compliance. The result of the new rules is that big U.S. banks could be forced to return to a more traditional banking model that revolves around deposit taking and making loans. This could result in smaller capital markets and less securities lending. Indeed, since the implementation of the Volcker Rule, dealers regulated by the rule have decreased their corporate bond market-making activities. While dealers not affected by the Volcker Rule have stepped in to provide liquidity, the net effect is a less liquid corporate bond market.[6]

On July 9, 2019, the five federal financial regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the "Rule"). The Rule excludes from the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions community banks that have total assets equal to 10 billion or less and total trading assets and liabilities equal to 5 percent or less of total assets. The Rule is consistent with the statutory amendments made pursuant to sections of the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) and finalizes the changes as proposed in EGRRCPA.

Banking and Insurance. Certain insurance products—for example, credit life insurance, mortgage insurance, and auto insurance—tend to have natural synergistic links to bank lending. However, a distinction should be made between a bank selling insurance as an agent by selling other FIs' policies for a fee and a bank acting as an insurance underwriter and bearing the direct risk of underwriting losses itself. In general, the risks of insurance agency activities are quite low in loss potential when compared to insurance underwriting.

Prior to the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, banks were under stringent restrictions when selling and underwriting almost every type of insurance. Further, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 severely restricted insurance companies' ability to own, or to be affiliated with, full-service banks. A great challenge to these restrictions on bank-insurance company affiliations came from the 1998 merger between Citicorp and Travelers to create the largest financial services conglomerate in the United States. The primary activity of Travelers was insurance (life and property-casualty), while the primary activity of Citicorp was banking (both also were engaged in securities activities: Citicorp through its Section 20 subsidiary and Travelers through its earlier acquisition of Smith Barney and Salomon Brothers). The Federal Reserve gave initial approval in September 1998. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve had up to five years to formally approve the merger.

The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 completely changed the landscape for insurance activities as it allowed bank holding companies to open insurance underwriting affiliates and insurance companies to open commercial bank (or savings institutions) as well as securities firm affiliates through the creation of a financial service holding company. With the passage of this act banks no longer have to fight legal battles to overcome restrictions on their ability to sell insurance. The insurance industry also applauded the act, as it forced banks that underwrite and sell insurance to operate under the same set of state regulations (pertaining to their insurance lines) as insurance companies operating in that state. Under the new act, a financial services holding company that engages in commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance activities is functionally regulated. This means that the holding company's banking activities are regulated by bank regulators (such as the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC), its securities activities are regulated by the SEC, and its insurance activities are regulated by up to 50 state insurance regulators. Further, in July 2010, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established a new office at the Treasury (the Office of National Insurance) that monitors the insurance industry and helps decide if an insurer is big enough to warrant tighter oversight. The act also established a Financial Stability Oversight Council that has authority to review both banks and nonbank companies, including insurance companies, to see if they pose a threat to the overall financial system.

Commercial Banking and Commerce. Although the direct holdings of other firms' equity by national banks has been constrained since 1863, the restrictions on the commercial activities of bank holding companies are a more recent phenomena. In particular, the 1970 amendments to the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act required bank holding companies to divest themselves of nonbank-related subsidiaries over a 10-year period

following the amendment. $^{7}$  The 1956 Bank Holding Company Act also effectively restricted acquisitions of banks by commercial firms (as was true for insurance companies before 1999). The major vehicle for a commercial firm's entry into commercial banking has been through nonbank banks (such as EnerBank USA owned by Home Depot) or nonbank financial service firms that offer banking-type services by divesting a subsidiary "bank" of its commercial loans and/or its demand deposits (as well as any deposit insurance coverage).

The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 changed restrictions on ownership limits imposed on financial services holding companies. Commercial banks belonging to a financial service holding company can now take a controlling interest in a nonfinancial enterprise provided that two conditions are met. First, the investment cannot be made for an indefinite period of time. The act did not provide an explicit time limit, but simply states that the investment can be "held for a period of time to enable the sale or disposition thereof on a reasonable basis consistent with the financial viability of the [investment]." Second, the bank cannot become actively involved in the management of the corporation in which it invests. Nevertheless, corporate stocks or equities are still conspicuously absent from most bank balance sheets (see Chapter 12).

Nonbank Financial Service Firms and Banking. In comparison with the barriers separating banking and either securities, insurance, or commercial sector activities, the barriers among nonbank financial service firms and banking are generally much weaker. Indeed, the erosion of product barriers between commercial banks and other financial institution services firms has not been all one way. Nonbank financial service firms increasingly offer traditional banking services. For example, money market mutual funds offer checking account-like deposit services, annuities are financial products issued by insurance companies that offer many of the features of CDs, and finance companies and industrial loan corporations (see Chapter 11) provide commercial, real estate, and consumer loans that compete directly with the same services offered by commercial banks. These financial institutions provide credit, maturity, and liquidity intermediation without access to central bank liquidity provisions or deposit insurance.[8] Their activities occur beyond the reach of existing state and federal monitoring and regulation.

More recently the activities of nonfinancial service firms that perform banking services have been termed shadow banking. Beyond the examples listed previously, new participants in the shadow banking system include structured investment vehicles (SIVs), special purpose vehicles (SPVs), asset-backed paper vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose finance companies, and credit hedge funds. A January 2020 report from the U.S. Financial Stability Board (FSB) put assets of shadow banks worldwide at 114 trillion, at the end of 2018. Based on the FSB data, total assets of these nonbank financial intermediaries amount to approximately 133 percent of global GDP and approximately 30 percent of global financial assets. The euro area has the highest share of shadow banking assets (32 percent), the United States has the second highest (26 percent), China has the third highest (10 percent), the UK has fourth highest (9 percent), and the Cayman Islands has the fifth highest share (6 percent). In several jurisdictions, shadow banking sectors are very large compared to their GDP. For example, shadow banking assets were 1,485 times GDP in the Cayman Islands and, within the euro area, 236 times GDP in Luxembourg, 13 times GDP in Ireland, and seven times GDP in the Netherlands.

In the shadow banking system, savers place their funds with money market mutual and similar funds, which invest these funds in the liabilities of shadow banks. Borrowers get loans and leases from shadow banks such as finance companies rather than from banks. Like the traditional banking system, the shadow banking system intermediates the flow of funds between net savers and net borrowers. However, instead of the bank serving as the intermediary, it is the nonbank financial service firm, or shadow bank, that intermediates. Further, unlike the traditional banking system, where the complete credit intermediation is performed by a single bank, in the shadow banking system it is performed through a series of steps involving many nonbank financial service firms. For example, and as discussed in more detail in Chapter 25, the lending process might involve (1) loan originations performed by a finance company, (2) the purchase and warehousing of these loans conducted by single and multiple SIVs funded through asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), and (3) the purchase of ABCP by money market mutual funds. Thus, the shadow banking system decomposes the traditional process of deposit-funded, hold-to-maturity lending conducted by banks into a more complex, wholesale-funded, securitization-based lending process that involves multiple shadow banks which are not regulated by a specific regulatory body.

As of December 2019, these shadow banks continue to be unregulated by the federal government. The 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act called for regulators to be given broad authority to monitor and regulate nonbank financial firms that pose risks to the financial system. On April 11, 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) issued a Final Rule and Interpretive Guidance regarding the manner in which the Council makes designations (to determine which nonbank financial companies should be subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve and prudential standards) under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. On November 17, 2017, the Department of the Treasury issued a report to the president in response to a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a thorough review of the determination and designation processes of the Council. In response, the Council proposed an interpretive guidance in March 2019 to revise and update the 2012 Interpretive Guidance. The Council intends to seek to identify, assess, and address potential risks and emerging threats on a systemwide basis by taking an activities-based approach to its work.

# Geographic Expansion in the U.S. Commercial Banking Industry

Geographic expansions can have a number of dimensions. In particular, they can be (1) domestic, (2) within a state or region, or (3) international (participating in a foreign market). Expansions can also be carried out by opening a new office or branch or by acquiring another bank. Historically, in the United States, the ability of commercial banks to expand domestically has been constrained by regulation. By comparison, no special regulations inhibit the ability of commercial firms such as General Motors, IBM, or Walmart from establishing new or de novo offices, factories, or stores anywhere in the country. Nor are such companies generally prohibited from acquiring other firms—as long as they are not banks. Commercial banks have faced a complex and changing network of rules and regulations covering geographic expansions. Such regulations may inhibit expansions, but they may also create potential opportunities to increase a commercial bank's returns. In particular, regulations may create locally uncompetitive markets with high economic rents that new entrants can potentially exploit. Thus, for the most innovative commercial banks, regulation can provide profit opportunities as well as costs. As a result, regulation acts both as an inhibitor and an incentive to engage in geographic expansions.

# Regulatory Factors Impacting Geographic Expansion.

Restrictions on Intrastate Banking by Commercial Banks. For most of the 1900s, most U.S. banks were unit banks with a single office. Improving communications and customer needs resulted in a rush to branching. This movement ran into increasing opposition from the smallest unit banks and the largest money center banks. The smallest unit banks perceived a competitive threat to their retail business from the larger branching banks; money center banks feared a loss of valuable correspondent business such as check-clearing and other payment services. As a result, several states restricted banks' ability to branch within the state. Indeed, some states prohibited intrastate (or within-state) branching per se, effectively constraining a bank to unit bank status. Over the years and in a very piecemeal fashion, states liberalized their restrictions on within-state branching. By 1994, only one state (Iowa) had not deregulated intrastate banking.

# de novo office

A newly established office.

# unit bank

# multibank holding company (MBHC)

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

10. The reason for the passage of the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act?
11. How the Riegle-Neal Act affected the geographic expansion opportunities of banks?

Restrictions on Interstate Banking by Commercial Banks. The defining piece of legislation affecting interstate branching up until 1994 was the McFadden Act, passed in 1927 and amended in 1933. The McFadden Act and its amendments restricted nationally chartered banks' branching abilities to the same extent allowed to state-chartered banks, which essentially prevented all U.S. banks from branching across state lines. Given the McFadden prohibition on interstate branching, bank organizations expanding across state lines between 1927 and 1956 relied on establishing subsidiaries rather than branches. Some of the largest banking organizations established multibank holding companies (MBHCs) for this purpose. An MBHC is a parent company that acquires more than one bank as a direct subsidiary (e.g., First Interstate).

In 1956, Congress recognized the potential loophole to interstate banking posed by the MBHC movement and passed the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act. This act permitted MBHCs to acquire bank subsidiaries only to the extent allowed by the laws of the state in which the proposed bank target resided. Because states prohibited out-of-state bank acquisitions, this temporarily curtailed the growth of the MBHC movement.

Maine took the first step in eroding interstate banking restrictions in 1978 by passing a law that exploited a loophole in the Douglas amendments of 1956. To increase employment in and growth of its financial services industry, Maine passed a law allowing banks from any other state to enter and acquire local banks even if the banks in Maine could not engage in such acquisitions in other states. This nationwide nonreciprocal bank acquisition law led to a rapid acquisition of Maine's banking assets by out-of-state bank holding companies. Indeed, by 1988, some 85 percent of bank assets in Maine were held by out-of-state banking organizations such as Citicorp (now Citigroup). In the early 1980s other states in New England sought to follow Maine's example by enacting their own interstate banking pacts. By 1994, all states but Hawaii had passed some form of interstate banking law or pact.

Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. It has long been recognized that the expansion of nationwide banking through multibank holding companies is potentially far more expensive than through branching. Separate corporations and boards of directors must be established for each bank in an MBHC, and it is hard to achieve the same level of economic and financial integration and synergies as is possible with branches. Moreover, most major banking competitor countries outside of the United States, such as Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, have nationwide branching.

In the fall of 1994, the U.S. Congress passed the Riegle-Neal Banking and Branching Efficiency Act that allowed U.S. and foreign banks to branch interstate by consolidating out-of-state bank subsidiaries into a branch network and/or by acquiring banks or individual branches of banks through acquisition or merger. The effective date for these new branching powers was June 1, 1997. Although the act was silent on the ability of banks to establish de novo branches in other states—essentially leaving it to individual states to pass laws allowing de novo branching—under the Riegle-Neal Act a New York bank such as Citibank may purchase, as an example, a single branch of Bank of America in San Francisco. The result of the Riegle-Neal Act is that full interstate banking is a reality in the United States. The relaxation of the branching restrictions, along with recognition of the potential cost, revenue, and risk benefits from geographic expansions, are major reasons for the recent merger wave (and increased consolidation) in U.S. banking (see Chapter 11).

# BANK AND SAVINGS INSTITUTION GUARANTEE FUNDS

A key component of the regulatory structure of CBs is deposit insurance and financial guarantees provided to depositors of CBs by regulators. Because the insurance fund that covers deposits of CBs also covers deposits of savings institutions (discussed in Chapter 14), this section discusses the deposit insurance funds as they pertain to both CBs and savings institutions.

# disintermediation

The withdrawal of deposits from depository institutions and their reinvestment elsewhere.

# regulator forbearance

A policy of not closing economically insolvent depository institutions, but allowing them to continue in operation.

# The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was created in 1933 in the wake of the banking panics of 1930-1933 to maintain the stability of, and public confidence in, the U.S. financial system. Over the period 1934-1979, the FDIC insurance system seemed to work well, failures were few (see Figure 13-3), and the FDIC insurance fund grew in size. During the October 1979 to October 1982 period, however, the Federal Reserve radically changed its monetary policy strategy by targeting bank reserves rather than interest rates in an attempt to lower the underlying rate of inflation (see Chapter 4). The Fed's restrictive monetary policy action led to a sudden and dramatic rise in interest rates, with rates on T-bills rising as high as 16 percent. This increase in short-term rates and the cost of funds had two effects. First, depository institutions faced negative interest spreads or net interest margins (i.e., interest income minus interest expense divided by earning assets) in funding much of their fixed-rate long-term residential mortgage portfolios over this period. Second, they had to pay more competitive interest rates on savings deposits to prevent disintermediation and the reinvestment of these funds in money market mutual fund accounts. Their ability to do this was constrained by the Federal Reserve's Regulation Q ceilings, which at the time limited the rates that depository institutions (DIs) could pay on traditional passbook savings account and retail time deposits.[10]

Partly to overcome the effects of rising interest rates and disintermediation on the DIs, Congress passed regulations that expanded depository institutions' deposit-taking and asset investment powers. For many DIs, the new powers created safer and more diversified institutions. For a small but significant group whose earnings and shareholders' capital were being eroded in traditional lines of business, however, it meant the opportunity to take more risks in an attempt to return to profitability. As discussed below, this risk-taking or moral hazard behavior was accentuated by the policies of depository institution insurers. They chose not to close capital-depleted, economically insolvent DIs (a policy of regulator forbearance) and to maintain deposit insurance premium assessments independent of the risk of the institution. As a result, beginning in 1980, the number of bank failures increased, with more than 1,170 from 1980 to 1990 (peaking at 205 in 1989). This number of failures was actually higher than that in the entire 1934-1979 period. Moreover, the costs of each of these failures were often larger than those of the mainly small bank failures that occurred in the 1934-1979 period. As the number and costs of these failures mounted in the 1980s, the FDIC fund was rapidly drained. In response to this crisis, Congress passed the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) in December 1991 to restructure the bank insurance fund and to prevent its potential insolvency.

After 1991 there was a dramatic turnaround in the fund's finances and a drop in DI failures—partially in response to record profit levels in DIs. Specifically, in 2007 there were 3 DI failures; in 2005 and 2006 there were no DI failures. As of March 2008, the FDIC's Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF) had reserves of  \$52.8 billion. However, the financial market crisis hit the banking industry very badly. In 2008, 26 DIs failed (at a cost to the FDIC of\$ 15.7 billion), in 2009 an additional 140 failures occurred (at a cost of over \$36.4 billion), in 2010, 157 failures occurred (at a cost of \$22.4 billion), and in 2011, 92 failures occurred (at a cost of \$7.2 billion). Thus, during the worst of the financial crisis (2008-2011), 414 DIs failed at a total cost to the FDIC of  \$81.7 billion. By September 2009, the FDIC's DIF reserves had fallen to$ -8.2 billion, less than zero for only the second time since its founding in 1933. The deficit peaked in the first quarter of 2010 at -\$20.86 billion. However, unlike the near bankruptcy of the FDIC in 1991, the negative balance in the FDIC's DI insurance fund did not result in talk of the insurer's possible failure. Rather, the FDIC and the federal government took several steps to ensure the fund would have sufficient resources to deal with any and all DI failures. To address the falling balance in the fund, the FDIC levied one special assessment in early 2009 and a second in the fall of 2009, in addition to raising the rates banks were charged for deposit insurance (see below). Further, the agency took the unprecedented step of requiring banks to prepay  \$45 billion of insurance premiums by the end of 2009. The premiums covered the fourth quarter of 2009 and all of 2010 through 2012. Finally, the FDIC was given approval to tap\$ 500 billion in additional funding from the Treasury Department through the end of 2010. The actions of regulators (and the end of the crisis) proved successful as only 92 banks failed in 2011 (costing \$6.89 billion) and 51 banks in 2012 (at a cost of \$2.78 billion). From 2013 to 2019, the number of bank failures continued to drop, reaching a low of zero failures in 2018 and only four in 2019. Further, FDIC reserves became positive ( \$3.9 billion) in the first quarter of 2011 and rose to\$ 110.3 billion by December 31, 2019.

# The Denise of the Federal Savings and Loan

# Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)

The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) insured the deposits of savings institutions from 1934 to 1989. Like the FDIC, this insurance fund was in relatively good shape until the end of the 1970s. Beginning in 1980, its resources began to be depleted as more and more savings institutions failed. Between 1980 and 1988, 581 savings institutions failed at an estimated cost of 42.3 billion. By 1989, the FSLIC fund had been depleted and the present value of its liabilities exceeded that of its assets. Lacking the resources to close or resolve failing savings institutions, the FSLIC followed a policy of forbearance (or leniency) toward remaining weak and failing savings institutions. This meant that it allowed many badly run savings institutions to stay open and continue to accumulate losses. In August 1989, Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), largely in response to the deepening crisis in the savings institution industry and the growing insolvency of the FSLIC. This act restructured the savings association fund and transferred its management to the FDIC. At that time, the FSLIC ceased to exist. At the same time, the restructured savings association insurance fund was renamed the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) and the restructured bank insurance fund was renamed the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF). (In March 2006, the FDIC merged the BIF and the SAIF to form the Depositors Insurance Fund [DIF]. Currently, the FDIC manages the DIF, which provides deposit insurance for both commercial banks and savings institutions.) See Figure 13-4 for the organizational structure of the FDIC and the number of commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the DIF.

# Reform of Deposit Insurance

On January 1, 1993, the FDIC introduced a risk-based deposit insurance program. Under this program, which applied equally to all deposit-insured institutions, a bank's or thrift's risk would be ranked along a capital adequacy dimension and a supervisory dimension (the depository institution's CAMELS rating, see Chapter 12). Each dimension had three categories, so a bank or thrift was placed in any one of nine cells. The best DIs, those in cell 1, which were well-capitalized and had healthy supervisory ratings, paid an annual insurance premium of 23 cents per  \$100 of deposits, while the worst DIs paid 31 cents. Although the 8-cent differential in insurance premiums between the safest and the riskiest CBs was a first step in risk-based pricing, it was considered to be so small that it did not effectively limit DIs' risk-taking incentives. The average assessment rate in 1993 was 23.2 cents per\$ 100 of deposits.

The improving solvency position of the FDIC (and of the banks and thrifts it insures) resulted in a considerable reduction in insurance premiums. In 1996 (for BIF-insured DIs) and 1997 (for SAIF-insured DIs) the fee structure for deposit insurance was changed so that the healthiest institutions paid 0 cents per  \$100 of deposits, while the riskiest paid 27 cents per\$ 100 of deposits. As a result, by December 2005, 94.6 percent of all BIF-insured DIs and 93.9 percent of all SAIF-insured DIs paid the statutory minimum premium, and the average assessment rate was less than 0.1 cent per 100 of deposits.

Despite the apparent strong health of the deposit insurance funds, in the early 2000s, the FDIC identified several weaknesses with the current system of deposit insurance that it felt needed to be corrected. Among these was that the current system did not effectively price risk. Specifically, regulations restricted the FDIC from charging premiums to well-capitalized and highly rated DIs as long as the insurance fund reserves were above 1.25 percent of insured deposits. As a result, and as stated earlier, over 90 percent of all insured DIs did not pay deposit insurance premiums in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The FDIC argued that it should charge regular premiums for risk regardless of the reserve levels of the fund. In February 2006, then President Bush signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 into law. Under the act, beginning in January 2007, the FDIC began calculating deposit insurance premiums based on a more aggressive, risk-based system. Further, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act, if the reserve ratio drops below 1.15 percent—or the FDIC expects it to do so within six months—the FDIC must, within 90 days, establish and implement a plan to restore the DIF to 1.15 percent within five years. Such was the case in March 2008 when the FDIC reserve ratio dropped to 1.19 percent. At this point the FDIC was certain that the reserve ratio would drop below 1.15 by the end of the next quarter. Accordingly, the FDIC developed and implemented

# Non-U.S. Deposit Insurance Systems

Most European countries have historically operated without explicit deposit insurance programs. Despite this, European countries have not seen the 1930s type of bank run and panic experienced in the United States. This is because European governments have often given implicit deposit guarantees at no cost to the largest banks in their countries. This has been possible as the result of the higher degree of concentration of deposits among the largest banks in European countries. However, deposit insurance systems are being increasingly adopted worldwide. One view of this trend toward implementation of explicit deposit programs is that governments are now simply collecting premiums as a fee to offset an obligation (implicit deposit insurance) that they previously offered for free.

Many of these systems offer quite different degrees of protection to depositors compared to the U.S. system. For example, in response to the single banking and capital market in Europe, the European Union (EU) has established a single deposit insurance system covering all EU-located banks. This insures deposit accounts up to 50,000 euros. However, depositors are subject to a 10 percent deductible (loss) to create incentives for them to monitor banks. The idea underlying the EU plan is to create a level playing field for banks across all European Union countries. Appendix 13D (available through Connect or your course instructor) shows a list of countries that offer (and do not offer) explicit deposit insurance schemes.

# BALANCE SHEET REGULATIONS

A further form of regulation of CBs pertains to various assets and liabilities on their balance sheets.

# LG 13-6

# Regulations on Commercial Bank Liquidity

Holding relatively small amounts of liquid assets exposes a CB to increased illiquidity and insolvency risk. Excessive illiquidity can result in a CB's inability to meet required payments on liability claims (such as deposit withdrawals) and, at the extreme, its insolvency. Moreover, it can even lead to contagious effects that negatively impact other CBs. Consequently, regulators impose minimum liquid asset reserve requirements on CBs. In general, these requirements differ in nature and scope for various CBs. The requirements depend on the illiquidity risk exposure perceived for the CB's type and other regulatory objectives that relate to minimum liquid asset requirements (see Chapter 4). Currently, in accordance with Federal Reserve Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, banks in the United States are required to hold the following "target" minimum reserves against net transaction accounts (transaction accounts minus demand deposit balances due from U.S. commercial banks and cash items in process of collection):

Less than 15.2 million 0\%

\$15.2 million-\$ 110.2 million 3

More than 110.2 million 10

In Appendix 13B we discuss the details of how to calculate the minimum reserve requirement for a bank.

11. The Garn-St. Germain Commercial Banks Act of 1982 requires that 2 million of reservable liabilities of each commercial bank be subject to a zero percent reserve requirement. Each year, the Federal Reserve adjusts the amount of reservable liabilities subject to this zero percent reserve requirement for the succeeding calendar year by 80 percent of the percentage increase in the total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions, measured on an annual basis as of June 30.

During the financial crisis, many DIs struggled to maintain adequate liquidity. Indeed, extraordinary levels of liquidity assistance were required from central banks in order to maintain the financial system. Even with this extensive support, a number of DIs failed or were forced into mergers. Recognizing the need for DIs to improve their liquidity risk management and control their liquidity risk exposure, the Bank for International Settlement's (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision developed two new regulatory standards for liquidity risk supervision. The standards are intended to "enhance tools, metrics, and benchmarks that supervisors can use to assess the resilience of banks' liquidity cushions and constrain any weakening in liquidity maturity profiles, diversity of funding sources, and stress testing practices." The two new liquidity ratios to be maintained by DIs are the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio. We discuss these ratios in detail in Chapter 22.

# Regulations on Capital Adequacy (Leverage)

# Basel Agreement

The requirement to impose risk-based capital ratios on banks in major industrialized countries.

The FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 required that banks and thrifts adopt risk-based capital requirements. Consistent with this act, U.S. DI regulators formally agreed with other member countries of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to implement new risk-based capital ratios for all depository institutions under their jurisdiction. The BIS phased in and fully implemented these risk-based capital ratios on January 1, 1993, under what has become known as the Basel Agreement (or Basle; now called Basel I). The 1993 Basel Agreement explicitly incorporated the different credit risks of assets (both on and off the balance sheet) into capital adequacy measures. This was followed with a revision in 1998 in which market risk was incorporated into risk-based capital in the form of an add-on to the 8 percent ratio for credit risk exposure. In 2001, the BIS issued a consultative document, "The New Basel Capital Accord," that proposed the incorporation of operational risk into capital requirements and updated the credit risk assessments in the 1993 agreement.

The new Basel Accord or Agreement (called Basel II) of 2006 allowed for a range of options for addressing both credit and operational risk. Two options related to the measurement of credit risk. The first was the Standardized Approach and the second was an Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach. The Standardized Approach was similar to that of the 1993 agreement, but was more risk sensitive. Under the IRB Approach, DIs were allowed to use their internal estimates of borrower creditworthiness to assess credit risk in their portfolios (using their own internal rating systems and credit scoring models) subject to strict methodological and disclosure standards, as well as explicit approval by the DI's supervising regulator.

The financial crisis of 2008-2009 revealed weaknesses with Basel II. For example, ratings of credit risk on various securities, such as credit default swaps, were conducted by private companies without the supervision or review by official regulatory agencies. Further, the Basel II capital adequacy formula for credit risk was procyclical. Thus, as the financial crisis developed, the probability of borrower default and loss on default both increased, which meant that regulatory capital requirements increased. However, during the crisis, banks were unable to raise the required capital and thus had to turn to central banks for capital injections and liquidity support.

In response to these issues, Basel 2.5 was passed in 2009 (effective in 2013) and Basel III was passed in 2010 (fully effective in 2019). Basel 2.5 updated capital requirements on market risk from banks' trading operations. The goal of Basel III is to raise the quality, consistency, and transparency of the capital base of banks to withstand credit risk and to strengthen the risk coverage of the capital framework. Under Basel III, advanced (IRB) approaches may be used by institutions that have consolidated assets of  \$250 billion or more or consolidated on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of\$ 10 billion or

more (approximately 20 of the largest U.S. banking organizations). All other depository institutions must use the Standardized Approach for calculating capital adequacy.

Under Basel III, depository institutions must calculate and monitor four capital ratios: common equity Tier I (CET1) risk-based capital ratio, Tier I risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier I leverage ratio. A DI's capital adequacy is assessed according to where its capital ratios place in one of five target zones.

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {C o m m o n e q u i t y T i e r I} & = \quad \text {C o m m o n e q u i t y T i e r I c a p i t a l / R i s k -} \\ \text {r i s k - b a s e d c a p i t a l r a t i o} & \text {w e i g h t e d a s s e t s} \end{array}
$$

$$
\text {T i e r I r i s k - b a s e d c a p i t a l r a t i o} = \begin{array}{l} \text {T i e r I c a p i t a l (C o m m o n e q u i t y T i e r I} \\ \text {c a p i t a l + A d d i t i o n a l T i e r I c a p i t a l) /} \\ \text {R i s k - w e i g h t e d a s s e t s} \end{array}
$$

$$
\text {T o t a l} = \text {T o t a l} \quad \text {(T i e r I + T i e r I I) / R i s k -}
$$

$$
\text {T i e r I l e v e r g a r e r a t i o} = \text {T i e r I c a p i t a l / T o t a l e x p o s u r e}
$$

The calculation of these capital adequacy measures is quite complex. Their major innovation is to distinguish among the different credit risks of assets on the balance sheet and to identify the credit risk inherent in instruments off the balance sheet by using a risk-weighted assets denominator in these capital adequacy ratios. In a very rough fashion, these capital ratios mark to market a DI's onand off-balance-sheet positions to reflect its credit risk. Further, additional capital charges must be held against market risk and operational risk. To be adequately capitalized, a DI must meet the following requirements: (1) hold a minimum ratio of common equity Tier I capital to credit risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent, (2) maintain a ratio of Tier I capital to credit risk-weighted assets of 6 percent, (3) hold a ratio of total capital to credit risk-weighted assets of 8 percent, and (4) maintain a ratio of Tier I leverage ratio of 4 percent.

In addition to their use in defining adequately capitalized DIs, these capital ratios also define well capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized as part of the prompt corrective action program under the FDICIA. These five zones—specified in Table 13-3—assess capital adequacy and the actions regulators are mandated to take and those they have the discretion to take. Since December 18, 1992, under the FDICIA legislation, regulators must take specific actions—prompt corrective action (PCA)—when a DI falls outside the zone 1, or well-capitalized, category.

Source: Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Press Release, September 2016, www.federalreserve.gov summarizes these regulatory actions. Most important, a receiver must be appointed when a DI's tangible equity (Tier I + Non-Tier I perpetual preferred stock) to total assets ratio falls to 2 percent or less. That is, receivership is mandatory even before the book value ratio falls to 0 percent. Between 1994 and June 2008, less than 0.5 percent of depository institution industry assets were classified as critically undercapitalized. This compares with 31.3 percent critically undercapitalized in the fourth quarter of 1990 (i.e., during the 1989-1991 recession) and 2.25 percent in June 2009 (during the much deeper recession in the late 2000s).

The idea behind the mandatory and discretionary sets of actions to be taken by regulators for each of the capital adequacy zones is to enforce minimum capital requirements and limit the ability of regulators to show forbearance to the worst capitalized DIs. For example, regulators acted quickly to ensure the largest DIs had sufficient capital to withstand large losses during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In late February 2009, the Obama administration announced that it would conduct a "stress test" of the 19 largest U.S. FIs that would measure the ability of those FIs to withstand a protracted economic slump—an unemployment rate above 10 percent and home prices dropping another 25 percent. (This stress test focused more on leverage and tangible capital than on risk-based capital, discussed below.) Results of the stress test (reported in Table 13-5) showed that 10 of the 19 FIs needed to raise a total of  \$74.6 billion in capital. Within a month of the May 7, 2009, release of the results, the FIs had raised\$ 149.45 billion of capital.

In addition to this initial stress test, as part of the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the largest banks are subject to annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The annual review is designed to ensure that the banks are properly capitalized. Scenarios used

as part of the stress test range from baseline to severely adverse, with the most extreme including deep and prolonged global recession in which U.S. real GDP falls  $6 \frac{1}{4}$  percent below the pre-recession peak, the unemployment rate increases to 10 percent, consumer price inflation rises to  $1 \frac{1}{4}$  percent, equity prices fall 50 percent, equity market volatility increases to levels experienced in 2008, housing prices drop 25 percent, and the euro area, United Kingdom, and Japan experience severe recessions. The 2016 stress tests found 30 of the 33 of the biggest U.S. banks tested had enough capital to continue lending during a severe economic shock and received a nonobjection to their submitted capital plans. However, Morgan Stanley received a conditional nonobjection to its submitted capital plan, meaning that the bank was required to resubmit its capital plan within six months to address deficiencies observed in the submitted plan. However, the firm was allowed to continue with its planned distributions until the Federal Reserve made a determination on the resubmitted capital plan. The final two banks, Deutsche Bank and Santander Holdings USA, received an objection to their capital plan, meaning these banks could only make capital distributions that are expressly permitted by the Federal Reserve.

Capital. In the measurement of a DI's capital adequacy, its capital is the standard by which each of these risks is measured. Under Basel III, a DI's capital is divided into common equity Tier I (CET1), additional Tier I, and Tier II. CET1 is primary or core capital of the DI; Tier I capital is the primary capital of the DI plus additional capital elements; and Tier II capital is supplementary capital. The total capital that the DI holds is defined as the sum of Tier I and Tier II capital. The definitions of CET1, additional Tier I capital, and Tier II supplementary capital are listed in Appendix 13E to this chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor).

# risk-weighted assets

Onand off-balance-sheet assets whose values are adjusted for approximate credit risk.

Risk-Weighted Assets. Under Basel III capital adequacy rules, risk-weighted assets represent the denominator of the risk-based capital ratios. Two components make up risk-weighted assets: (1) risk-weighted on-balance-sheet assets, and (2) risk-weighted off-balance-sheet assets. In Appendix 13E to the chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor), we discuss the details of how to calculate a CB's risk-based capital ratios.

Capital Conservation Buffer. In addition to revising the minimum capital ratio requirements for credit risk, Basel III introduced a capital conservation buffer designed to ensure that DIs build up a capital surplus, or buffer, outside periods of financial stress that can be drawn down as losses are incurred during periods of financial stress. The buffer requirements provide incentives for DIs to build up a capital surplus (e.g., by reducing discretionary distributions of earnings [reduced dividends, share buybacks, and staff bonuses]) to reduce the risk that their capital levels could fall below the minimum requirements during periods of stress. The capital conservation buffer must be composed of CET1 capital and is held separately from the minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Under Basel III, a DI would need to hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. If a DI's capital buffer falls below 2.5 percent, constraints on earnings payouts (e.g., dividends, share buybacks, and "bonus" payments) will be imposed.

Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Basel III also introduced a countercyclical capital buffer that may be declared by any country experiencing excess aggregate credit growth. The countercyclical capital buffer can vary between 0 percent and 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. This buffer must be met with CET1 capital, and DIs are given 12 months to adjust to the buffer level. Like the capital conservation buffer, if a DI's capital levels fall below the set countercyclical capital buffer, restrictions on earnings payouts will be applied.

The countercyclical capital buffer aims to protect the banking system and reduce systemic exposures to economic downturns. Losses can be particularly large when a downturn is preceded by a period of excess credit growth. The accumulation of a capital buffer during an expansionary phase increases the ability of the banking system to remain healthy during periods of declining asset prices and losses from weakening credit conditions. By assessing a countercyclical buffer when credit markets are overheated, accumulated capital buffers can absorb any abnormal losses that a DI might experience when the credit cycle turns. Consequently, even after these losses are realized, DIs should remain healthy and able to access funding, meet obligations, and continue to serve as credit intermediaries.

19. What actions regulators must take under prompt corrective action (PCA)?

Global Systemically Important Banks. As part of Basel III, the BIS imposed an additional common equity Tier I surcharge ("loss absorbency requirement") on global systemically important banks (G-SIBs): banking groups whose distress or disorderly failure would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity. The basic idea is that because G-SIBs are too-big-to-fail banks (that would have to be bailed out by central governments and taxpayers), they need to lower their risk by increasing their tangible capital requirements even more than other banks. The surcharge ranges from 1 percent to 3.5 percent to be held over and above the 7 percent minimum CET1 plus conservation buffer requirement. Thus, to have no payment limitations, a G-SIB that is assigned a surcharge of 1.5 percent much have a CET1 ratio of 8.5 percent ( $= 4.5$  percent required to be adequately capitalized + 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer + 1.5 percent surcharge). The surcharge may be larger under exceptional circumstances. For example, in 2015 JPMorgan Chase was required to hold a surcharge of 4.5 percent because of its extreme size, complexity, and entanglements with other big financial institutions. The purpose of the additional capital requirement is twofold: (1) to reduce the probability of failure of a G-SIB by increasing its going-concern loss absorbency and (2) to reduce the extent or impact of the failure of a G-SIB on the financial system by improving global recovery and resolution frameworks.

G-SIBs are identified using a methodology developed by the BIS based on an indicator measurement approach that identifies factors that cause international contagion. The indicators were selected to capture the systemic impact of a bank's failure, rather than the probability that the bank will fail. Using this methodology, The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and national authorities, has identified the 2019 list of G-SIBs, based on end of 2018 data.

Table 13-6 provides a list of the 30 G-SIBs and the capital surcharge for each as of 2019. The number of G-SIBs can change over time, reflecting changes in the systemic importance of banks. The sample of banks to be assessed will be reviewed every three years, and the BIS also anticipates eventually expanding the surcharge to a wider group of financial institutions, including insurance companies and other nonbank financial institutions.[13]

# FOREIGN VERSUS DOMESTIC REGULATION OF COMMERCIAL BANKS

As discussed earlier in this chapter, many of the product and geographic expansion barriers on U.S. commercial banks have recently been lowered. Despite the loosening of regulations, however, U.S. CBs are still subject to stricter regulations than CBs in many foreign countries.

# Product Diversification Activities

With the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, the range of non-bank product activities that U.S. banks are permitted to engage in is now more comparable to bank activities allowed in the major industrialized countries.

# LG 13-5

# Global or International Expansion Activities

U.S. CBs have expanded into foreign countries through branches and subsidiaries; this has been reciprocated by the increased entrance of foreign CBs into U.S. financial service markets.

# Eurodollar transaction

Any transaction involving dollars that takes place outside the United States.

Regulations of U.S. Banks in Foreign Countries. Although some U.S. banking organizations such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have had foreign offices since the beginning of the 20th century, the major phase of expansion began in the early 1960s following passage of the Overseas Direct Investment Control Act of 1964. This law restricted U.S. banks' ability to lend to U.S. corporations that wanted to make foreign investments. This law was eventually repealed, but it created incentives for U.S. banks to establish foreign offices to service the funding and other business needs of their U.S. clients in other countries. This offshore funding and lending in dollars created the beginning of a market we now call the Eurodollar market. The term Eurodollar transaction denotes any transaction involving dollars that takes place outside the United States. For example, a banking transaction booked externally to the boundaries of the United States, often through an overseas branch or subsidiary, qualifies as a Eurodollar.[14]

As a result of these changes, U.S. banks have been accelerating their foreign business in recent years. U.S. bank claims held outside the country have risen from  \$320.1 billion in 1990 to\$ 3,252.0 billion in 2010 before declining to  \$2,672.6 billion in 2013 (see Table 13-7). By 2018, claims held outside the United States had risen back to\$ 2,825.6 billion, still below 2010 levels. Interestingly, a major segment has been "offshore banking"—issuing loans and accepting deposits. The U.S. bank claims held in the United Kingdom (reported in Table 13-7) reflect its importance as the center of the Eurodollar market, which is the market for dollar loans and deposits made and held outside the United States.

Political risk concerns among savers in emerging market countries have led to enormous outflows of dollars from those countries, often to U.S. branches and subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas, which have very stringent bank secrecy rules. Because of the secrecy rules in some foreign countries and the possibility that these rules may result in money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, the U.S. government enacted the USA Patriot Act of 2001, which amended the Bank Secrecy Act in establishing standards for screening customers who open accounts at financial institutions. Title III of the act prohibits U.S. banks from providing banking services to foreign banks that have no physical presence in any country (so-called shell banks). The bill also added foreign corruption offenses to the list of crimes that can trigger a U.S. money-laundering prosecution. Also, federal authorities have the power to subpoena the records of a foreign bank's U.S. correspondent account. Further, the bill makes a depositor's funds in a foreign bank's U.S. correspondent account subject to the same civil forfeiture rules that apply to depositors' funds in other U.S. accounts. Finally, the act requires U.S. banks to improve their due diligence review in order to guard against money laundering.

# national treatment

Regulation of foreign banks in the same fashion as domestic banks, or the creation of a level playing field.

Regulation of Foreign Banks in the United States. Prior to 1978, foreign branches and agencies entering the United States were primarily licensed at the state level. As such, their entry, regulation, and oversight were almost totally confined to the state level. Beginning in 1978 with the passage of the International Banking Act (IBA) and the 1991 passage of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act (FBSEA), federal regulators have exerted increasing control over foreign banks operating in the United States.

The International Banking Act of 1978. Before the passage in 1978 of the IBA, foreign agencies and branches entering the United States with state licenses had some competitive advantages and disadvantages relative to most domestic banks. The unequal treatment of domestic and foreign banks regarding federal regulation and the lobbying by domestic banks regarding the unfairness of this situation provided the impetus for Congress to pass the IBA in 1978. The fundamental regulatory philosophy underlying the IBA was one of national treatment, a philosophy that attempted to create a level playing field for domestic and foreign banks in U.S. banking markets. As a result of this act, foreign banks were required to hold Federal Reserve-specified reserve requirements if their worldwide assets exceeded 1 billion, and they became subject to Federal Reserve examinations as well as both the McFadden and Glass-Steagall Acts.

The Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act (FBSEA) of 1991. Along with the growth of foreign bank assets in the United States came concerns about foreign banks' rapidly increasing share of U.S. banking markets and about the weakness of regulatory oversight of many of these institutions. Three events focused attention on the weaknesses of foreign bank regulation. The first event was the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which had a highly complex international organization structure based in the Middle East, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg and had undisclosed ownership stakes in two large U.S. banks. BCCI was not subject to any consolidated supervision by a home country regulator. This quickly became apparent after its collapse, when massive fraud, insider lending abuses, and money-laundering operations were discovered. The second event was the issuance of more than 1 billion in unauthorized letters of credit to Saddam Hussein's Iraq by the Atlanta agency of an Italian bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The third event was the unauthorized taking of deposit funds by the U.S. representative office of the Greek National Mortgage Bank of New York.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

20. What regulatory changes have encouraged the growth of U.S. offshore banking? What factors have deterred U.S. offshore banking?
21. The impact of the passage of the International Banking Act of 1978 on foreign bank activities in the United States?
22. What the five main features of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enforcement Act of 1991 are?

These events and related concerns led to the passage of the FBSEA in 1991. The objective of this act was to extend federal regulatory authority over foreign banking organizations in the United States, especially when these organizations had entered using state licenses. The act's five main features have significantly enhanced the powers of federal bank regulators over foreign banks in the United States:

1. Entry—under FBSEA, a foreign banking organization must now have the Fed's approval to establish a subsidiary, branch, agency, or representative office in the United States. The approval applies to both a new entry and an entry by acquisition. To secure Fed approval, the organization must meet a number of standards, two of which are mandatory. First, the foreign bank must be subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by a home country regulator. Second, that regulator must furnish all the information that the Federal Reserve requires to evaluate the application. Both standards attempt to avoid the lack of disclosure and lack of centralized supervision associated with BCCI's failure.
2. Closure—FBSEA also gives the Federal Reserve authority to close a foreign bank if its home country supervision is inadequate, if it violates U.S. laws, or if it engages in unsound and unsafe banking practices.
3. Examination—the Federal Reserve has the power to examine each office of a foreign bank, including its representative offices. Further, each branch or agency must be examined at least once a year.
4. Deposit taking—only foreign subsidiaries with access to FDIC insurance can take retail deposits under 250,000. This effectively rolls back the provision of the IBA that gave foreign branches and agencies access to FDIC insurance.
5. Activity powers—beginning December 19, 1992, state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks were not allowed to engage in any activity that was not permitted to a federal branch.

Overall, the FBSEA considerably increased the Federal Reserve's authority over foreign banks and added to the regulatory burden or costs of entry into the United States for foreign banks. This has made the post-FBSEA U.S. banking market much less attractive to foreign banks than it was over the period 1980-1992.

# SUMMARY

Commercial banks provide services that are vital to all sectors of the economy. Failure to efficiently provide these services can be costly to both the suppliers and users of funds. Consequently, CBs are regulated to protect against a breakdown in the provision of CB services. In this chapter, we reviewed the regulations imposed on CBs. We provided an overview of historic and current regulations on CBs' product offerings and geographic expansion opportunities. The recent loosening of regulations in these areas has resulted in the emergence of many large U.S. CBs as globally oriented universal banks. We also described regulations on the asset and liability portfolios of CBs. The chapter concluded with a look at foreign CB regulations and the regulation of foreign CBs in the United States.

# APPENDIX 13A: Calculation of Deposit Insurance Premiums

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) required that the FDIC establish a risk-based assessment system. To implement this requirement, the FDIC introduced a system in 1993 that placed institutions into risk categories based on two criteria: capital levels and supervisory ratings. Three capital groups—well capitalized, adequately capitalized, and undercapitalized, which are numbered 1, 2, and 3, respectively—were based on leverage ratios and risk-based capital ratios for regulatory capital purposes. Three supervisory subgroups, termed A, B, and C, were based upon the FDIC's consideration of evaluations provided by the institution's primary federal regulator and other information the FDIC deemed relevant. Subgroup A consisted of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses; subgroup B consisted of institutions that demonstrated weaknesses that, if not corrected, could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the insurance fund; and subgroup C consisted of institutions that posed a substantial probability of loss to the insurance fund unless effective corrective action is taken.

In practice, the subgroup evaluations were generally based on an institution's composite CAMELS rating, a rating assigned by the institution's supervisor at the end of a bank examination, with 1 being the best rating and 5 being the lowest. Generally speaking, institutions with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 were put in supervisory subgroup A, those with a CAMELS rating of 3 were put in subgroup B, and those with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5 were put in subgroup C. Thus, in this assessment system, the highest-rated (least risky) institutions were assigned to category 1A and the lowest-rated (riskiest) institutions to category 3C. The three capital groups and three supervisory subgroups form a nine-cell matrix for risk-based assessments (Table 13-8).

From January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1995, the assessment rates (in basis points or cents per 100 of deposit insurance assessment base) for the nine risk categories were as shown in Table 13-9.

From January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2006, the assessment rates (in basis points or cents per 100 of deposit insurance assessment base) for the nine risk categories were as shown in Table 13-10.

In 2007, the FDIC amended its regulations to create a new risk differentiation system, consolidating the nine risk categories into four and named them Risk Categories I, II, III, and IV. The consolidation creates four new risk categories as shown in Table 13-11.

Risk Category I contains all well-capitalized institutions in Supervisory Group A (generally those with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2)—that is, those institutions that would be placed in the former 1A category. Risk Category II contains all institutions in Supervisory Groups A and B (generally those with CAMELS composite ratings of 1, 2, or 3), except those in Risk Category I and undercapitalized institutions. Risk Category III contains all undercapitalized institutions in Supervisory Groups A and B and institutions in Supervisory Group C (generally those with CAMELS composite ratings of 4 or 5) that are not undercapitalized. Risk Category IV contains all undercapitalized institutions in Supervisory Group C—that is, those institutions that would be placed in the former 3C category.

The 2007 rule established the base rate schedule in Table 13-12 and allowed the FDIC to adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next up to three basis points above or below the base schedule without further notice-and-comment rulemaking.

The rule combines supervisory ratings and financial ratios to determine assessment rates. In particular, each of the risk measures (i.e., each institution's financial ratios and weighted average CAMELS component rating) will be multiplied by the corresponding pricing multipliers (see Table 13-13). The sum of these products will be added to (or subtracted from) a uniform amount, 1.954. The uniform amount is derived from a statistical analysis. However, no rate within Risk Category I will be less than the minimum assessment rate applicable to the category or higher than the maximum assessment rate applicable to the category.

Table 13-14 gives initial base assessment rates for three institutions with varying characteristics, assuming the pricing multipliers given earlier, using the base assessment rates for institutions in Risk Category I (which range between a minimum of 2 basis points

The assessment rate for an institution in the table is calculated by multiplying the pricing multipliers by the risk measure values to produce each measure's contribution to the assessment rate. The sum of the products plus the uniform amount yields the total assessment rate. For Institution 1 in Table 13-14, this sum actually equals 1.56, but the table reflects the assumed minimum assessment rate of 2 basis points. For Institution 3 in the table, the sum actually equals 4.25, but the table reflects the assumed maximum assessment rate of 4 basis points. Weights for the CAMELS components to calculate the weighted average CAMELS rating are 25 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, 10 percent, 10 percent, and 10 percent for the C, A, M, E, L, and S components, respectively.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the Reform Act), the FDIC was required to set and publish annually the designated reserve ratio (DRR) for the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) within a range of 1.15 percent to 1.50 percent. Beginning in January 2007, the FDIC established the DRR for the DIF at 1.25 percent. However, failures of FDIC-insured institutions caused the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to decline from 1.19 percent as of March 30, 2008, to 1.01 percent as of June 30, 0.76 percent as of September 30, and 0.40 percent as of December 31, 2008. Because the fund reserve ratio fell below 1.15 percent as of June 30, 2008, and was expected to remain below 1.15 percent, the Reform Act required the FDIC to establish and implement a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.15 percent within five years. In the FDIC's view, restoring the reserve ratio to at least 1.15 percent within five years required an increase in assessment rates. Because rates were already three basis points above the base rate schedule, a new rulemaking was required. Consequently, the FDIC Board of Directors proposed that, effective January 1, 2009, assessment rates would increase uniformly by seven basis points for the first quarter 2009 assessment period (see Table 13-15).

Effective April 1, 2009, the FDIC introduced a new way in which the FDIC's risk-based assessment system differentiates for risk and set new deposit insurance assessment rates.[16] The rule also updated the uniform amount and the pricing multipliers for the weighted average CAMELS component ratings and financial ratios. The FDIC believed

that the rulemaking will make the assessment system more sensitive to risk. The rulemaking should also make the risk-based assessment system fairer, by limiting the subsidization of riskier institutions by safer ones. Under the 2009 rule, an institution's total base assessment rate can vary from the initial base rate as the result of possible adjustments: unsecured debt adjustment, secured liability adjustment, and brokered deposit adjustment.

An institution's unsecured debt adjustment—the institution's ratio of long-term unsecured debt (and, for small institutions, certain amounts of its Tier 1 capital) to domestic deposits—will lower the institution's base assessment rate. Any decrease in base assessment rates will be limited to five basis points. An institution's secured liability adjustment—which is based on the institution's ratio of secured liabilities to domestic deposits—will raise its base assessment rate. An institution's ratio of secured liabilities to domestic deposits (if greater than 25 percent), will increase its assessment rate, but the resulting base assessment rate after any such increase can be no more than 50 percent greater than it was before the adjustment. Institutions in all risk categories will be subject to the unsecured debt adjustment and secured liability adjustment. In addition, the final rule makes a final adjustment for brokered deposits (the brokered deposit adjustment) for institutions in Risk Category II, III, or IV. An institution's ratio of brokered deposits to domestic deposits (if greater than 10 percent) will increase its assessment rate, but any increase will be limited to no more than 10 basis points. After applying all possible adjustments, minimum and maximum total base assessment rates for each risk category are as shown in Table 13-16 for established institutions (insured five or more years).

Newly insured institutions with a CAMELS composite rating will be assessed at the same rate as established institutions, but newly insured institutions without a CAMELS composite rating in Risk Category I have slightly lower assessment rates. In addition, the 2009 rule introduced a new financial ratio into the financial ratios method. This new financial measure—the adjusted brokered deposit ratio—will measure the extent to which brokered deposits are funding rapid asset growth. The adjusted brokered deposit ratio will affect only those established Risk Category I institutions whose total gross assets are more than 40 percent greater than they were four years previously, after adjusting for mergers and acquisitions. Generally speaking, the greater an institution's asset growth and the greater its percentage of brokered deposits, the greater will be the increase in its initial base assessment rate.

The FDIC is adding this new risk measure for a couple of reasons. A number of costly institution failures, including some recent failures, involved rapid asset growth funded through brokered deposits. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant correlation between rapid asset growth funded by brokered deposits and the probability of an institution's being downgraded from a CAMELS composite 1 or 2 rating to a CAMELS composite 3, 4, or 5 rating within a year. A significant correlation is the standard the FDIC used when it adopted the financial ratios method in the 2006 assessments rule.

The 2009 rule contains a recalculated uniform amount and recalculated pricing multipliers for the weighted average CAMELS component rating and financial ratios. The uniform amount and pricing multipliers under the final rule adopted in 2006 were derived

*In basis points from a statistical estimate of the probability that an institution will be downgraded to CAMELS 3, 4, or 5 at its next examination using data from the end of the years 1984 to 2004. These probabilities were then converted to pricing multipliers for each risk measure. The new pricing multipliers were derived using essentially the same statistical techniques but were based upon data from the end of the years 1988 to 2006. The new pricing multipliers are set out in Table 13-17.

Table 13-18 gives initial base assessment rates for three institutions with varying characteristics, given the new pricing multipliers above, using initial base assessment rates for institutions in Risk Category I of 12 basis points to 16 basis points. The initial base assessment rate for an institution in Table 13-18 is calculated by multiplying the pricing multipliers by the risk measure values to produce each measure's contribution to the assessment rate. The sum of the products plus the uniform amount yields the initial base assessment rate. For Institution 1 in the table, this sum actually equals 11.35 basis points, but the table reflects the initial base minimum assessment rate of 12 basis points. For Institution 3 in the table, the sum actually equals 17.48 basis points, but the table reflects the initial base maximum assessment rate of 16 basis points.

January 2010 base assessment rates for established institutions (those insured five or more years) remained the same, but base assessment rates for newly insured institutions (those insured less than five years) increased slightly. Regarding the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) provides the following:

- Established a minimum designated reserve ratio (DRR) of 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the new assessment base: average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.
- If the reserve ratio falls below 1.35 percent, or the FDIC projects that the reserve ratio will, within 6 months, fall below 1.35 percent, the FDIC generally must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the DIF will return to 1.35 percent within eight years.

- Notwithstanding that eight-year requirement, however, the FDIC must take steps as necessary for the reserve ratio to reach 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020.
- The FDIC must offset the effect on small institutions (less than 10 billion in assets) of the requirement that the reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, rather than 1.15 percent by the end of 2016.
- If the reserve ratio exceeds 1.5 percent, the FDIC must dividend to DIF members the amount above the amount necessary to maintain the DIF at 1.5 percent, but the FDIC Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, suspend or limit the declaration of payment of dividends.
- For at least five years, the FDIC must make available to the public the reserve ratio and the Designated Reserve Ratio using both estimated insured deposits and the new assessment base.

The base assessment rates based on 2011 rule was in effect from April 1, 2011, through June 30, 2016.[17] The rate schedule in Table 13-19 includes a column for institutions with at least  \$10 billion in total assets. This column represents the assessment rates that will be applied to institutions of this size pursuant to the changes to the large institution pricing system discussed below. The range of total base assessment rates (2.5 basis points to 45 basis points) is the same for institutions of all sizes; however, institutions with at least\$ 10 billion in total assets will not be assigned to risk categories.

Current assessment rates have been in effect starting July 1, 2016.  ${}^{18}$  Base assessment rates for established institutions (those insured five or more years) are in Table 13-20. The 2016 rule eliminates risk categories and adopts the range of initial assessment rates for established small banks set out in Table 13-20.

As for newly insured small institutions (those insured less than five years), base assessment rates are based on the four risk categories as shown in Table 13-21.

The financial ratios method in the 2016 rule uses the measures described in the right-hand column of Table 13-22. For comparison's sake, the measures used in the 2011 financial ratios method are set out on the left-hand column of the table. Three of the measures in the 2016 rule—the weighted average CAMELS component rating, the leverage ratio, and the net income ratio measure—are identical or very similar to the measures used in the 2011 financial ratios method. The 2011 nonperforming assets/gross assets measure included other real estate owned. In the 2016 rule, other real estate owned/gross assets is a separate measure from nonperforming loans and leases/gross assets. The remaining three financial measures—the brokered deposit ratio, the one-year asset growth measure, and the loan mix index—are described in detail below. The brokered deposit ratio and the one-year asset growth measure replace the 2011 adjusted brokered deposit ratio.

# Brokered Deposit Ratio

The 2016 rule replaces the adjusted brokered deposit ratio used in the 2011 financial ratios method with a brokered deposit ratio, defined as the ratio of brokered deposits to total assets, and with a one-year asset growth measure, which is discussed later. The 2016 rule also eliminates the existing brokered deposit adjustment applicable to established small banks outside Risk Category I. Under the new brokered deposit ratio applicable to all established small banks, brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of total assets may increase assessment rates. For a bank that is well capitalized and has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits will be deducted from brokered deposits. For a bank that is less than well capitalized or has a CAMELS composite rating of 3, 4, or 5, however, reciprocal deposits will be included with other brokered deposits.

# One-Year Asset Growth Measure

The 2016 rule uses a one-year asset growth measure that increases an established small bank's assessment rate only if it has had one-year asset growth greater than 10 percent. The one-year asset growth measure will raise assessment rates for established small banks that grow rapidly (other than through merger or by acquiring failed banks) but will not increase assessments for normal asset growth. The reason for having two separate measures is that brokered deposits pose risks other than enabling banks to engage in rapid asset growth. Brokered deposits increase a bank's probability of failure (even after controlling for asset growth) and increase the loss to the DIF in the event of failure. In addition, rapid asset growth can be funded by liabilities other than brokered deposits.

# Loan Mix Index

The loan mix index is a measure of the extent to which a bank's total assets include higher-risk categories of loans. The index uses historical industrywide charge-off rates to identify loan types with higher risk. Each category of loan in a bank's loan portfolio is divided by

TABLE 13-22

<table><tr><td>Risk Measures in 2011 Rule</td><td>Risk Measures in 2016 Rule</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratioLoans past due 30–89 days/gross assetsNonperforming assets/gross assetsNet loan charge-offs/gross assetsNet income before taxes/risk-weighted assetsAdjusted brokered deposit ratioWeighted average CAMELS rating</td><td>Leverage ratioNonperforming loans and leases/gross assetsOther real estate owned/gross assetsNet income before taxes/total assetsBrokered deposit ratioOne-year asset growthWeighted average CAMELS ratingLoan mix index</td></tr></table> the bank's total assets to determine the percentage of the bank's assets represented by that category of loan. Each percentage is then multiplied by that category of loan's historical weighted average industrywide charge-off rate. The products are then summed to determine the loan mix index value for that bank.

The loan categories in the loan mix index were selected based on the availability of category-specific charge-off rates over a sufficiently lengthy period (2001-2014) to be representative. The loan categories exclude credit card loans. For each loan category's weighted-average industrywide charge-off rate, the weight for each year's charge-off rate is proportional to the number of bank failures in that year. Thus, charge-off rates from 2008-2014, during the recent banking crisis, have a much greater influence on the weighted-average charge-off rate than do charge-off rates from the years before the crisis, when few failures occurred. The weighted averages assure that types of loans that have high charge-off rates during downturns (i.e., periods marked by significant DIF losses) have an appropriate influence on assessment rates. Table 13-23 illustrates how the loan mix index is calculated for a hypothetical bank.

The weighted charge-off rates in Table 13-23 are the same for all established small banks. The remaining two columns vary from bank to bank, depending on the bank's loan portfolio. For each loan type, the value in the rightmost column is calculated by multiplying the weighted charge-off rate by the bank's loans of that type as a percent of its total assets. In this illustration, the sum of the right-hand column (84.91) is the loan mix index for this bank.

Table 13-24 sets out the pricing multipliers and uniform amounts that result when the FDIC converts the statistical model to the assessment rate schedule set out in Table 7 (with a range of assessment rates from 3 basis points to 30 basis points). Weights for the CAMELS components to calculate the weighted average CAMELS rating are 25 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, 10 percent, 10 percent, and 10 percent for C, A, M, E, L, and S component, respectively (same as in previous rules).

As described earlier, because the 2016 rule eliminates risk categories and applies the financial ratios method to all established small banks, and uses some new measures, the multipliers assigned to the financial measures are necessarily different from the multipliers in the 2011 Risk Category I financial ratios method. In sum, the financial ratios method in the 2016 rule, including the multipliers assigned to the financial measures and weighted average CAMELS component ratings, predicts failures significantly better than the 2011 system.

# APPENDIX 13B: Calculating Minimum Required Reserves at U.S. Depository Institutions

# cash reserves

Vault cash and cash deposits held at the Federal Reserve.

# transaction accounts

Deposits that permit the account holders to make multiple withdrawals.

This appendix presents a detailed example of U.S. bank liquidity management under the current minimum reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve. Many of the issues and trade-offs are readily generalizable, however, to any FI facing liability withdrawal risk under conditions in which regulators impose minimum liquid asset reserve ratios. The issues involved in the optimal management of a liquid asset portfolio are illustrated using problems faced by the money desk manager in charge of a U.S. bank's cash reserve position. In the context of U.S. bank regulation, we concentrate on a bank's management of its cash reserves, defined as vault cash and cash deposits held at the Federal Reserve.

Transaction accounts include all deposits on which an account holder may make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments and may make more than three monthly telephone or preauthorized fund transfers for the purpose of making payments to third parties (for example, demand deposits, NOW accounts, and share draft accounts—offered by credit unions). Historically, U.S. banks also had to hold reserves against time deposits and personal savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts—MMDAs). However, this was reduced from 3 percent to 0 percent at the beginning of 1991. Transaction account balances are reduced by demand deposit balances due from U.S. depository institutions (used primarily to purchase services from those institutions, such as check collection, check processing, and fed funds trading) and cash items in process of collection (checks written against accounts at other institutions that have been deposited at the bank). Credit is given to the depositor of these checks only after they clear to obtain net transaction accounts.

To calculate the target amount of reserves and to determine whether the bank is holding too many or too few reserves, the bank reserve manager requires two additional pieces of information to manage the position. First, which period's deposits does the manager use to compute the bank's reserve requirement? Second, over which period or periods must the bank maintain the target reserve requirement just computed? The U.S. system is complicated by the fact that the period for which the bank manager computes the required reserve target differs from the period during which the reserve target is maintained or achieved. We describe the computation and maintenance periods for bank reserves next.

# reserve computation period

Period over which required reserves are calculated.

# Computation Period

For the purposes of bank reserve management, a U.S. bank reserve manager must think of the year as being divided into two-week periods. The reserve computation period always begins on a Tuesday and ends on a Monday 14 days later.

# EXAMPLE 13-2 Computation of Daily Average Required Reserves

Consider ABC Bank's reserve manager, who wants to assess the bank's minimum cash reserve requirement target. The manager knows the bank's net transaction accounts balance at the close of the banking day on each of the 14 days over the period Tuesday, June 30, to Monday, July 13. Consider the realized net transaction account positions of ABC Bank in Table 13-25.

The minimum daily average reserves that a bank must maintain is computed as a percentage of the daily average net transaction accounts held by the bank over the two-week computation period, where Friday's balances are carried over for Saturday and Sunday. The minimum daily average for ABC Bank to hold against the daily average of 1,350.70 million in net transaction accounts is calculated as follows (amounts in millions):

Daily average net transaction accounts  $\times$  Reserve percentage  $=$  Daily average reserves required

<table><tr><td>$15.2</td><td>0\%</td><td>$ 0.000</td></tr><tr><td>$110.2-$15.2</td><td>3</td><td>2.850</td></tr><tr><td>$1,350.7-$110.2</td><td>10</td><td>124.050</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Minimum average reserves to be held</td><td>126.900</td></tr></table>

# weekend game

Name given to the policy of lowering deposit balances on Fridays, since that day's figures count three times for reserve accounting purposes.

Note that the daily average target in Example 13-2 is calculated by taking a 14-day average of net transaction accounts even though the bank is closed for 4 of the 14 days (two Saturdays and two Sundays). Effectively, Friday's deposit figures count three times compared to those of other days in the business week. This means that the bank manager who can engage in a strategy in which deposits are lower on Fridays can, on average, lower the bank's reserve requirements. This may be important if required liquid asset reserve holdings are above the optimal level from the bank's perspective to handle liquidity drains due to expected and unexpected deposit withdrawals.

One strategy employed in the past was for a bank to send deposits out of the country (e.g., transfer them to a foreign subsidiary) on a Friday, when a reduction in deposits effectively counts for 3/14 of the two-week period, and to bring them back on the following Monday, when an increase counts for only 1/14 of the two-week period. This action effectively reduced the average demand deposits on the balance sheet of the bank over the 14-day period by 2/14 times the amount sent out of the country and, thus, reduced the amount of reserves it needed to hold. Analysts term this the weekend game.

Note that the 126.900 million figure is a minimum reserve target. The bank manager may hold excess cash reserves above this minimum level if the privately optimal or prudent level for the bank exceeds the regulatory specified minimum level because this bank is especially exposed to deposit withdrawal risk. In addition, the bank manager may hold some buffer reserves in the form of government securities that can quickly be turned into cash if deposit withdrawals are unusually high or to preempt the early stages of a bank run.

# reserve maintenance period

Period over which deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank must meet or exceed the required reserve target.

# Maintenance Period

We have computed a daily average minimum cash reserve requirement for ABC Bank, but have yet to delineate the exact period over which the bank manager must maintain this 126.900 million daily average reserve target. Reserves may be held either as vault cash or as deposits held by the bank at the Federal Reserve. Under the current set of regulations, the average daily vault cash held during the reserve computation period (June 30 through July 13 in our example) is deducted from the institution's required reserves to determine the reserve balance to be maintained at the Federal Reserve. In addition, a lag of 30 days exists between the beginning of the reserve computation period and the beginning of the reserve maintenance period (over which deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank must meet or exceed the required reserve target). For ABC Bank, this reserve maintenance period is from July 30 through August 12 (see Figure 13-5). Thus, the bank's reserve manager knows the value of its target reserves with perfect certainty throughout the reserve maintenance period. However, the reserve manager still has a challenge in maintaining sufficient reserves at the Fed to hit the reserve target, while still minimizing these low interest rate balances and maintaining the liquidity position of the bank.

The reserve manager also knows the vault cash component of the reserve target, since this is based on the average vault cash held by the bank over the reserve computation period, as reported in Table 13-25. The daily balances in deposits at the Federal Reserve for ABC Bank for the 14-day reserve maintenance period from July 30 through August 12 are shown in Table 13-26. Since the average daily balance in vault cash during the reserve

# contemporaneous reserve accounting system

An accounting system in which the reserve computation and reserve maintenance periods overlap.

computation period is shown (in Table 13-25) at  \$25.357 million, the average daily target balance for deposits at the Federal Reserve are\$ 101.543 million (i.e., \$25.357 million + \$101.543 million = \$126.900 million). Essentially, since the vault cash component of the reserve target is based on vault cash held over the reserve computation period, the bank's active target during the maintenance period itself is its reserve position at the Fed (in this case, it seeks to hold an average of \$101.543 million per day over the 14-day maintenance period).

As discussed earlier, currently the reserve maintenance period for meeting the reserve target begins 30 days after the start of the reserve computation period—the reserve maintenance period does not begin until 17 days after the end of the computation period. Regulators introduced this lagged reserve accounting system to make it easier for bank reserve managers to calculate their required reserve balances and to increase the accuracy of information on aggregate required reserve balances. Prior to July 1998, regulators used a contemporaneous reserve accounting system in which the two-week reserve maintenance period for meeting the reserve target began only two days (as opposed to the current 30 days) after the start of the reserve computation period. This contemporaneous reserve system resulted in only a two-day window during which required reserves were known with certainty—in the previous example, the reserve maintenance period would have been from Thursday, July 2, through Wednesday, July 15, for a reserve computation period beginning Tuesday, June 30, and ending Monday, July 13.
