# OTHER LENDING INSTITUTIONS: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Like commercial banks, the main financial service provided by savings institutions, credit unions, and finance companies is lending. Savings institutions (SIs) were created in the early 1800s in response to commercial banks' concentration on serving the needs of business (commercial) enterprises rather than the needs of individuals requiring borrowed funds to purchase homes. Thus, the first SIs pooled individual savings and invested them mainly in mortgages and other securities. While today's SIs generally perform services similar to commercial banks, they are still grouped separately because they provide important residential mortgage lending and other financial services to households. That is, savings institutions concentrate primarily on residential mortgage lending. However, these institutions

LG 14-1 have recently operated in a slightly more diversified way, with a large concentration of residential mortgage assets but holding commercial loans, corporate bonds, and corporate stock as well. Credit unions are nonprofit depository institutions mutually organized and owned by their members (depositors). Credit unions have historically focused on consumer loans funded with member deposits. Savings institutions and credit unions together are often referred to as thrifts.

The primary function of finance companies is also to make loans to both individuals and businesses. Finance companies provide such services as consumer lending, business lending, and mortgage financing. Some finance company loans (e.g., commercial and auto loans) are similar to commercial bank loans, but others are aimed at relatively specialized areas such as high-risk (low credit quality) loans to small businesses and consumers. As we discuss in the chapter, finance companies are often willing to lend to riskier customers than are commercial banks and thrifts, and they sometimes offer rates well below those offered by depository institutions. Thus, they compete directly with depository institutions for loan customers. However, unlike banks and thrifts, finance companies do not accept deposits; instead, they rely on shortand long-term debt for funding.

The first major finance company was originated during the Depression when General Electric Corp. created General Electric Capital Corp. (GECC) to finance appliance sales to cash-strapped customers unable to obtain installment credit from banks. By the late 1950s, banks had become more willing to make installment loans, so finance companies began looking outside their parent companies for business. GE Capital was a cash cow to GE throughout much of the 1990s and 2000s. At its peak in 2008, it contributed nearly 60 percent of GE's overall profits and had more than  $600 billion in assets ranging from commercial real estate to Thai auto loans. GE Capital's exposure to the financial crisis resulted in General Electric Corp.'s market value falling by more than half during 2008. The parent company's stock price fell to$ 14.58 in November 2008, its lowest level since January 1997. In order to reassure investors and help the GE Capital unit compete with banks that already had government protection behind their debt, on November 12, 2008, the FDIC approved GE Capital's application for designation as an eligible entity under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). Granting this finance company access to the FDIC program was possible because GE Capital also owns a federal savings bank and an industrial loan company, both of which qualified for FDIC assistance. However, the move to operate as a Federal Reserve-regulated bank proved to be a burden to GECC. In April 2015, GE announced the GE Capital Exit Plan to reduce the size of its financial services businesses through the sale of most of the assets of GECC over the following 24 months. Under the GE Capital Exit Plan, GE retained only certain GECC businesses, principally its vertical financing businesses—GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), Energy Financial Services (EFS), and Healthcare Equipment Finance—that directly relate to GE's core industrial domain and other operations (together referred to as GE Capital Verticals or Verticals). The assets planned for disposition included real estate, most of commercial lending and leasing (CLL), and all consumer platforms (including all U.S. banking assets). GE completed the Capital Exit Plan in March 2017 by closing the sale of its consumer finance business in France. As of December 2019, GE Capital assets total $118 billion, down from over $600 billion in 2008.

This chapter discusses the size, structure, and composition of the savings institution, credit union, and finance company industries, the services they provide, their competitive and financial position, and their regulation.

# SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS

# Size, Structure, and Composition of the Industry

Savings institutions comprise two groups of depository institutions: savings associations and savings banks. Historically, the industry consisted of only savings associations (referred to as savings and loan [S&L] associations). However, in the 1980s, federally

chartered savings banks appeared in the United States. These two types of institutions have the same regulators and regulations as the traditional savings and loans. Together they are referred to as savings institutions.

The S&L Crisis of 1982-1992. Savings institutions are specialized institutions that make long-term residential mortgage loans, usually funded with the short-term deposits of small savers. In the mid-1980s, real estate and land prices in Texas and the Southwest collapsed. This was followed by economic downturns in the Northeast and Western states of the United States. Many borrowers with mortgage loans issued by savings institutions in these areas defaulted. In other words, the risks incurred by many of these institutions did not pay off. This risk-taking behavior was accentuated by the policies of the federal insurer of savings associations' deposits, the FSLIC. It chose not to close capital-depleted, economically insolvent savings institutions (a policy of regulatory forbearance) and to maintain deposit insurance premium assessments independent of the risk taken by the institution (see Chapter 13). As a result, an alarming number (919) of savings institution failures occurred in the 1984-1993 period (peaking at 325 in 1989), alongside a rapid decline in asset growth of the industry. Figure 14-1 shows the number of failures, mergers, and new charters of savings institutions from 1984 through 2019. Notice the large number of failures from 1987 through 1992 and the decline in the number of new charters.

In the 1980s, the large number of savings institution failures depleted the resources of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to such an extent that by

2. The term savings association has replaced S&L to capture the change in the structure of the industry. In 1978, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), at the time the main regulator of savings associations, began chartering federal savings banks insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). In 1982, the FHLBB allowed S&Ls to convert to federal savings banks with bank (rather than S&L) names. As more and more S&Ls converted to savings banks, the title associated with this sector of the thrift industry was revised to reflect this change.

# QTL test

Qualified thrift lender test that sets a floor on the mortgage-related assets that thrifts can hold (currently, 65 percent).

1989 it was massively insolvent. As a result, Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989. This legislation abolished the FSLIC and created a new Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) under the management of the FDIC (with the help of a 100 billion infusion of funds by the U.S. government). FIRREA also replaced the Federal Home Loan Bank Board with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) as the main regulator of federally chartered savings institutions. In addition, the act created the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to close and liquidate the most insolvent savings institutions. FIRREA also strengthened the capital requirements of savings institutions and constrained their non-mortgage-related asset investment powers under a revised qualified thrift lender test, or QTL test (discussed below). Following FIRREA, Congress further enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The FDICIA of 1991 introduced risk-based deposit insurance premiums (starting in 1993) in an attempt to limit excessive risk taking by savings institution managers. It also introduced a prompt corrective action (PCA) policy, enabling regulators to close thrifts and banks faster (see Chapter 13).

As a result of closing weak savings institutions and strengthening their capital requirements, the industry is now significantly smaller in terms of both numbers and asset size. Specifically, the number of savings institutions decreased from 3,677 in 1989 to 2,262 in 1993 (by 38 percent) and assets decreased from  $1.427 trillion to$ 1.001 trillion (by 30 percent) over the same period. By 2019, the number of savings institutions continued to decrease to 659 and the industry's assets had slightly increased to 1.154 trillion.

# Balance Sheets and Recent Trends

LG 14-2

Even in its new smaller state, the future viability of the savings institution industry in traditional mortgage lending areas is a matter of debate. This is due partly to intense competition for mortgages from other financial institutions such as commercial banks and specialized mortgage bankers. It is also due to the securitization of mortgages into mortgage-backed security pools by government-sponsored enterprises, which we discuss in Chapters 7 and 25. In addition, long-term mortgage lending exposes FIs to significant credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks.

The largest U.S. savings institution as of 2019 was Charles Schwab Bank (with total assets of  $217 billion), followed by Synchrony Bank (total assets$ 91 billion) and USAA Federal Savings Banks (total assets $89 billion). Recall from Chapter 11 that the top four commercial banks each had assets of over $1 trillion in 2019. Thus, the savings institution industry is much smaller in size and market power than the commercial banking industry. Table 14-1 shows the balance sheet for the savings institution industry in 2019. On this balance sheet, mortgages (28.1 percent) and mortgage-backed securities (32.3 percent) represent 60.4 percent of portfolio assets. Portfolio assets are defined as total assets minus office property, goodwill, and other intangibles, and the lesser of the 20 percent of total assets or liquid assets. As noted earlier, FIRREA uses the QTL test to establish a minimum holding of 65 percent in mortgage-related assets for savings institutions. In addition to mortgage-related assets, credit card loans are includable as part of QTL. In 2019, savings institutions' credit card loans totaled 10.6 percent of portfolio assets, bringing QTL qualifying assets to a total of 71 percent of portfolio assets. As of December 2019, loans secured by real estate amounted to 38.5 percent of savings institution assets compared to 27.1 percent at commercial banks, commercial and industrial loans were only 3.8 percent of assets compared to 11.8 percent at commercial banks, and loans to individuals amounted to 12.3 percent of assets compared to 9.9 percent at commercial banks (see Tables 14-1 and 11-1). Finally, savings institutions are required to hold cash

and investment securities for liquidity purposes and to meet regulator-imposed reserve requirements (see Chapter 13). In 2019, investment securities (U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. government obligations, domestic debt securities, foreign debt securities, and equity securities) holdings amounted to 33.4 percent of total assets compared to 21.4 percent at commercial banks.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, transaction accounts (equivalent to those at commercial banks), and small time and savings deposits are the predominant source of funds, with total deposits accounting for 79.8 percent of total liabilities and net worth. This compares to 78.0 percent at commercial banks. The second most important source of funds is borrowing from the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which the institutions themselves own. Because of their size and government-sponsored status, FHLBs have access to the wholesale capital market for notes and bonds and can relend the funds borrowed in these markets to savings institutions at a small markup over wholesale cost. Other borrowed funds also include repurchase agreements and direct federal fund borrowings.

Finally, net worth is the book value of the equity holders' capital contribution; it amounted to 10.8 percent in 2019. This compares to 11.3 percent at commercial banks. Historically, most savings institutions were established as mutual organizations (in which the depositors are the legal owners of the institution and no stock is issued). As a mutual organization, member deposits represent the equity of the savings institution. Since they have no stockholders, and thus no demand for equity investment returns, mutual organizations are generally less risky than stock-chartered organizations—mutual savings institution managers can concentrate on low-risk investments and the prevention of failure rather than higher-risk investments needed to produce higher required returns on stockholders' investments. However, through time many savings institutions have switched from mutual to stock charters (in which the holders of the stock or equity are the legal owners of the institution rather than depositors as under the mutual charter). This is mainly because stock ownership allows savings institutions to attract capital investment from outside stockholders beyond levels achievable at a mutual institution. As of 2019, 53.0 percent of all savings institutions were stock chartered, comprising 88.5 percent of industry assets.

# Regulators

LG 14-3

The main regulators of savings institutions are the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FDIC, and state regulators.

www.occ.gov

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In 1989, FIRREA established the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). This office chartered and examined all federal savings institutions. It also supervised the holding companies of savings institutions. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis the U.S. Congress determined that the performance of savings bank regulators was relatively weak compared to commercial bank regulators. Further, a Government Accountability Office report noted that some of the savings institutions regulated by the OTS were primarily operating in areas other than those traditionally engaged in by thrifts (i.e., insurance, securities, and commercial activities). To address these concerns, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 mandated the consolidation of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. As a result, the OTS became part of the OCC on July 21, 2011, and on October 19, 2011, the OTS ceased to exist. Thus, the OCC now regulates both national banks and federal savings institutions. Additionally, while the bill did not eliminate the charter for savings institutions dedicated to mortgage lending, it did subject savings institution holding companies to supervision by the Federal Reserve.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

5. Who the regulators of savings institutions are?

The FDIC. Also established in 1989 under FIRREA and in the wake of the FSLIC insolvency, the FDIC oversaw and managed the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). In 1996, as part of a plan to recapitalize the SAIF, commercial banks were required to pay for part of the burden. In return, Congress promised to eventually merge bank and thrift charters (and hence insurance funds) into one. In January 2007, the FDIC merged the SAIF and the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) to form the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Thus, savings institutions now operate under the same regulatory structure that applies to commercial banks.

Other Regulators. State-chartered savings institutions are regulated by state agencies—for example, the Office of Banks and Real Estate in Illinois—rather than the OCC.

# Savings Institution Recent Performance

LG 14-4

Like commercial banks, savings institutions experienced record profits in the midto late 1990s as interest rates (and thus the cost of funds to savings institutions) remained low and the U.S. economy (and thus the demand for loans) prospered. The result was an increase in the spread between interest income and interest expense for savings institutions and consequently an increase in net income. In 1999, savings institutions reported  $10.7 billion in net income and an annualized ROA of 1.00 percent. Only the$ 10.8 billion of net income reported in 1998 exceeded these results. Asset quality improvements were widespread during 1999, providing the most favorable net operating income that the industry had ever reported. However, the downturn in the U.S. economy resulted in a decline in savings institutions' profitability in 2000. Specifically, their ROA and ROE ratios fell slightly in 2000 to 0.92 percent and 11.14 percent, respectively, from their 1999 levels. Despite an economic recession, this downturn was short-lived. Both ROA and ROE increased to record levels each year from 2001 through 2003. One reason for this trend was that in the early 2000s, the industry's net interest margins rose; the cost of funding earning assets declined by 2.70 percent, while the yield

on earning assets declined by only 2.35 percent. A flat (and at times even downward sloping) yield curve increased funding costs and contributed to decreased margins in the mid-2000s. The average ROA declined to 1.15 percent in 2005 and 0.99 percent in 2006, while ROE decreased to 10.40 percent in 2005 and 8.68 percent in 2006.

In the late 2000s, as the U.S. economy experienced its strongest recession since the Great Depression, savings institutions' performance deteriorated. For all of 2007, net income was  $6.0 billion, down$ 11.1 billion from 2006. The average ROA for the year was 0.13 percent, the lowest yearly average since 1989. In 2008, net income was -$8.6 billion. This was the first negative earnings year since 1991. The ROA for the year was -0.72 percent. However, only five savings institutions failed or were assisted during the year. In this group was Washington Mutual, the largest savings institution, with over $300 billion in assets. Like commercial banks, as the economy improved in the second half of 2009 through 2013, so did savings institutions' performance. Savings institutions earned $1.4 billion in net income in the third quarter of 2009, up from -$18.3 million in the second quarter. This trend continued into 2010 as savings institutions earned 8.3 billion for the year. ROA and ROE for the industry were 0.65 percent and 5.76 percent, respectively, up from 0.14 percent and 1.31 percent, respectively, in 2009. By 2019, the industry ROA was 1.36 percent and ROE was 12.41 percent. Further, only one savings institution failed in 2019. Table 14-2 presents several performance ratios for the industry from 1989 through 2019.

Also like commercial banks, the savings institution industry experienced substantial consolidation in the 1990s and 2000s. Figure 14-2 shows the industry consolidation in number and asset size over the period 1992-2019. Over this period, the biggest savings institutions (over 10 billion) grew in number from 0.3 percent to 2.3 percent of the industry and their control of industry assets grew from 17.9 percent to 58.8 percent.

# CREDIT UNIONS

LG 14-5

Credit unions (CUs) are nonprofit depository institutions mutually organized and owned by their members (depositors). They were established in the United States in the early 1900s as self-help organizations. The first credit unions were organized in the Northeast, initially in Massachusetts. Members paid an entrance fee and put up funds to purchase at least one deposit share. Members were expected to deposit their savings in the CU, and these funds were lent only to other members.

This limit in the customer base of CUs continues today as, unlike commercial banks and savings institutions, CUs are prohibited from serving the general public. Rather, in organizing a credit union, members are required to have a common bond of occupation (e.g., police CUs); association (e.g., university-affiliated CUs); or cover a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district. CUs may, however, have multiple groups with more than one type of membership. Each credit union decides the common bond requirements (i.e., which groups it will serve) with the approval of the appropriate regulator (see below). To join a credit union an individual must then be a member of the approved group(s).

The primary objective of credit unions is to satisfy the depository and borrowing needs of their members. CU member deposits (called shares, representing ownership stakes in the CU) are used to provide loans to other members in need of funds. Earnings from these loans are used to pay interest on member deposits. Because credit unions are nonprofit organizations, their earnings are not taxed. This tax-exempt status allows CUs to offer higher rates on deposits and charge lower rates on some types of loans compared to banks and savings institutions, whose earnings are taxable. This is shown in Table 14-3 for December 2019.

# Size, Structure, and Composition of the Industry

Credit unions are the most numerous of the institutions (5,236 in 2019) that compose the depository institutions segment of the FI industry. Moreover, CUs were less affected by the crisis that affected commercial banks and savings institutions in the 1980s and late 2000s. This is because traditionally more than 40 percent of their assets have been in small consumer loans, often for amounts less than 10,000, which are funded mainly by member deposits. This combination of relatively matched credit risk and maturity in the asset and liability portfolios left credit unions less exposed to credit and interest rate risk than commercial banks and savings institutions. CUs' lending activities are funded mainly by deposits contributed by their over 120.4 million members.

The nation's credit union system consists of three distinct tiers: the top tier at the national level (U.S. Central Credit Union); the middle tier at the state or regional level (corporate credit unions); and the bottom tier at the local level (credit unions). Corporate credit unions are financial institutions that are cooperatively owned by their member credit unions. As of June 2019, there were 11 corporate credit unions with assets of 23 billion. These 11 corporate credit unions serve their members primarily by investing and lending excess funds (unloaned deposits) that member credit unions place with them. Additional services provided by corporate credit unions include automated settlement, securities safe-keeping, data processing, accounting, and payment services. As of June 2019, the share of CUs with corporate credit union capital is over 80 percent. The U.S. Central Credit Union serves as a "corporate's corporate"—providing investment and liquidity services to corporate credit unions. The Central Credit Union acts as the main provider of liquidity for corporate credit unions. It invests their surplus funds and provides financial services and operational support.

In recent years, to attract and keep customers, CUs have expanded their services to compete with commercial banks and savings institutions. For example, CUs now offer mortgages, credit lines, and mobile banking. Some credit unions also offer business and commercial loans to their employer groups. In 2019, commercial loans represented 7 percent of the industry's lending.

As CUs have expanded in membership, size, and services, bankers claim that CUs unfairly compete with small banks that have historically been the major lender in small towns and local communities. In 1997, the banking industry filed two lawsuits in its push to restrict the growing competitive threat from credit unions. The first lawsuit (filed by four North Carolina banks and the American Bankers Association) challenged an occupation-based credit union's (the AT&T Family Credit Union based in North Carolina) ability to accept members from companies unrelated to the firm that originally sponsored the credit union. In the second lawsuit, the American Bankers Association asked the courts to bar the federal government from allowing occupation-based credit unions to convert to community-based charters. Bankers argued in both lawsuits that such actions, broadening the membership base of credit unions, would further exploit an unfair advantage allowed through the credit union tax-exempt status. In February 1998, the Supreme Court sided with the banks in its decision that credit unions could no longer accept members that were not a part of the "common bond" of membership. In April 1998, however, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that allowed all existing members to keep their credit union accounts. The bill was passed by the Senate in July 1998 and signed into law by the president in August 1998. This legislation allowed CUs not only to keep their existing members but also to accept new groups of members—including small businesses and low-income communities—that were not considered part of the "common bond" of membership by the Supreme Court ruling.

Credit unions provide a public service by offering loans to those who might not otherwise have access to credit through commercial banks and savings institutions: lowand moderate-income individuals within a specific group—the credit union's common bond. Further, credit union profits are distributed back to members in the form of better rates on deposits and loans as well as lower and fewer fees on services. It is these services that have justified credit unions' tax-exempt status. However, throughout the 2000s, many credit unions pursued regional charters and expanded their fields of membership. The result has been a blurring of credit unions' common bond membership. Consequently, credit unions have become more like banks, but with tax-exempt status. As credit unions have grown in size, some are again questioning their protected status. Indeed, in a recent report from the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, elimination of the credit union tax exemption was included in a list of recommendations addressing the nation's budget deficit. Yet, despite the renewed discussion, credit unions continue to operate as nonprofit, tax-exempt depository institutions.

In another hit to commercial banks, credit unions saw record increases in membership in late 2011 and early 2012, with most of the increase coming from commercial bank customers. For the year ending June 30, 2012, credit union membership increased by nearly 2.2 million new members: almost twice the 1.2 million average annual growth experienced in similar 12-month periods over the previous 10 years and four times greater than the 550,000 new members over that same period the prior year. Much of the growth in membership occurred as a part of nationwide campaigns, such as Bank Transfer Day on November 5, 2011, that encouraged consumers to leave their "big" banks for credit unions and community banks, which tend to incur fewer fees. Among the catalysts for these campaigns was Bank of America's plan to impose a monthly fee for debit card use. That plan was scrapped in response to consumers' strong negative reactions.

# Balance Sheets and Recent Trends

LG 14-6

As of 2019, 5,236 credit unions had assets of  $1.57 trillion. This compares to$ 192.8 billion in assets in 1988. Individually, credit unions tend to be very small, with an average asset size of $299 million in 2019, compared to $3,601.6 million for banks. The total assets of all credit unions are smaller than the largest U.S. banking organization(s). For example, in 2019, JPMorgan Chase had $2.34 trillion in total assets, Bank of America had $1.85 trillion, Wells Fargo had $1.71 trillion, and Citigroup had $1.45 trillion. The largest U.S. credit union as of 2019 was Navy Federal Credit Union (with total assets of $111.9 billion and over 8.9 million members), followed by State Employees Credit Union (with total assets of $41.3 billion and 2.4 million members) and PenFed Federal Credit Union (with total assets of 24.7 billion and 1.9 million members).

Table 14-4 shows the breakdown of financial assets and liabilities for credit unions as of 2019. Given their emphasis on retail or consumer lending, as discussed earlier, 28.5 percent of CU assets are in the form of small consumer loans (compared to 12.3 percent at savings institutions and 9.9 percent at commercial banks) and another 30.7 percent are in the form of 1-4 family home mortgages (compared to 21.9 percent at savings institutions and 13.1 percent at commercial banks). Together, these member loans comprise 59.2 percent of total assets. Because of the common bond requirement on credit union customers, few business or commercial loans are issued by CUs.

Credit unions also invest in investment securities (16.8 percent of total assets in 2019 compared to 33.4 percent at savings institutions and 21.4 percent at commercial banks). Table 14-4 shows that 30.3 percent of the investment portfolio has maturity of less than 1 year, and 34.9 percent has maturity of 1 to 3 years. Their investment

Credit union funding comes mainly from member deposits (84.2 percent of total funding in 2019 compared to 79.8 percent for savings institutions and 78.0 percent for commercial banks). Figure 14-3 presents the distribution of these deposits in 2019. Regular share accounts (similar to passbook savings accounts at other depository institutions, but so named to designate the deposit holders' ownership status) accounted for 33.7 percent of all CU deposits, followed by money market deposit accounts (20.8 percent of deposits), certificates of deposit (21.8 percent), and share draft transaction accounts (similar to NOW accounts at other depository institutions—see Chapter 11) (15.8 percent of deposits). Credit unions hold lower levels of equity than other depository institutions. Since CUs are not stockholder owned, this equity is basically the accumulation of past earnings from CU activities that is "owned" collectively by member depositors. As will be discussed in Chapters 20 and 23, this equity protects a CU against losses on its loan portfolio as well as other financial and operating risks. In 2019, CUs' capital-to-assets ratio was 11.4 percent compared to 10.8 percent for savings institutions and 11.3 percent for commercial banks.

# Regulators

Like commercial banks and savings institutions, credit unions can be federally or state chartered. As of 2019, 63.7 percent of the 5,236 CUs were federally chartered and subject to National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulation, accounting for 51.5 percent of the total membership and 49.9 percent of total assets. The NCUA is an independent federal agency that charters, supervises, examines, and insures the nation's credit unions. In addition, through its insurance fund (the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, or NCUSIF), the NCUA provides deposit insurance guarantees of up to 250,000 for insured state and federal credit unions. Currently, the NCUSIF covers 98 percent of all credit union deposits. The fund's reserves come entirely from premiums paid by member credit unions.

# Industry Performance

Like other depository institutions, the credit union industry has grown in asset size in the 1990s and 2000s. Asset growth from 1999 to 2019 was more than 6.9 percent annually. In addition, CU membership increased from 77.5 million to over 107.6 million 120.4 million over the 1999-2019 period. Asset growth was especially pronounced among the largest CUs (with assets of over 100 million) as their assets increased by almost 20 percent annually from 1999 through 2019. Figure 14-4 shows the trend in ROA for CUs from 1993 through 2016. ROA for the industry was 0.94 in 2019. Larger CUs generally outperform small CUs. For example, the largest credit unions experienced an ROA of 1.04 percent in 2019, while ROA for the smallest credit unions was 0.30 percent. Smaller CUs generally have a smaller and less diversified customer base and have higher overhead expenses per dollar of assets. Thus, their ROAs have been hurt.

Given the mutual-ownership status of this industry, however, growth in ROA (or profits) is not necessarily the primary goal of CUs. Rather, as long as capital or equity levels are sufficient to protect a CU against unexpected losses on its credit portfolio as well as other financial and operational risks, this nonprofit industry has a primary goal of serving the deposit and lending needs of its members. This contrasts with the emphasis placed on profitability by stockholder-owned commercial banks and savings institutions.

While local credit unions as a whole survived the financial crisis more profitably than commercial banks and savings institutions, corporate credit unions did not. As mentioned earlier, corporate credit unions serve their members by investing and lending excess funds that member credit unions place with them. Like commercial banks, in the earlyand mid-2000s, corporate credit unions faced increasingly tough business conditions that strained their financial position. To generate earnings, some corporate credit unions invested in riskier securities, such as mortgage-related and asset-backed securities. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) allowed corporate credit unions to invest in these higher risk securities. As the financial crisis hit, corporate credit unions that invested in higher risk securities started experiencing large losses on them. These corporate credit unions reported 18 billion in unrealized losses on securities, as of November 2008.

As information about the financial conditions of these corporate credit unions became public, local credit unions reduced their exposure to the corporates. Between March 31, 2008, and September 30, 2008, local credit unions' deposits in corporate credit unions fell by nearly 49 percent, from  $44.7 billion to$ 22.9 billion. In addition to the resulting demand for funds that this withdrawal of deposits produced, these corporate credit unions had accumulated 50 billion in toxic mortgage-backed securities. The corporate credit union system started to collapse. Without action, losses on these problem assets would have caused the entire credit union industry to break down.

As a first step in its effort to resolve the crisis, in March 2009 the NCUA placed two corporates, U.S. Central and WesCorp, into conservatorship. Further, the NCUA purchased many of the toxic assets of the corporates. As of the third quarter 2010, the NCUA held roughly 70 percent of the assets of the corporate credit union system, which included $50 billion in toxic assets. The NCUA also took several actions to address long-term issues surrounding corporate credit unions. Capital standards were increased and minimum retained earnings levels were established. Further, prompt corrective action requirements were increased. Investments in private label residential mortgage-backed securities and subordinated securities were prohibited, and concentration limits were set on investments. Ultimately, five of the largest corporate credit unions in the United States (Constitution Corporate, Members of United Corporate, Western Corporate, Southwest Corporate, and U.S. Central Corporate) were declared insolvent. The NCUA joined the U.S. Department of Justice and other governmental plaintiffs in litigation against several financial institutions, alleging they sold faulty mortgage-backed securities to four corporate credit unions. A number of settlement agreements were reached and the NCUA was the first federal financial institutions regulator to recover losses from investments in these securities on behalf of failed financial institutions. As of June 30, 2017, the NCUA's recoveries from the five failed corporate credit unions reached more than $5.1 billion. The Federal Credit Union Act and the NCUA's Rules and Regulations require that net proceeds from these recoveries are used to pay claimants against the liquidated corporate credit unions, including the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund. These payments to the Stabilization Fund have permitted repayment of the NCUA's outstanding U.S. Treasury borrowings and have decreased the amount credit unions ultimately pay for costs of resolving the five failed corporate credit unions. Repayment of borrowed amounts with interest also ensures no cost to U.S. taxpayers. The NCUA repaid the Treasury in full on October 31, 2016.

# Size, Structure, and Composition of the Industry

In 2019, the finance company industry assets stood at 1,503.6 billion (see Table 14-5). The three major types of finance companies are (1) sales finance institutions, (2) personal credit institutions, and (3) business credit institutions. Sales finance institutions (e.g., Ford Motor Credit and Toyota Motor Credit) specialize in making loans to customers of a specific retailer or manufacturer. Because sales finance institutions can frequently process loans faster and more conveniently (generally at the location of purchase) than depository institutions, this sector of the industry competes directly with depository institutions for consumer loans. Personal credit institutions (e.g., HSBC Finance Corp. and Synchrony Financial) specialize in making installment and other loans to consumers. Personal credit institutions will make loans to customers with low income or a bad credit history, in contrast to depository institutions, which find these customers too risky to lend to. These institutions compensate for the additional risk by charging higher interest rates than depository institutions and/or accepting collateral (e.g., used cars) that depository institutions do not find acceptable. Business credit institutions (e.g., IBM Global Financing and GE Capital Global Holdings) provide financing to corporations, especially through equipment leasing and factoring, in which the finance company purchases accounts receivable from corporate customers at a discount from face value and the finance company assumes the responsibility for collecting the accounts receivable. As a result, the corporate customer no longer has the worry of whether the accounts receivable may be delayed and thus receives cash for sales faster than the time it takes customers to pay their bills. Many large finance companies perform all three services.

The industry is quite concentrated; large firms with assets of 20 billion or more (which represents less than 0.5 percent of all finance companies) accounting for more than 71 percent of its assets, according to the latest Census of Finance Companies. In addition, many of the largest finance companies such as Ford Motor Credit tend to be

A major role of a captive finance company is to provide financing for the purchase of products manufactured by the parent, as Ford Motor Credit does for Ford Motor Company cars. Captive finance companies serve as an efficient marketing tool by providing consumer financing to customers of the parent company immediately at the time of purchase. They can also be used to finance distribution or dealer inventories until a sale occurs.

Table 14-6 lists some of the top finance companies (in terms of receivables, or loans outstanding) as of 2019. Ford Motor Credit Company is the largest with receivables totaling  $114.3 billion, and Synchrony Financial is the second largest with receivables of$ 88.6 billion. While GECGH is still on the list with receivables of $18.7 billion, it was the largest finance company prior to 2014, with as much as $285.0 billion in receivables.

# Balance Sheets and Recent Trends

Assets. Finance companies provide three basic types of loans: real estate, consumer, and business. The assets and liabilities of finance companies in 2019 are presented in Table 14-5. Business and consumer loans (called accounts receivable) are major assets held by finance companies; they represent 79.2 percent of total assets. In 1975, 92.3 percent of total assets were consumer and business loans (see Figure 14-5). Compared to depository institutions, which hold a large percentage of longer-term real estate loans, finance companies historically held shorter-term consumer and business loans. Over the last 40 years, however, finance companies have replaced consumer and business loans with increasing amounts of real estate loans and other assets, although these loans have not become dominant, as is the case with many depository institutions. Real estate loans are 7.8 percent of total assets of finance companies.

Table 14-7 presents information concerning the industry's loans from 1997 through 2019 for consumer, real estate, and business lending. In recent years, the fastest-growing areas of asset activity have been in the nonconsumer finance areas, especially leasing and business lending. In 2019, consumer loans constituted 59.3 percent of all finance company loans, mortgages represented 9.5 percent, and business loans comprised 31.2 percent.

The entities cannot be a government agency, a nonprofit organization, a cooperative, a bank, a bank holding company, a credit union, or a real estate investment trust. Structurally, they can be a subsidiary of a bank holding company but not a subsidiary of a bank.

Consumer Loans. Consumer loans include motor vehicle loans and leases and other consumer loans. Motor vehicle loans and leases are traditionally the major type of consumer loan (70.3 percent of the consumer loan portfolio in 2019). Table 14-8 data indicate that finance companies historically charged higher rates for automobile loans than did commercial banks.

1.67 and 0.79 percent higher than those of commercial banks. Because new car sales by U.S. firms in 1997 through 1999 were lower than normal, finance companies owned by the major auto manufacturers slashed the interest rates charged on new car loans (some as low as 0.9 percent) over this period. Moreover, after the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the major auto manufacturers lowered new car rates to 0.0 percent in an attempt to boost sales. Some of these 0.0 percent rates continued to be offered into 2005 as the general level of interest rates remained low. The 2008-2009 financial crisis saw a resurrection of 0.0 percent car loan rates as auto manufacturers tried to boost slumping car sales. Notice that the difference between new car loans at commercial banks and finance companies continued to widen throughout the early 2000s. By 2003 finance companies were charging more than 3.53 percent less on new car loans than commercial banks, mainly due to the zero interest rates offered by the major auto manufacturers' captive finance company loans to new car buyers. It was not until 2013 that the historical trend returned

as finance companies charged an average rate on new car loans that was 0.24 percent higher than commercial banks. Other than for new auto loans, these types of low rates are rare. Other consumer loans include personal cash loans, mobile home loans, and loans to purchase other types of consumer goods such as appliances, apparel, general merchandise, and recreation vehicles.

Finance companies generally charge higher rates for consumer loans because they generally attract riskier customers than commercial banks. In fact, customers who seek individual (or business) loans from finance companies are often those who have been refused loans at banks or thrifts.[6] It is, in fact, possible for individuals to obtain a mortgage from a subprime lender finance company (a finance company that lends to high-risk customers) even with a bankruptcy in their credit records. Banks rarely make such loans. Most finance companies that offer these mortgages, however, charge rates commensurate with the higher risk, and a few loan shark finance companies prey on desperate consumers, charging exorbitant rates as high as 30 percent or more per year. These predatory lenders often target disadvantaged borrowers who are not aware of the risks they are undertaking with these loans. Predatory lending by loan sharks often leads to the bankruptcy of disadvantaged borrowers.

Another case of a subprime lender is the payday lender. Payday lenders provide short-term cash advances that are often due when borrowers receive their next paycheck. The payday lending industry originated from check cashing outlets in the early 1990s and exploded in the 2000s as demand for short-term loans rose. By 2019, about 23 million Americans took out at least one payday loan each year, and the industry lending volume topped  $90 billion. Across the United States, there are approximately 23,000 payday lenders, according to financial research company Moebs Services. A typical borrower takes out a two-week loan and pays$ 15 for every $100 borrowed, or the equivalent of a 390 percent annual interest rate. The typical customer earns between  $25,000 and50,000 per year. Critics claim that rates are exorbitant and often trap financially strapped borrowers in a cycle of paying additional fees to renew the same amount of principal. Lenders argue that the high rates are necessary to cover costs, offset higher default rates, and still earn a profit.

The payday loan industry is regulated at the state level. As of 2019, 20 states had effectively banned payday lending. When not explicitly banned, laws that prohibit payday lending are usually in the form of usury limits. Some payday lenders have succeeded in getting around usury laws in some states by forming relationships with nationally chartered banks based in a different state with no usury ceiling (such as South Dakota or Delaware). As federal banking regulators became aware of this practice, they began prohibiting these partnerships between commercial banks and payday lenders. The FDIC still allows its member banks to participate in payday lending, but it did issue guidelines in March 2005 that are meant to discourage long-term debt cycles by transitioning to a longer-term loan after six payday loan renewals.

To help ensure borrowers were not getting sucked into a debt trap, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a new, multipartay payroll loan regulation in 2017 that, among other things, required payroll lenders to double-check that borrowers could afford to pay back their loan on time by verifying information like incomes, rent, and even student loan payments. The new set of rules were to apply to a wide range of short-term credit products beyond just payroll loans, including auto title loans. To give companies time to adjust, the CFPB originally scheduled the rules to go into effect in August 2019. The Trump administration directed the agency to delay implementation, however, and first conduct another review.

In February 2019, the CFPB announced that it had finished its review and found the "ability to pay" requirements would restrict access to credit. Therefore, the new leadership

at the agency proposed abandoning these safeguards. The CFPB did keep in place restrictions that bar payday lenders from repeatedly trying to directly withdraw payments from a person's bank account. Some payday lenders attempt to recover their money by taking what they're owed directly from borrowers' checking accounts, which borrowers grant access to as a condition of the loan. But unexpected withdrawals from the lender can rack up pricey overdraft fees and damage credit scores. However, these restrictions won't take effect until at least November 2020.

Mortgages. Residential and commercial mortgages have become a major component in finance companies' asset portfolios, although they did not generally offer mortgages prior to 1979 (see Figure 14-5). Finance companies, which are not subject to as extensive a set of regulations as are banks, are often willing to issue mortgages to riskier borrowers than commercial banks. They compensate for the additional risk by charging higher interest rates. Mortgages include all loans secured by liens on any type of real estate (see Chapter 7). The mortgages in the loan portfolio can be first mortgages or second mortgages in the form of home equity loans. Home equity loans allow customers to borrow on a line of credit secured with a second mortgage on their home. Home equity loans have become very profitable for finance companies since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed, disallowing the tax deductibility of consumers' interest payments other than those made on home mortgages. Also, the bad debt expense and administrative costs of home equity loans are lower than on other finance company loans, and as a result they have become a very attractive product to finance companies.

Finance companies' mortgage portfolios also include securitized mortgage assets. Securitization of mortgages involves the pooling of a group of mortgages with similar characteristics, the removal of those mortgages from the balance sheet, and the subsequent sale of cash flows from the mortgage pool to secondary market investors in return for their purchase of bonds (mortgage-backed securities—see Chapters 7 and 25). Thus, securitization of mortgages results in the creation of mortgage-backed securities (e.g., government agency securities, collateralized mortgage obligations), which can be traded in secondary mortgage markets.

In addition to income from securitizing mortgage assets, finance companies earn income when they continue to service the original mortgages. Mortgage servicing is a fee-related business whereby, after mortgages are securitized, the flow of mortgage repayments (interest and principal) has to be collected and passed on (by the mortgage servicer) to investors in either whole mortgage loan packages or securitization vehicles such as pass-through securities (see Chapters 7 and 25). In undertaking this intermediation activity, the servicer charges a fee. As discussed below, in 2007-2008 a sharp rise in late payments and defaults by subprime and even relatively strong credit mortgage and home equity loan borrowers caused large losses for mortgage lenders and mortgage-backed securities investors and, ultimately, was the root cause of the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

Business Loans. Business loans represent 31.4 percent of the loan portfolio of finance companies. Finance companies have several advantages over commercial banks in offering loan services to small-business customers. First, they are not subject to regulations that restrict the type of products and services they can offer (discussed later). Second, because finance companies do not accept deposits, they have no bank-type regulators monitoring their behavior.[7] Third, being (in many cases) subsidiaries of corporate-sector holding companies, finance companies often have substantial industry and product expertise. Fourth—as mentioned with consumer loans—finance companies are more willing to accept risky customers than are commercial banks. Fifth, finance companies generally have lower overheads than banks (e.g., they do not need expensive tellers/ branches for deposit taking).

The major subcategories of business loans are retail and wholesale motor vehicle loans and leases (29.4 percent of all business loans in 2019), equipment loans (50.9 percent), and other business loans (19.7 percent). Motor vehicle loans consist of retail loans that assist in transactions between the retail seller of the good and the ultimate consumer (i.e., cars purchased by individuals and passenger car fleets purchased by a business for use by its employees). Wholesale loans are loan agreements between parties other than the companies' consumers. For example, Ford Motor Credit Company (FMCC) provides wholesale financing to Ford Motor Company dealers for inventory floor plans in which FMCC pays for Ford dealers' auto inventories received from Ford. FMCC puts a lien on each car on the showroom floor. While the dealer pays periodic interest on the floor plan loan, it is not until the car is sold that the dealer pays for the car.

Business-lending activities of finance companies also include equipment loans, with the finance company either owning or leasing the equipment directly to its industrial customer or providing the financial backing for a working capital loan or a loan to purchase or remodel the customer's facility. Finance companies often prefer to lease equipment rather than sell and finance the purchase of equipment. One reason for this is that repossession of the equipment in the event of default is less complicated when the finance company retains its title (by leasing). Further, a lease agreement generally requires no down payment, making a lease more attractive to the business customer. Finally, when the finance company retains ownership of the equipment (by leasing), it receives a tax deduction in the form of depreciation expense on the equipment. Other business loans include loans to businesses to finance or purchase accounts receivable at a discount (factoring), small farm loans, and wholesale loans and leases for mobile homes, campers, and trailers.

16. How subprime lender finance company customers differ from consumer loan customers at commercial banks?
17. What advantages finance companies offer over commercial banks to small-business customers?

Liabilities and Equity. As mentioned earlier, unlike commercial banks and thrifts, finance companies cannot accept deposits. Rather, to finance assets, finance companies rely primarily on bank loans, short-term commercial paper, and other debt instruments (longer-term notes and bonds). As data in Table 14-5 indicate, in 2019 bank loans amounted to  $153.6 billion (10.2 percent of total assets), commercial paper was$ 62.8 billion (4.2 percent), and other debt (due to parent holding companies and notes, bonds, and debentures) totaled $1,030.1 billion (68.5 percent). Debt due to parent includes all shortand long-term debt owed to the parent company of the finance company (e.g., debt Ford Motor Credit Corp. owes to Ford Motor Corp.). If the finance company subsidiary has a bad year and cannot make promised payments on its debt, the parent company is less likely than external fund providers to initiate legal proceedings against the finance company. However, given its large percentage funding, the parent to a finance company is susceptible to large losses of its own if the finance company subsidiary has a bad year. Total capital comprised $257.0 billion (17.1 percent of total assets). In comparison, commercial banks financed 78.0 percent of their assets with deposits, 10.7 with other liabilities, and 11.3 percent with equity.

# Industry Performance

In the early 2000s, the outlook for the finance company industry as a whole was quite bright. Interest rates remained near historical lows. Mortgage refinancing grew. Loan demand among lowerand middle-income consumers was strong. The largest finance companies—those that lend to less risky individual and business customers and with few subprime borrowers (e.g., HSBC Finance)—experienced strong profits and loan growth.

In the midand late 2000s, problems for industry participants that specialized in loans to relatively lower-quality customers created large losses in the industry and a problem for the U.S. economy as a whole. As home prices began to fall in 2005 through 2007 and borrowers faced rising interest rates, more people defaulted on their mortgages. At the end of 2006, the percentage of subprime mortgage loans on which payments were at least 60 days late was 14 percent, up from 6 percent in early 2005. With delinquencies and defaults by borrowers rising, finance companies experienced large losses. The results were sharply lower equity values for finance companies. For example, Countrywide Financial, the country's leading mortgage lender, lost over half its market value in the summer and fall of 2007 as it announced continued losses in its subprime mortgage portfolio. Only a 2 billion equity investment by Bank of America in 2007 and then an acquisition offer in 2008 kept this finance company alive. In March 2008, the FBI announced a probe of Countrywide for possible securities fraud. The inquiry involved whether company officials made misrepresentations about the company's financial position and the quality of its mortgage loans in securities filings.

This crash in the subprime mortgage market led to serious problems for the U.S. and worldwide economies as a whole. As noted earlier, the crisis resulted in the failure of Countrywide Financial and the forced conversion of GMAC Financial Services to a bank holding company in order to prevent its failure. Another notable failure was that of CIT Group, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2009. In 2008, CIT was a lender to nearly 1 million mostly small and midsized businesses. As the financial crisis hit, many of its borrowers became delinquent or defaulted on their loans. While CIT's failure would not have affected financial markets to the same extent as the failure of a large commercial bank such as Citigroup, it could have hurt the flow of credit to many businesses to which banks traditionally do not lend. As a result, in December 2008 the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group as a bank holding company, clearing a key hurdle for the firm to bolster its resources with loans and support from the government's financial rescue fund. However, as the financial crisis wore on, losses mounted and CIT was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. At the time of bankruptcy, CIT had assets of  $71 billion and liabilities of$ 65 billion. The bankruptcy eliminated $10 billion of this debt, including $2.3 billion extended to CIT in 2008 as part of the taxpayer bailout of the finance company. The bankruptcy of CIT Group was one of the largest filings ever of a U.S. company—trailing only the likes of Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, and General Motors.

As was true with depository institutions, as the U.S. economy improved in the late 2000s and early 2010s, the finance company industry improved as well. In the mid-2010s, industry median ROE rose to 9.33 percent, up from 6.61 percent during the height of the crisis. For business credit institutions ROE rose to 13.73 percent, up from 5.31 percent during the height of the crisis. Further, industry assets were  $1.82 trillion in the mid-2010s, up from$ 1.59 trillion during the crisis. However, in the late 2010s, industry assets have been declining back to the $1.4 trillion to $1.5 trillion range.

# Regulation

The Federal Reserve defines a finance company as a firm whose primary assets are loans to individuals and businesses. Finance companies, like depository institutions, are financial intermediaries that borrow funds so as to profit on the difference between the rates paid on borrowed funds and those charged on loans. Also like depository institutions, finance companies may be subject to state-imposed usury ceilings on the maximum loan rates assigned to individual customers and are regulated to the extent to which they can collect on delinquent loans (e.g., the legal mechanisms to be followed, such as Chapter 7 and 11 bankruptcy regulations). However, because finance companies do not accept deposits, they are not subject to extensive oversight by federal and state regulators, as are banks or thrifts—even though they offer services that compete directly with those of depository institutions (e.g., consumer installment loans and mortgages). The lack of regulatory oversight for these companies enables them to offer a wide scope of "bank-like" services and yet avoid the expense of regulatory compliance and the same "net regulatory burden" imposed on banks and thrifts (see Chapter 13).

However, because of the impact that nonbank FIs, including finance companies, had on the U.S. economy during the financial crisis and as a result of the need for the Federal Reserve to rescue several nonbank FIs, regulators proposed that nonbank FIs receive more oversight. At the height of the financial crisis the Fed stepped in to rescue numerous finance companies, including GMAC (now Ally Financial), GE Capital, and CIT Group. Additionally, credit lenders American Express and Discover Financial (as well as investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) were granted charters to become bank holding companies in 2008. For example, GE Capital's exposure to the 2008-2009 financial crisis resulted in General Electric Corp.'s market value falling by more than half during 2008 (GE Capital accounted for about half of GE's sales and profit). To reassure investors and help GE Capital compete with banks that already had government protection behind their debt, on November 12, 2008, the FDIC approved GE Capital's application for designation as an eligible entity under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). Granting this finance company access to the FDIC program was possible because GE Capital also owns a federal savings bank and an industrial loan company, both of which qualified for FDIC assistance. The terms of these agreements included, among other things, a requirement that GE and GE Capital reimburse the FDIC for any amounts paid by the FDIC to holders of debt guaranteed by the FDIC. December 24, 2008, was a key turning point in GMAC's history when it was approved as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act. GMAC had been hit with huge losses in both its mortgage and auto loan businesses during the financial crisis. Its mortgage unit, Residential Capital, had suffered significant losses on home loans it made during the housing boom of the early and mid-2000s. The company lost 8 billion in 2007-2008. In light of the impact that GMAC's losses were having on the financial markets, and to help ensure the survival of the company, federal regulators permitted the financing arm of General Motors (renamed Ally Financial) to become a bank holding company.

As a result, as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the federal government was provided with the tools it needed to manage financial crises by establishing (1) a new regime to resolve nonbank financial institutions whose failure could have serious systemic effects and (2) revisions to the Federal Reserve's emergency lending authority to improve accountability. The act also proposed robust supervision and regulation of all financial firms by establishing (1) a new Financial Services Oversight Council of financial regulators (chaired by the Treasury and including the heads of the principal federal financial regulators as members) to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; (2) a new authority for the Federal Reserve to supervise all firms that could pose a threat to financial stability, even those that do not own banks; and (3) stronger capital and other prudential standards for all financial firms and even higher standards for large, interconnected firms.

By the mid-2010s, some of these companies realized the burden of increased regulation was extensive and took steps to get out from under them. For example, to escape stricter regulations, in June 2016 GE Capital signed agreements for the sale of about  $180 billion of businesses and closed about$ 156 billion of those transactions. The company had $500 billion in assets at the end of 2014. The goal was to sell around $260 billion in total assets by the end of 2017. Because GE Capital had shrunk and restructured the business, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council removed GE Capital's designation as a "systemically important" financial institution, a label that had

required the company to submit to stricter rules and supervision by the Federal Reserve. GE's case marked the first time the oversight council has removed a "systemically important" designation since the tag was created under the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Since finance companies are heavy borrowers in the capital markets and do not enjoy the same regulatory "safety net" as banks, they need to signal their safety and solvency to investors. Such signals are usually sent by holding much higher equity or capital-to-assets ratios—and therefore, lower leverage ratios—than banks. For example, the 2019 aggregate balance sheet for finance companies (Table 14-5) shows a capital-to-assets ratio of 17.1 percent. This compares to the capital-to-assets ratio of 11.3 percent for commercial banks. Larger captive finance companies also use default protection guarantees from their parent companies and/or other guarantees, such as letters of credit or lines of credit purchased for a fee from high-quality commercial or investment banks, as additional protection against insolvency risk and as a device to increase their ability to raise additional funds in the capital and money markets. Thus, this group will tend to operate with lower capital-to-assets ratios than smaller finance companies. Given that regulatory oversight of this industry is relatively light, having sufficient capital and access to financial guarantees are critical to their continued ability to raise funds. Thus, finance companies operate more like nonfinancial, nonregulated companies than the other types of financial institutions examined in this text.

In contrast to savings institutions in the United States, which must have at least 65 percent of their assets in the form of mortgages (or they lose their charter), savings institutions and cooperative banks (similar to credit unions in the U.S.) in Europe were created in the 19th century to channel individuals' savings into the continent's commercial industry. Savings institutions also served as an instrument for providing basic banking services to the poor. The majority of savings institutions in Europe are mutuals (owned by local officials, religious organizations, unions, and deposit holders) rather than stock-owned depository institutions. In the late 2000s, deregulation, liberalization, and privatization changed the role of these FIs. These institutions were regarded as old-fashioned, outdated, and inefficient. In some European countries, savings banks and cooperative banks completely disappeared as specific groups of financial institutions; in others, they changed so much that it was difficult to distinguish between these institutions and commercial banks. However, the problems in and the failures of commercial banks during the financial crisis changed the way that savings and cooperative banks were viewed. Indeed, many policymakers and regulators adopted policy initiatives to try to make all banks behave a bit more like the savings banks and cooperative banks.

There are two features that all savings banks in Europe have in common: (1) their focus on savings and savings mobilization and (2) their clear regional and even local focus. Cooperative banks are regional banks. They adhere to the regional principle; they are parts of dense networks that foster within-group cooperation, and they also have a dual objective. Savings banks play the dominant important role in some countries such as Spain and Germany, while cooperative banks dominate in others such as France. In some countries, both banking groups play an important role (e.g., in Austria and in Germany). In other countries, one of the two banking groups clearly dominates the other one.

While commercial banks are the most important source of credit supply in many foreign countries, particularly emerging market economies, nonbank financial institutions (finance companies, credit unions, and building societies) not only account for a substantial part of the outstanding credit by all financial institutions, but their relative importance has been increasing over the past decade. Specialized consumer finance agencies operate throughout western Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, and some Latin American countries. For example, from 1994 to the 2010s, the percentage of aggregate credit issued by nonbank financial institutions increased from 22 percent to 35 percent in Latin America and from 4 percent to 15 percent in central Europe. In Thailand, nonbank financial institutions, particularly those specializing in credit card lending, gained market share. This trend also occurred in Mexico, where specialized mortgage institutions now dominate low-income mortgage lending. Large sales finance companies specialize in financing purchases of particular commodities and remain closely associated with specific manufacturers. Some also extend credit for wholesale purchases by retail dealers.

While the financial crisis affected the operations of finance companies, they still remained a major part of the financial sector in countries worldwide. For example, in New Zealand the financial crisis led to the consolidation, collapse, and restructuring of many of the country's finance companies. Further, in Russia significant finance company staff reductions occurred during the financial crisis. Because regulations in most foreign countries are not as restrictive as those in the United States, finance companies in foreign countries are generally subsidiaries of commercial banks or industrial firms. For those finance companies owned by commercial banks, as the bank goes, so does the finance company.

# SUMMARY

This chapter provided an overview of the major activities of savings institutions, credit unions, and finance companies. Savings institutions and credit unions rely heavily on deposits to fund loans, whereas finance companies do not accept deposits but fund themselves mainly with commercial paper and long-term security issues. Historically, while commercial banks have concentrated on commercial or business lending and on investing in securities, savings institutions have concentrated on mortgage lending and credit unions on consumer lending. Finance companies also compete directly with depository institutions for high-quality (prime) loan customers. Further, this industry services those subprime (high-risk) borrowers deemed too risky for depository institutions. These differences are being eroded due to competitive forces, regulation, and the changing nature of financial and business technology, so that the types of interest rate, credit, liquidity, and operational risks faced by commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and finance companies are becoming increasingly similar.
