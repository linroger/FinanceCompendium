# SERVICES OFFERED BY SECURITIES FIRMS VERSUS INVESTMENT BANKS: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Securities firms and investment banks primarily help net suppliers of funds (e.g., households) transfer funds to net users of funds (e.g., businesses) at a low cost and with a maximum degree of efficiency. Unlike other types of FIs, securities firms and investment banks do not transform the securities issued by the net users of funds into claims that may be "more" attractive to the net suppliers of funds (e.g., banks and their creation of bank deposits). Rather, they serve as brokers intermediating between fund suppliers and users.

Investment banking involves transactions such as the raising of debt and equity securities for corporations or governments. This includes the origination, underwriting, and placement of securities in money and capital markets for corporate or government issuers. Securities services involve assistance in the trading of securities in the secondary markets (brokerage services or market making). Together these services are performed by securities firms and investment banks. The largest companies in this industry perform multiple services (e.g., underwriting and brokerage services). These full-line firms are generally called investment banks. Many other firms concentrate their services in one area only (either securities trading or securities underwriting). That is, some firms in the industry specialize in the purchase, sale, and brokerage of existing securities (the retail side of the business) and are called securities firms, while other firms specialize in originating, underwriting, and distributing issues of new securities (the commercial side of the business) and are called investment banks. Both segments have undergone substantial structural changes in recent years. Some of the notable consolidations include the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. Indeed, as discussed later in the chapter, the investment

Investment banking also includes corporate finance activities such as advising on mergers and acquisitions (M&As), as well as advising on the restructuring of existing corporations. Figure 16-1 reports M&As managed by investment banks for the period 1990-2019. Total dollar volume (measured by completed merger transaction value) of domestic M&As increased from less than 200 billion in 1990 to 1.83 trillion in 2000. This merger wave was not restricted to the United States. For example, in 2000 there were over 36,700 merger and acquisition deals globally, valued at over $3.49 trillion. Nevertheless, reflecting the downturn in the U.S. economy, M&A transactions fell 53 percent in 2001 to $819 billion on only 7,525 deals (the first time since 1995 there were fewer than 10,000 deals). Similarly, worldwide M&As fell to 1.74 trillion in 2001. Domestic M&A activity bottomed out at  $458 billion in 2002 (while worldwide activity fell to$ 1.20 trillion) before recovering (along with the economy), topping $1.71 trillion in the United States (and $4.5 trillion worldwide) in 2007. During the financial crisis, domestic M&A activity fell to  $903 billion,$ 713 billion, and $687 billion in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively, while worldwide M&As fell to  $2.9 trillion,$ 1.7 trillion, and $1.8 trillion, respectively. Note that while this period included the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, M&A activity remained at higher levels than those experienced in the early 2000s. As the U.S. economy recovered, M&A activity increased starting from 2014, reaching pre-crisis levels in 2018.

This chapter presents an overview of (1) the size, structure, and composition of the industry; (2) the key activities of securities firms and investment banks; (3) the industry's balance sheet and recent trends; and (4) its regulation.

# SIZE, STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITION OF THE INDUSTRY

Because of the emphasis on securities trading and underwriting rather than longer-term investment in securities, the size of the industry is usually measured by the equity capital of the firms participating in the industry rather than by "asset size." Securities trading and underwriting is a financial service that requires relatively little investment in assets or liability funding (such as the issuance of loans funded through deposits or payments on insurance contracts funded through insurance premiums). Rather, securities trading and underwriting is a profit- (equity-) generating activity that does not require that FIs actually hold or invest in the securities they trade or issue for their customers. Accordingly, asset value is not traditionally the main measure of the size of a firm in this industry. According to Securities Industry Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), equity capital in the industry amounted to  $263.2 billion in 2018, supporting total assets of$ 4.32 trillion.

Beginning in 1980 and until the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, the number of firms in the industry expanded dramatically, from 5,248 in 1980 to 9,515 in 1987. The aftermath of the crash included a major shakeout, with the number of firms declining to 5,052 by 2006 similar to the commercial banking industry, concentration of business among the largest firms over this period increased dramatically through M&As among the top-ranked firms in the industry. Table 16-1 lists major U.S. securities industry M&A transactions, many of which involve repeated ownership changes. Notice from this table that many M&As are interindustry mergers among financial service firms (e.g., insurance companies and investment banks). Recent regulatory changes such as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (discussed briefly here and in detail in Chapter 13) have been the major cause of such mergers. In fact, note in Table 16-1 that a majority of the securities industry mergers and acquisitions occurring in the 2000s include securities firms that are part of a financial services holding company.

The financial crisis resulted in a second major change in the structure of the industry. The five largest investment banks in existence at the beginning of 2008 (Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) were all gone as investment banks by the end of the year. Lehman Brothers failed at the start of the financial crisis, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were acquired by financial services holding companies (JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, respectively), and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley requested and were granted commercial bank charters. As at least a partial result of the four investment banks being purchased by or converting to a commercial bank, in 2018 commercial bank holding companies' fee income from investment banking, advisory, securities brokerage, and underwriting topped  $12.52 billion. This is up from 2012 when fee income was$ 9.15 billion, but down from pre-financial crisis levels of 14.10 billion. Table 16-2 lists some of the top bank holding companies in terms of investment banking, advisory, brokerage, and underwriting fee income. Further, the number of securities firms continued to fall to 3,788 by 2018. The investment banking industry was irrevocably changed.

In its changed state, the firms in the industry can be divided along a number of dimensions. First are the largest firms, the diversified financial service or national full-service investment banks that service both retail customers (especially by acting

as broker-dealers—assisting in the trading of existing securities, or secondary market transactions) and corporate customers (by securities underwriting—assisting in the issue of new securities, or primary market transactions).

With the changes in the past few years, national full-service firms now fall into three subgroups. First are the commercial bank or financial services holding companies that are the largest of the full-service investment banks. They have extensive domestic and international operations and offer advice, underwriting, brokerage, trading, and asset management services. The largest of these firms include Bank of America (through its acquisition of Merrill Lynch), Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan (through its many acquisitions, including that of Bear Stearns, for 236 million in 2008). Second are the national full-service firms

that specialize more in corporate finance or primary market activities and are highly active in trading securities, or secondary market activities. A good example of this is Goldman Sachs. Third are the large investment banks. These firms maintain more limited branch networks concentrated in major cities operating with predominantly institutional client bases. These firms include Lazard Ltd. and Greenhill & Co.

The rest of the industry is comprised of firms that perform a mix of primary and secondary market services for a particular segment of the financial markets:

1. Regional securities firms, which are often classified as large, medium, and small and concentrate on servicing customers in a particular region, such as New York or California (e.g., Raymond James Financial).
2. Specialized discount brokers (such as Charles Schwab), which effect trades for customers without offering investment advice or tips.
3. Specialized electronic trading securities firms (such as E*Trade), which provide a platform for customers to trade without the use of a broker. Rather, trades are enacted on a computer via the Internet. The number of people living in U.S. households that used an online investing/stock trading service increased from 11.63 million in 2008 to 14.01 million in 2015. New features, such as the ability to trade from mobile phones and tablets, and the increased speed with which trades can be made are some of the main reasons for the increase.
4. Venture capital and private equity firms, which pool money from individual investors and other FIs (e.g., insurance companies) to fund relatively small and new businesses (e.g., biotechnology).
5. Other firms in this industry include research boutiques, companies with large clearing operations, and other firms that do not fit into one of the categories above. This would include firms such as GTS, Virtu Financial, and Citadel Securities (also known as designated market makers).

# SECURITIES FIRM AND INVESTMENT BANK ACTIVITY AREAS

LG 16-2

Securities firms and investment banks engage in as many as eight key activity areas: investment banking, venture capital, market making, trading, investing, cash management, mergers and acquisitions, and other service functions. As we describe each of these below, note that while each activity is available to a firm's customers independently, many of the activities can be and are conducted simultaneously (such as mergers and acquisitions, issuing debt and equity, and advisory services) for a firm's customers.

# Investment Banking

Investment banking refers to activities related to underwriting and distributing new issues of debt and equity securities. New issues can be either first-time issues of a company's debt or equity securities or the new issues of a firm whose debt or equity is already trading—secondary security offerings or seasoned issues (see Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion). As discussed in Chapter 8, an investment bank will often bring in a number of other investment banks (a so-called syndicate) to help sell and distribute a new issue. In 2019, a total of  $10.86 trillion of debt and equity was underwritten globally. This was up from$ 4.95 trillion underwritten in 2008 during the financial crisis, also well above the pre-crisis amounts of  $7.51 and$ 7.84 trillion in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the $10.86 trillion amount, $0.68 trillion were global equity proceeds. Table 16-3 lists the top five underwriters of debt and equity for 2019 based on the dollar value of issues underwritten. The top five underwriters represented 57.7 percent of global debt issues and 38.5 percent of global equity issues, suggesting that the industry is dominated by a small number of "top tier" underwriting firms. Top tier rating and the implied reputation this brings has a huge effect

# private placement

A securities issue placed with one or a few large institutional investors.

in this business. At times, investment banks have refused to participate in an issue because their name would not be placed where they desired it on the "tombstone" advertisement announcing an issue (see Chapter 8).

Securities underwriting can be undertaken through either public or private offerings. A public offering represents the sale of a security to the public at large. In a private offering, an investment bank acts as a private placement agent for a fee, placing the securities with one or a few large institutional investors such as life insurance companies. Issuers of privately placed securities are not required to register with the SEC since the placements (sales of securities) are made only to large, sophisticated investors. In a public offering, the securities may be underwritten on a best efforts or a firm commitment basis, and the securities may be offered to the public at large. With best efforts underwriting, investment bankers act as agents on a fee basis related to their success in placing the issue with investors. In firm commitment underwriting, the investment bank acts as a principal, purchasing the securities from the issuer at one price and seeking to place them with public investors at a slightly higher price. Factors causing preference for a best efforts versus a firm commitment offering to the issuing firm include general volatility in the market, stability and maturity of the financial health of the issuing firm, and the perceived appetite for new issues in the market place. The investment bank will also consider these factors when negotiating the fees and/or pricing spread in making its decision regarding the offering process. Finally, in addition to investment banking operations in the corporate securities markets, the investment bank may participate as an underwriter (primary dealer) in government, municipal, and mortgage-backed securities. See Chapters 6, 7, and 8 for a detailed discussion of these services. Table 16-4 shows the top ranked underwriters for 2018 and 2019 in the different areas of securities underwriting.

# EXAMPLE 16-1 Best Efforts versus Firm Commitment Securities Offering

An investment bank agrees to underwrite an issue of 20,000,000 shares of stock for Murray Construction Corp. on a firm commitment basis. The investment bank pays  $15.50 per share to Murray Construction Corp. for the 20,000,000 shares of stock. It then sells those shares to the public for$ 16.35 per share. How much money does Murray Construction Corp. receive? What is the profit to the investment bank? If the investment bank can only sell the shares for 14.75, how much money does Murray Construction Corp. receive? What is the profit to the investment bank?

If the investment bank sells the stock for  $16.35 per share, Murray Construction Corp. receives$ 15.50 × 20,000,000 shares = $310,000,000. The profit to the investment bank is ($16.35 - $15.50) × 20,000,000 shares = $17,000,000. The stock price of Murray Construction Corp. is $16.35, since that is what the public agrees to pay. From the perspective of Murray Construction Corp., the $17,000,000 represents the commission that it must pay to issue the stock.

If the investment bank sells the stock for  $14.75 per share, Murray Construction Corp. still receives$ 15.50 × 20,000,000 shares = $310,000,000. The profit to the investment bank is ($14.75 - $15.50) × 20,000,000 shares = -$15,000,000. The stock price of Murray Construction Corp. is $14.75, since that is what the public agrees to pay. From the perspective of the investment bank, the -$15,000,000 represents a loss for the firm commitment it made to Murray Construction Corp. to issue the stock.

Suppose instead the investment bank agrees to underwrite these 20,000,000 shares on a best efforts basis. The investment bank is able to sell 18,400,000 shares for  $15.50 per share, and it charges Murray Construction Corp.$ 0.375 per share sold. How much money does Murray Construction Corp. receive? What is the profit to the investment bank? If the investment bank can only sell the shares for 14.75, how much money does Murray Construction Corp. receive? What is the profit to the investment bank?

If the investment bank sells the stock for $15.50 per share, Murray Construction Corp. receives ($15.50 - $0.375) × 18,400,000 shares = $278,300,000, the investment bank's profit is $0.375 × 18,400,000 shares = $6,900,000, and the stock price is 15.50 per share, since that is what the public pays.

If the investment bank sells the stock for $14.75 per share, Murray Construction Corp. receives ($14.75 - $0.375) × 18,400,000 shares = $264,500,000, the investment bank's profit is still $0.375 × 18,400,000 shares = $6,900,000, and the stock price is 14.75 per share, since that is what the public pays.

# Venture Capital

A difficulty for new and small firms in obtaining debt financing from commercial banks is that CBs are generally not willing or able to make loans to new companies with no assets and business history. In this case, new and small firms often turn to investment banks (and other firms) that make venture capital investments to get capital financing as well as advice. Venture capital is a professionally managed pool of money used to finance new and often high-risk firms. Venture capital is generally provided to back an untried company and its managers in return for an equity investment in the firm. Venture capital firms do not make outright loans. Rather, they purchase an equity interest in the firm that gives them the same rights and privileges associated with an equity investment made by the firm's other owners. As equity holders, venture capital firms are not generally passive investors. They provide valuable expertise to the firm's managers and sometimes even help in recruiting senior

managers for the firm. They also generally expect to be fully informed about the firm's operations, any problems, and whether the joint goals of all the firm's owners are being met.

The terms venture capital and private equity are often used interchangeably. However, there are distinct differences in the two types of investment institutions. For example, venture capital firms, generally using the pooled investment resources of institutions and wealthy individuals, concern themselves more with startup business concerns, while private equity firms acquire the investment funds they use from sources such as equity securities and nonpublicly traded stocks as well as the institutional and individual investment pooling used by venture capital firms. Further, venture capital firms tend to utilize teams of either scientific or business professionals to help identify new and emerging technologies in which to place their money. Private equity firms deal more with existing companies that have already proven themselves in the business field. As a result of the financial crisis, the differences between venture capital firms and private equity firms have become less distinct. With fewer new ventures being brought forth, there has been greater competition between the two types of investment institutions, with both searching for and funding the same types of new and small firms.

There are many types of venture capital firms. Institutional venture capital firms are business entities whose sole purpose is to find and fund the most promising new firms. Private-sector institutional venture capital firms include limited partner venture capital firms (that are established by professional venture capital firms, acting as general partners in the firm: organizing and managing the firm and eventually liquidating their equity investment), financial venture capital firms (subsidiaries of investment or commercial banks), and corporate venture capital firms (subsidiaries of nonfinancial corporations which generally specialize in making start-up investments in high-tech firms). Limited partner venture capital firms dominate the industry. In addition to these private-sector institutional venture capital firms, the federal government, through the SBA, operates Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). SBICs are privately organized venture capital firms licensed by the SBA that make equity investments (as well as loans) to entrepreneurs for start-up activities and expansions. As federally sponsored entities, SBICs have relied on their unique opportunity to obtain investment funds from the U.S. Treasury at very low rates relative to private-sector institutional venture capital firms. In contrast to institutional venture capital firms, angel venture capitalists (angels) are wealthy individuals who make equity investments. Angel venture capitalists have invested much more in new and small firms than institutional venture capital firms.

Venture capital firms receive many unsolicited proposals of funding from new and small firms. A majority of these requests are rejected. Venture capital firms look for two things in making their decisions to invest in a firm. The first is a high return. Venture capital firms are willing to invest in high-risk new and small firms. However, they require high levels of returns (sometimes as high as 700 percent within five to seven years) to take on these risks. The second is an easy exit. Venture capital firms realize a profit on their investments by eventually selling their interests in the firm. They want a quick and easy exit opportunity when it comes time to sell. Basically, venture capital firms provide equity funds to new, unproven, and young firms. This separates venture capital firms from commercial banks, which prefer to invest in existing, financially secure businesses.

Although venture capital business boomed in the 1990s and 2000s, this area took a hit after the financial crisis. The Volcker Rule, part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, restricts banks from making big bets with their own money and thus has sharply reduced banks' investments in their own funds. As a result of the rule, Goldman Sachs had to shrink the size of its own investment in its funds to just 3 percent from as much as 37 percent. Bank of America decided to exit the private equity business altogether and Citigroup explored several options for its private equity funds after reducing its investments in hedge funds. For years, investment banks have attracted clients to invest in their venture capital funds by risking their own funds as well as the funds of their partners. However, this changed when the Volcker Rule was implemented in July 2014. As a result, investors have become more cautious about putting their money into venture capital funds.

# Market Making

Market making involves the creation of a secondary market in an asset by a securities firm or investment bank. Thus, in addition to being primary dealers in government securities and underwriters of corporate bonds and equities, investment banks make a secondary market in these instruments. Market making can involve either agency or principal transactions. Agency transactions are two-way transactions made on behalf of customers—for example, acting as a stockbroker or dealer for a fee or commission (as discussed in Chapter 8). On the NYSE, a market maker in a stock such as IBM may, upon the placement of orders by its customers, buy the stock at  $185 from one customer and immediately resell it at$ 186 to another customer. The $1 difference between the buy and sell price is usually called the bid-ask spread and represents a large proportion of the market maker's profit. In principal transactions, the market maker seeks to profit on the price movements of securities and takes either long or short inventory positions for its own account. (Or the market maker may take an inventory position to stabilize the market in the securities.) In the previous example, the market maker would buy the IBM stock at $185 and hold it in its own portfolio in expectation of a price increase. Normally, market making can be a fairly profitable business. However, in periods of market stress or high volatility, these profits can rapidly disappear. For example, on the NYSE, in return for having monopoly power in market making for individual stocks (e.g., IBM), market makers have an "affirmative obligation" to buy stocks from sellers even when the market is crashing. This caused a number of actual and near bankruptcies for NYSE market makers at the time of the financial crisis. Finally, competition from Internet-based exchanges such as Instinet and Direct Edge has cut into trader's profits (Direct Edge merged with BATS Global Markets in 2014, and BATS got acquired by CBOE in 2017).

When NYSE merged with electronic exchange Arca in 2006 and adopted a hybrid model for the floor, prices were no longer set by open outcry and many of the once-powerful market-making specialists were forced to consolidate or shut down. That has left only five designated market makers (DMMs) remaining on the NYSE: Brendan E. Cryan, Citadel Securities, GTS Securities, IMC Financial Markets and Virtu Americas. A DMM has an obligation to maintain orderly markets, provide quotes on stocks at the "national best bid and offer" and facilitate trading at potentially illiquid moments of the trading day, such as the open and close. It can also match the market's best price in exchange for constantly quoting bids and asks. According to NYSE, DMMs accounted for about 17 percent of liquidity adding volume in NYSE-listed securities in 2019.

# Trading

Trading is closely related to the market-making activities performed by securities firms and investment banks just described; a trader takes an active net position in an underlying instrument or asset. There are at least six types of trading activities:

1. Position Trading—involves purchases of large blocks of securities on the expectation of a favorable price move. Position traders maintain long or short positions for intervals of up to several weeks or even months. Rather than attempting to profit from very short-term movements in prices, as day traders do, position traders take relatively longer views of market trends. Such positions also facilitate the smooth functioning of the secondary markets in such securities.
2. Pure Arbitrage—entails buying an asset in one market at one price and selling it immediately in another market at a higher price. Pure arbitrageurs often attempt to profit from price discrepancies that may exist between the spot, or cash, price of a security and its corresponding futures price. Some important theoretical pricing relationships in futures markets should exist with spot markets and prices (see Chapter 10). When these relationships get out of line, pure arbitrageurs enter the market to exploit them.
3. Risk Arbitrage—involves buying securities in anticipation of some information release—such as a merger or takeover announcement or a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. It is termed risk arbitrage because if the event does not actually occur—for example, if a merger does not take place or the Federal Reserve does not change interest rates—the trader stands to lose money.
4. Program Trading—is defined by the NYSE as the simultaneous buying and selling of a portfolio of at least 15 different stocks valued at more than 1 million, using computer programs to initiate such trades. Program trading is a type of pure arbitrage trading in that it is often associated with seeking to profit from differences between the cash market price (e.g., the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Market Index) and the futures market price of a particular instrument. Because computers are used to continuously monitor stock and futures prices—and can even initiate buy or sell orders—these trades are classified separately as program trading.
5. Stock Brokerage—involves the trading of securities on behalf of individuals who want to transact in the money or capital markets. To conduct such transactions, individuals contact their broker (such as Merrill Lynch), who then sends the orders to its representative at the exchange to conduct the trades (see Chapter 8). Large brokerage firms often have several licenses on the floor of a stock exchange (e.g., NYSE), through which their commission brokers (see Chapter 8) trade orders from the firm's clients or for the firm's own account.
6. Electronic Brokerage—offered by major brokers, involves direct access, via the Internet, to the trading floor, therefore bypassing traditional brokers. Many securities firms and investment banks offer online trading services to their customers as well as direct access to a client representative (stockbroker). Thus, customers may now conduct trading activities from their homes and offices through their accounts at securities firms. Because services provided by a typical brokerage firm are bypassed, the cost per share is generally lower and the price may be advantageous compared with trading directly on the exchanges. Users of the system can often use the network to discover existing sizes and quotes of offers to buy or sell. Interested parties can then negotiate with each other using the system's computers.

Securities trading can be conducted on behalf of a customer as an agent or on behalf of the firm as a principal. When trading at the retail level occurs on behalf of customers, it is often called brokerage (or stock brokering).

# Investing

Investing involves managing pools of assets such as closedand open-end mutual funds (in competition with commercial banks, life insurance companies, and pension funds). Securities firms can manage such funds either as agents for other investors or as principals for themselves and their stockholders. As we discuss in more detail in Chapter 17, the objective in funds management is to select asset portfolios to beat some return-risk performance benchmark such as the S&P 500 Index. Since this business generates fees that are based on the size of the pool of assets managed, it tends to produce a more stable flow of income than does either investment banking or trading (discussed earlier).

# Cash Management

Securities firms and investment banks offer bank deposit-like cash management accounts (CMAs) to individual investors and, since the 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act (see Chapter 13), deposit accounts themselves (Merrill Lynch being the first to offer a direct deposit account in June 2000 via the two banks it owns). Most of these accounts allow customers to write checks against some type of mutual fund account (e.g., money market mutual fund). These accounts can even be covered directly or indirectly by federal deposit insurance from the FDIC. CMAs were adopted by other security firms under various names (e.g., house account) and spread rapidly. Many of these accounts offer ATM services and debit cards. As a result of CMAs, the distinction between commercial banks and investment banks became blurred. However, the advantage of brokerage firm CMAs over commercial bank deposit accounts is that they make it easier to buy and

# cash management accounts (CMAs)

sell securities. The broker can take funds out of the CMA account when an investor buys a security and deposit funds back into the CMA when the investor sells securities. In 2013 regulators proposed new rules that would significantly diminish these accounts as close substitutes to commercial bank deposit accounts. Under the new rules, the net asset values (NAVs) of money market mutual fund (MMMF) shares would float as the value of the underlying investments change. (As discussed in Chapter 17, NAVs of MMMFs are currently set at 1 per share.) Floating NAVs for MMMF shares would transform cash management accounts into floating value accounts. These new regulations would significantly reduce the advantages of CMAs. CMAs were instrumental in this industry's efforts to provide commercial banking services prior to the passage of the 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act. Since the passage of this regulation, securities firms are allowed to make loans, offer credit and debit cards, provide ATM services, and, most important, sell securities.

# Mergers and Acquisitions

As noted earlier, investment banks frequently provide advice on, and assistance in, mergers and acquisitions. For example, they assist in finding merger partners, underwrite any new securities to be issued by the merged firms, assess the value of target firms, recommend terms of the merger agreement, and even assist target firms in preventing a merger (e.g., writing restrictive provisions into a potential target firm's securities contracts). As mentioned in the chapter overview, mergers and acquisitions activity stood at 1.82 trillion in 2019. Panel A of Table 16-5 lists the top 10 investment banks ranked by dollar volume of the U.S. mergers in which they were involved. Panel B of Table 16-5 lists the top 10

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

5. What the key areas of activities for securities firms are?
6. What the difference is between a best efforts and a firm commitment offering?
7. What the six trading activities performed by securities firms are?

Other service functions include custody and escrow services, clearance and settlement services, and research and advisory services—for example, giving advice on divestitures, spin-offs, and asset sales. In addition, investment banks are making increasing inroads into traditional bank service areas such as small-business lending and the trading of loans (see Chapters 7 and 25). In performing these functions, investment banks normally act as agents for a fee. Fees charged are often based on the total bundle of services performed for the client by the firm. The portion of the fee or commission allocated to research and advisory services is called soft dollars. When one area in the firm, such as an investment advisor, uses client commissions to buy research from another area in the firm, it receives a benefit because it is relieved from the need to produce and pay for the research itself. Thus, advisors using soft dollars face a conflict of interest between their need to obtain research and their clients' interest in paying the lowest commission rate available. Because of the conflict of interest that exists, the SEC (the primary regulator of investment banks and securities firms, see below) requires these firms to disclose soft dollar arrangements to their clients.

# RECENT TRENDS AND BALANCE SHEETS

# Recent Trends

In this section, we look at the balance sheet and trends in the securities firm and investment banking industry since the 1987 stock market crash. Trends in this industry depend heavily on the state of the stock market. For example, a major effect of the 1987 stock market crash was a sharp decline in stock market trading volume and, thus, in the brokerage commissions earned by securities firms over the 1987-1991 period. Commission income began to recover only in and after 1992 with record stock market trading volumes being achieved in 1992 through 2000 (when the Dow Jones and S&P indexes hit new highs—see Chapter 8). Improvements in the U.S. economy in the mid-2000s resulted in an even greater increase in stock market values and trading and thus commission income. However, rising oil prices and the subprime mortgage market collapse and the eventual full market crash in 2008 through 2009 pushed stock market values down. As a result, commission income in the securities industry declined as well. As the economy and the stock market recovered in the early and mid-2010s, commission income again rose to before it started declining again in late 2010s.

As seen in Figure 16-2, noninterest income makes up a significant portion of most banks' revenue. In addition to service fees (e.g., ATM fees, overdraft fees, etc.) and loan origination fees, other forms of noninterest income come from nontraditional bank activities, such as brokering securities, arranging M&As for firms, and trading stocks and bonds. As of the fourth quarter of 2019, noninterest income was 32.6 percent of total bank operating revenue (defined as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income), or  $66 billion out of$ 203 billion. Before the financial crisis, the ratio of noninterest income to operating revenue was even higher, averaging around 41.2 percent from 2001 to 2007. The ratio is now about 10 percent lower than before the crisis. In absolute terms, noninterest income actually rose between 2001 and 2019, but operating revenue rose even faster. Over this period, noninterest income increased by 53 percent, but operating revenue increased by 96 percent. Investment banking, advisory, brokerage and underwriting fees and commissions are part of noninterest income and have been declining as a percent of operating revenue as well (see Figure 16-2).

Also affecting the profitability of the investment banking industry was the decline in bond and equity underwriting during the 1987-1990 period. This was partly a result of the stock market crash, partly a result of a decline in M&As, and partly a reflection of investor concerns about junk bonds (which crashed during this period). Between 1991 and 2001, however, the securities industry showed a resurgence in underwriting activity and profitability. For example, domestic underwriting activity over the 1990-2001 period grew from  $192.7 billion in 1990 to$ 1,623.9 billion in 2001 (see Table 16-6). The principal reasons for this were enhanced trading profits and increased growth in new issue underwritings. In particular, corporate debt issues became highly attractive to corporate treasurers because of relatively low long-term interest rates. Further, debt is less risky than equity, so there is less risk of an adverse price movement with debt compared to equity. Finally, debt is more likely to be bought in larger blocks by fewer investors, a transaction characteristic that makes the selling process less costly. In addition to debt securities, growth in the asset-backed securities market as a result of increased securitization of mortgages (and growth of mortgage debt) added to the value of underwriting.

As a result of enhanced trading profits and growth in new issues underwriting, pretax profits for the industry topped  $9 billion in every year over the period 1996-2000. This is despite the collapse of Russian ruble and bond markets in 1998, economic turmoil in Asia in 1997, and economic uncertainty in the United States in the early 2000s. Indeed, despite a downturn in the U.S. economy toward the end of 2000, pretax profits in the securities industry soared to an all-time high of$ 31.6 billion in 2000. Only the continued slowdown of the U.S. economy in 2001, an accompanying drop in stock market values, and terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (which housed the offices of many securities firms and investment banks) in September 2001 brought an end to record profits. While still strong by historical standards, industry pretax profits for 2001 fell 24 percent, to $16.0 billion. The Bank of New York alone estimated its costs associated with the terrorist attacks at $125 million. Citigroup estimated it lost $100 million to $200 million in business from branches that were closed and because of the four days the stock market did not trade.

Morgan Stanley, the largest commercial tenant in the World Trade Center, said the cost of property damage and relocation of its employees was 150 million. Also impacting profit, the securities industry was rocked by several allegations of securities law violations as well as a loss of investor confidence in Wall Street and corporate America as a result of a number of corporate governance failures and accounting scandals including Enron, Merck, WorldCom, and other major U.S. corporations.

With the recovery of the U.S. economy in the mid-2000s, the U.S. securities industry again earned record profits as revenue growth strengthened and became more broadly based. Domestic underwriting surged to  $3,338.3 billion in 2006, from$ 1,623.9 billion in 2001 (see Table 16-6). Further, the industry maintained its profitability mainly through deep cuts in expenses. Total expenses fell 10.4 percent from 2002 levels, largely due to lower interest expenses. Interest expense fell from  $48.4 billion in 2002 to$ 37.5 billion in 2003, rising to $44.2 billion in 2004. The result was an increase in pretax profits to $24.1 billion in 2003 and $20.7 billion in 2004 (see Figure 16-3). Interest rate increases in 2005 caused interest expense incurred by the securities industry to increase. The result was that, while gross revenues remained high, the increased interest expense caused pretax profits to fall to $17.6 billion in 2005. A surge in revenues from trading gains and corporate advisory services caused pretax profits to bounce back to 33.1 billion in 2006.

Signs of the impending financial crisis arose in 2007. The industry began 2007 on a strong note but, hit by the subprime mortgage market meltdown that began in the summer of 2007, it ended the year with pretax profits of just  $0.78 billion. Many revenue lines showed solid growth in 2007 and total revenues reached a record high of$ 474.2 billion in 2007. However, trading and investment account losses were large, totaling $6 billion in 2007, compared to a gain of $43 billion in 2006. Further, expenses grew faster than revenues, to a record $473.4 billion in 2007. The worst of the financial crisis hit in 2008 as the industry reported a record loss for the year of $34.1 billion. Revenues were $290.5 billion, down 38.7 percent from 2007. Nearly all revenue lines decreased from 2007 levels, with trading and investment account losses being the largest (-$65.0 billion in 2008).

As quickly as industry profits plunged during the financial crisis, they recovered in 2009. Pretax profits were a record  $71.4 billion. Revenues totaled$ 288.1 billion for the year. Commission and fee income was  $49.0 billion of the total, reflecting improved trading volume. Trading revenues, which had been negative for six consecutive quarters, grew to$ 45.3 billion. Industry expenses for 2009 were $212.4 billion, 33.7 percent below 2008 levels. Of this, interest expenses fell to just $21.9 billion, 82.2 percent below 2008 levels. While still in a fragile state, the industry seemed to be recovering along with the economy.

The U.S. and world economies grew very slowly after the financial crisis. While interest rates remained at historic lows, concerns about the health of Euro-zone economies and the U.S. fiscal cliff kept economic growth at a standstill. Memories of the financial crisis were still fresh in the minds of investors. Events such as the May 2010 "flash crash," the October 2011 collapse of MF Global Holdings, and the August 2012 trading glitch at Knight Capital caused individual and institutional investors to limit capital market activity. Industry pretax profits fell to  $34.8 billion,$ 14.2 billion, and 32.1 billion in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.

By the mid-2010s, while the industry had put most problems from the financial crisis behind it, the industry was affected by post-crisis consequences, with increased regulation on risk taking and capital requirements. Since 2013, many companies undertook strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations and to de-risk their firms. This led to balance sheet reductions as well as to downsizing or disposition of select businesses, trading products, and investments. In addition, corporate strategies increasingly focused on client services and away from making large bets through principal investments like hedge funds or risky trading activity for using the firm's capital. As regulations became stricter following the 2008 crisis, many large banks across the globe sold assets or were selling, and/or discontinuing, lines of operations, and are focusing more on their core competencies. A result of the new regulations is that profitability is down: pretax profits in 2013, 2014, and 2015 fell to  $26.3 billion,$ 27.0 billion, and $23.8 billion, respectively. In 2016 through 2018, the pretax profits rose because revenues grew faster than expenses. Revenues grew 34 percent from  $273.3 billion in 2015 to$ 366.9 billion in 2018, while expenses grew 29 percent from  $249.4 billion in 2015 to$ 322.2 billion in 2018. As a result, industry profits reached $44.7 billion in 2018, the highest level since 2010.

# Balance Sheets

The short-term nature of many of the assets in the portfolios of securities firms demonstrates that an important activity is trading/brokerage. As a broker, the securities firm receives a commission for handling the trade but does not take either an asset or liability position. Thus, many of the assets appearing on the balance sheets of securities firms are cash like money market instruments, not capital market positions. In the case of depository institutions, assets tend to be medium term from the lending position of the depository institutions. The consolidated balance sheet for the industry is shown in Table 16-7. Looking at the asset portfolio, receivables from other broker-dealers accounted for 29.3 percent of total assets, reverse repurchase agreements—securities purchased under agreements to resell (i.e., the broker gives a short-term loan to the repurchase agreement seller, see Chapter 5)—accounted for 29.1 percent of assets, and long positions in securities and commodities accounted for 22.6 percent of assets. Because of the extent to which this industry's balance sheet consists of financial market securities, the industry is subjected to particularly large levels of market risk and interest rate risk. Further, to the extent that many of these securities are foreign-issued securities, FI managers must be concerned with foreign exchange risk and sovereign risk as well (see Chapter 20).

A major similarity between securities firms and all other types of FIs is a high degree of financial leverage. That is, all of these firms hold high levels of debt that is used to finance an asset portfolio consisting primarily of financial securities. A difference in the funding is that securities firms tend to use liabilities that are extremely short-term and market based. With respect to liabilities, repurchase agreements—securities sold under agreement to repurchase—were the major source of funds (these are securities temporarily lent in exchange for cash received). Repurchase agreements amounted to 34.3 percent of total liabilities and equity. The other major sources of funds were payables to customers (21.5 percent), payables to other broker-dealers (11.9 percent), and securities and commodities sold short for future delivery (8.3 percent). Nearly 37 percent of the total liability financing was payables incurred in the transaction process. In contrast, depository institutions have fixed-term time and savings deposit liabilities.

Equity capital amounted to only 6.1 percent of total assets, while total capital (equity capital plus subordinated liabilities) accounted for 9.1 percent of total assets. These levels are generally below the levels held by commercial banks (11.3 percent in 2016).

8. What the trend in profitability in the securities industry has been over the last 25 years?
9. What the major assets held by broker-dealers are?
10. Why broker-dealers tend to hold less equity capital than commercial banks and thrifts?

One reason for their lower equity capital levels is that securities firm and investment bank balance sheets contain mostly tradable (liquid) securities compared to the relatively illiquid loans that represent a significant portion of banks' asset portfolios. However, this low level of capital can leave stand-alone investment banks vulnerable to runs. For example, in the summer of 2007, two Bear Stearns hedge funds suffered heavy losses on investments in the subprime mortgage market. The two funds filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 2007. Bear Stearns's market value was hurt badly from these losses. Because Bear Stearns operated with low levels of capital, the losses became so great that by March 2008 Bear Stearns was struggling to finance its day-to-day operations. Rumors of Bear Stearns's equity crisis became a reality as investors began quickly selling off their stock and draining what little equity the firm had left. Bear Stearns had no choice but to basically sell itself to the highest bidder to avoid declaring bankruptcy or completely closing down and leaving investors totally empty-handed. JPMorgan Chase purchased the company for  $236 million; Bear Stearns's skyscraper in New York was worth over$ 2 billion alone.

# REGULATION

# LG 16-4 www.sec.gov

The primary regulator of the securities industry has been the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), established in 1934 largely in response to abuses by securities firms that many at the time felt were partly responsible for the economic problems in the United States. The primary role of the SEC includes administration of securities laws, review and evaluation of registrations of new securities offerings (ensuring that all relevant information is revealed to potential investors), review and evaluation of annual and semiannual reports summarizing the financial status of all publicly held corporations, and the prohibition of any form of security market manipulation. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) of 1996 reaffirmed the significance of the SEC as the primary regulator of securities firms. According to the NSMIA, states are not allowed to require federally registered securities firms to be registered in a state as well. States are also prohibited from requiring registrations of securities firms' transactions and from imposing substantive requirements on private placements. Prior to NSMIA, most securities firms were subject to regulation from both the SEC and the state in which they operated. NSMIA provides that states may still require securities firms to pay fees and file documents submitted to the SEC, but most of the regulatory burden imposed by states has been removed. Thus, NSMIA effectively gives the SEC primary regulatory jurisdiction over securities firms.

The early 2000s saw a reversal of this trend toward the dominance of the SEC with states—especially their attorneys general—increasingly intervening through securities-related investigations. Several highly publicized securities violations resulted in criminal cases brought against securities law violators by state prosecutors. For example, the New York State attorney general forced Merrill Lynch to pay a  $100 million penalty because of allegations that Merrill Lynch brokers gave investors overly optimistic reports about the stock of its investment banking clients. In the spring of 2003 the issue culminated in an agreement between regulators and 10 of the nation's largest securities firms, with the latter agreeing to pay a record$ 1.4 billion in penalties to settle charges involving investor abuses. The long awaited settlement centered on charges that securities firms routinely issued overly optimistic stock research to investors in order to gain favor with corporate clients and win their investment banking business. The investigations of the SEC and other regulators, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and state regulators, unveiled multiple examples of how Wall Street stock analysts tailored their research reports and ratings to win investment banking business. The agreement also forced brokerage companies to make structural changes in the way they handle research—for example, preventing analysts from attending certain investment banking meetings. It also required that securities firms have separate reporting and supervisory structures for their research and banking operations and that analysts' pay be tied to the quality and accuracy of their research rather than the amount of investment banking business they generate.

Despite all of these changes, the industry continued to find itself in the midst of scandal and prosecution. In January 2011, a former analyst at Primary Global Research

LLC, Bob Nguyen, admitted he recruited employees of public companies specifically to help hedge funds and other investors obtain confidential information. In July 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing Peregrine Financial and its founder, Russell Wasendorf Sr., of committing fraud and customer-funds violations, and making false statements. The scandal left Wasendorf hospitalized after a suicide attempt while regulators tried to find out what happened to  $215 million of customer funds allegedly missing from the firm. In December 2012, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay$ 5 million to settle allegations that one of its senior investment bankers tried to improperly influence research analysts in the days before Facebook went public in May 2012. Allegations charged that the senior investment banker arranged phone calls from Facebook to analysts in a way that favored large investors over small investors and violated restrictions on investment bankers' role in the IPO process. In October 2013, JPMorgan and the Justice Department agreed to a  $13 billion settlement ($ 9 billion in penalties and $4 billion in consumer relief) to resolve claims that the bank misled investors about the quality of mortgages it sold to them during the housing boom. (However, less than two weeks after the settlement announcement, the agreement was at risk of collapsing because of disagreements related to a criminal probe of the bank and its effort to get penalties reimbursed by a government-controlled fund.) A week earlier, JPMorgan agreed to pay  $920 million and admitted wrongdoing to settle claims with four regulators tied to the London "whale" trading blunder that cost the bank more than$ 6 billion in 2012. The bank also agreed to pay  $80 million to settle claims related to its credit card practices and$ 410 million for manipulating electricity markets. In December 2014 Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and eight other securities firms were fined a total of $43.5 million for offering favorable stock research in hopes of winning underwriting business in an initial public offering by Toys "R" Us. In March 2015, JPMorgan Chase admitted to misfiling more than 50,000 payment change notices in bankruptcy courts that were "improperly signed, under penalty of perjury, by persons who had not reviewed the accuracy of the notices." The bank agreed to pay more than $50 million to homeowners as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over its mortgage practices. Enforcement actions filed by the SEC have averaged around 810 per year from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018. A significant number of the Commission's stand-alone cases in fiscal year 2017 concerned securities offerings (approximately 25 percent), investment advisory issues (22 percent), and issuer reporting/accounting and auditing (16 percent). The SEC also brought actions relating to broker-dealer misconduct (13 percent), insider trading (10 percent) and market manipulation (7 percent). In fiscal year 2018, parties in the Commission's actions and proceedings were ordered to pay a total of $2.51 billion in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a decrease over the prior year. Penalties imposed totaled 1.44 billion, an increase from the prior year.

While the SEC sets the overall regulatory standards for the industry, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is involved in the day-to-day regulation of trading practices. In contrast to the SEC which is a government-run regulator, FINRA is an independent, not-for-profit organization authorized by Congress to protect America's investors by making sure the securities industry operates fairly and honestly. Specifically, FINRA writes and enforces rules governing the activities of securities firms, examines firms for compliance with those rules, works to foster market transparency, and supports investor education. FINRA monitors trading abuses (such as insider trading), trading rule violations, and securities firms' capital (solvency positions)—such as the 2 percent net worth to assets minimum capital ratio. FINRA also performs market regulation under contract for the major U.S. stock exchanges. For example, in January 2013 FINRA announced that it is expanding its oversight of dark pool trading (see Chapter 8). Dark pools are trades created by institutional orders away from central exchanges. Asset managers sometimes prefer dark pools to exchanges because orders remain hidden until they are executed, which can help investors get a better price on large trades. The details of the trades are unavailable to the public (i.e., the public is in the dark about these trades). According to Tabb Group, about 13 percent of all stock trades in the United States occurred through dark pools as of 2018, up from 3 percent in 2007. As more financial trading has occurred in dark pools, regulators and investors have become concerned that firms are placing orders on exchanges and in dark pools at the same time to move stock prices to their advantage. FINRA's expanded oversight is intended to monitor and determine whether orders placed in dark pools are indeed attempts at moving stock prices. FINRA also announced that it is increasing its surveillance of high-speed and rapid-fire trading across exchanges. As a result of the increased oversight, in 2014 Goldman Sachs announced that it would close its dark pool, one of the world's largest. The company stated that the revenue the dark pool was generating for the bank was not worth the risks that had been highlighted by a series of trading glitches and growing criticism of dark pools. Also, as a result of the new oversight, UBS agreed to pay 14.5 million to settle accusations by the SEC that a subsidiary violated federal securities laws in its operation of a dark pool. The UBS subsidiary allegedly allowed traders to buy and sell stocks priced at increments smaller than a penny and it failed to adequately disclose this system to all investors in its market. Based on series of enforcement actions that found some dark pools misled clients about how they worked, the SEC passed a regulation in July 2018 to require the trading platforms to tell investors more about how they handle orders and any preferential deals they cut with clients. The measure moves dark pools closer to the regulatory treatment of stock exchanges, which must disclose how their systems match orders.

Also overseeing this industry at the federal level is the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was created with the broad mandate to determine whether any changes are required in U.S. law to better protect the public. In the spring of 2010, a subcommittee hearing focused on the contributing role of investment banks in the financial crisis. Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs bundled toxic mortgages into complex financial instruments, many of which were rated AAA by credit-rating agencies, and sold them to investors. Goldman Sachs, in an attempt to manage its own risk on these securities, shorted the mortgage market, setting itself up for gains that would offset losses on the mortgage securities. The subcommittee brought up evidence and internal Goldman documents that showed Goldman knew the housing market was on the brink of collapse but continued to sell mortgage-backed securities to investors. All the while, Goldman allegedly bet against the securities it built and sold with the knowledge that the housing market's collapse would bring the firm a sizable payday.

The financial crisis reshaped much of the securities firms and investment banking industry. In response, regulators were charged with reshaping regulations to prevent events similar to those that led to the market collapse and the near collapse of this industry. The 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act set forth many changes in the way securities firms and investment banks are regulated. The bill's Financial Services Oversight Council of financial regulators was given oversight of the industry in its charge to identify emerging systemic risks. Also under the act, effective July 21, 2011, the dollar threshold for determining whether an investment advisor must register under federal or state law increased: generally, all advisors with assets under management of under  $100 million must register with state regulators and those with over$ 100 million under management must register with the SEC. Prior to that date, only advisors with assets under management of under 25 million registered with a state regulator. The bill also gave new authority for the Federal Reserve to supervise all firms that could pose a threat to financial stability and called for stronger capital and other prudential standards for all financial firms—and even higher standards for large, interconnected firms.

The bill gave authority to the government to resolve nonbank financial institutions whose failure could have serious systemic effects and revised the Federal Reserve's emergency lending authority to improve accountability. Investment banks also saw stricter oversight as the bill called for the regulation of securitization markets, stronger regulation of credit-rating agencies, a requirement that issuers and originators retain a financial interest in securitized loans, comprehensive regulation of all over-the-counter derivatives, and new authority for the Federal Reserve to oversee payment, clearing, and settlement systems. The act further mandated that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading be moved to listed futures markets and cleared through a registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO) or exchange. The process was implemented in three stages during 2013. The first stage, for Category 1 entities (which included mostly swap dealers and major swap participants), was implemented on March 11, 2013. The second stage, for Category 2 entities (which included

12. What regulatory changes resulted from the financial crisis?

a much larger group of more than 100 firms), was implemented on June 11 and the third stage, for Category 3 entities (which included all others involved in swap transactions), was implemented on September 11. Under the new regulations, investment banks and brokerage firms may face an increase in their information technology capital and operating costs, as well as an increase in compliance and legal costs. Further, under the new rules, these FIs could face potential risks to principal investing and capital levels for market making.

Finally, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) protects investors against losses of up to 500,000 on securities firm failures. SIPC is not an agency or establishment of the U.S. government and it has no authority to investigate or regulate its member broker-dealers. Rather, the SIPC was created under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 as a nonprofit membership corporation. SIPC oversees the liquidation of member broker-dealers that close when the broker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial trouble and customer assets are missing. While agencies such as the SEC and FINRA deal with cases of investment fund fraud, the SIPC's focus is both different and narrow: restoring customer cash and securities left in the hands of bankrupt or otherwise financially troubled brokerage firms. The fund does not protect against losses on customers' accounts due to poor investment choices that reduce the value of their portfolio. The SIPC is funded with premium contributions from member firms.

More so than other sectors of the financial institutions industry, securities firms and investment banks operate globally. Both U.S. and European investment banks compete for business worldwide. This can be seen in Table 16-3 as four of the top five underwriters of global debt are U.S. investment banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo) and one is a European bank (Barclays). In 2019 M&A deals involving U.S. targets, 7 of the top 10 advisors were U.S. investment banks (including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase) and 3 were European banks (including Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank).

As domestic securities trading and underwriting grew in the 1990s and 2000s, so did foreign securities trading and underwriting. Figures 16-4 and 16-5 show the foreign transactions in U.S. securities and U.S. transactions in foreign securities from 2003 to 2018. For example, foreign investors' transactions involving U.S. stocks increased from  $6,173.7 billion in 2003 to$ 24,031.1 billion in 2008, before falling to  $13,155.2 billion in 2009, during the financial crisis. As of 2018, stock transactions had increased back to$ 36,293.0 billion, well above the pre-crisis level. Similarly, U.S. investors' transactions involving stocks listed on foreign exchanges grew from  $2,697.7 billion in 2003 to$ 10,866.3 billion in 2008, before falling to $6,398.4 in 2009 and recovering to $11,906.5 billion in 2018.

Table 16-8 reports the total dollar value of international security offerings from 1995 to 2018. Over this period, total offerings increased from 443.3 billion in 1995 to 3,781.7 billion in 2007, and then decreased in 2008 during the financial crisis to 3,349.7 billion. As the economy recovered in 2009, so did international securities offerings, increasing to 3,877.2 billion in 2009. But the recovery was short-lived, as new issues decreased to 2,840.0 billion in 2011. By 2018, total value of international security offerings stood at 3,067.1 billion. Of the amounts in 2018, U.S. security issuers offered 564.2 billion in international markets, up from 72.9 billion in 1995.

One result of the financial crisis in the late 2000s was that large investment banks around the world became more concerned than ever with capital, liquidity, and leverage. However, they did not want to lose ground in the global competition for clients. The result was that global investment banks looked for strategic alliances that would allow them to compete in foreign markets or they exited foreign markets altogether. For example, in 2008 Morgan Stanley, in need of capital to bolster its balance sheet, sold a 21 percent stake in the firm to the Japanese financial institution, Mitsubishi UFJ. In March 2009, the two announced plans to form a joint venture that combined each firm's Japan-based securities business. Morgan Stanley took 40 percent ownership and managerial control of the institutional business and Mitsubishi took the remaining ownership and control of the retail operations. This kind of arrangement provides U.S.-based investment banks with a foothold alongside a domestic firm in the foreign market. In contrast to the strategic alliance between Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ, Citigroup decided to abandon several

During the financial crisis, Citigroup had to deal with growing U.S. government ownership, a deteriorating credit environment, and an unwieldy structure.

It also sold NikkoCiti Trust and Banking Corp. to Nomura Trust & Banking Co. Moves such as the sale of international properties, originally acquired to allow the investment bank to expand globally, will likely continue to play a part in the reshaping of the global investment banking industry.

As discussed in Chapter 5, one of the more grievous actions by some global investment banks during the financial crisis was the manipulation of the LIBOR. LIBOR is the average of the interest rates submitted by major banks in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom in a variety of major currencies such as the dollar, euro, and yen. The After the Crisis box summarizes the allegations that several large banks tried to manipulate the LIBOR rate during the financial crisis.

The scandal became widely public in June 2012 when British investment bank Barclays agreed to pay  $450 million to settle allegations by U.S. and British authorities that some of its traders attempted to manipulate LIBOR rates to increase the bank's profits and reduce concerns about its stability during the financial crisis. Then in December 2012, UBS agreed to pay about$ 1.5 billion to settle charges that it manipulated LIBOR. Also in December, the U.S. Justice Department charged Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, with conspiracy to commit fraud by manipulating the LIBOR (in June 2013, he was charged with eight counts of fraud as part of the UK investigation). In February 2013, the Royal Bank of Scotland decided to settle charges that it manipulated LIBOR at a cost of $610 million. Also in early 2013, Deutsche Bank stated that it had set aside money to cover potential fines associated with its role in the manipulation of the LIBOR. While several big banks pleaded guilty to and accepted penalties for manipulating LIBOR, the first criminal conviction of an individual occurred in August 2015. Former bank trader Tom Hayes was sentenced to 14 years in prison after a London jury convicted him of trying to fraudulently rig the LIBOR. The unanimous jury verdict delivered one of the harshest penalties against a banker since the financial crisis. Finally, in 2016 U.S. and British regulators fined six major global banks (Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Bank of America) a total of nearly $6 billion for rigging the foreign exchange market and LIBOR interest rates. Forex traders from the banks had met in online chat room groups, one brazenly named "the Cartel" and another "Mafia," to set rates that cheated customers while adding to their own profits.

Also in 2013, U.S. investigators uncovered evidence that several investment banks had instructed a small group of brokers at ICAP to manipulate a benchmark for interest rate swaps, ISDAfix, in order to reap millions of dollars in trading profits at the expense

# Traders Influenced LIBOR Rates

A group of traders and brokers successfully managed to manipulate key interbank lending rates that affected loans around the world, one of the banks being investigated told Canadian regulators (reported in The Wall Street Journal). Canada's Competition Bureau said in a court filing in Ottawa that a bank it did not identify told the agency's investigators that people involved "were able to move" interest rates. According to The Wall Street Journal, the "cooperating party" was Swiss bank UBS, which said earlier that it had been granted some immunity by Switzerland's antitrust authority in return for cooperating with its probe into the potential manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.

No banks or individuals were charged with wrongdoing. Lawyers acting for the cooperating bank told the regulator that traders at six banks on the yen LIBOR panel—Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS—influenced the rates. The traders used e-mails and instant messages to tell each other whether they wanted "to see a higher or lower yen LIBOR (rate) to aid their trading position(s)," The Wall Street Journal reported. They then "entered into agreements to submit artificially high or artificially low" quotes. However, the Journal reported that not all attempts to affect LIBOR submissions were successful.

The Competition Bureau said it had been investigating certain financial firms as part of a widening global probe into how banks set key interbank lending rates. The Canadian regulator said it had investigated whether the traders also " conspired" with individuals at interdealer broker firms. Two London-based interdealer brokers ICAP PLC and RP Martin Holdings Ltd. were under investigation. Regulators since late 2010 had been investigating banks that helped set interbank lending rates known as LIBOR and TIBOR in London and Tokyo, which are used to set interest rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of securities. More than a dozen traders and brokers in London and Asia were fired, suspended, or put on leave as part of the probe, the Financial Times reported.

Source: Sakthi Prasad, Reuters Business News, February 17, 2012 of companies and pension funds. Among the investment banks implicated were Barclays, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and the Royal Bank of Scotland—the same banks implicated for rigging the LIBOR. The rigging of ISDAfix adds to growing evidence that a small group of influential investment banks have gained financially by distorting key financial gauges in world markets on everything from interest rates to currencies to commodities.

# SUMMARY

This chapter presented an overview of security firms, which primarily offer retail services to investors, and investment banking firms, which primarily offer activities and services related to corporate customers. Firms in this industry help bring new issues of debt and equity to the financial markets. In addition, this industry facilitates the trading and market making of securities after they are issued. The chapter discussed the structure of the industry and changes in the degree of concentration in firm size in the industry over the last three decades. Balance sheet information that highlighted the major assets and liabilities of the firms was also analyzed.
