## INVESTMENT COMPANIES: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Investment companies are financial institutions that pool the financial resources of individuals and companies and invest those resources in (diversified) portfolios of assets. Open-end mutual funds (the largest portion of investment company business) sell new shares to investors and redeem outstanding shares on demand at their fair market values. They provide opportunities for small investors to invest in a liquid and diversified portfolio of financial securities at a lower price per unit of risk than could be achieved by investing in individual securities. A single share of a mutual fund could represent ownership in over a thousand different companies. Whereas the investment in the mutual fund might cost  \$100, buying over a thousand individual shares of stock could cost over $100,000 dollars. Further, since mutual funds can buy and sell securities in large blocks, their trading costs are much lower than those of the individual investor buying a few shares at a time.

Hedge funds are a type of investment pool that solicits funds from (wealthy) individuals and other investors (e.g., commercial banks) and invests these funds on their behalf. Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that they are pooled investment vehicles that accept investors' money and generally invest it on a collective basis. Investments in hedge funds, however, are restricted to more wealthy clients. This chapter presents an overview of the services offered by investment companies and highlights their rapid growth in the last several decades.

## SIZE, STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITION OF THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY

LG 17-1

### Historical Trends

The first mutual fund was established in Boston in 1924. The industry grew very slowly at first, so that by 1970, 361 funds held about 50 billion in assets. Since then, the number of funds and the asset size of the industry have increased dramatically. This growth is attributed to the advent of money market mutual funds in 1972 (as investors looked for ways to earn market rates on short-term funds when regulatory ceilings constrained the interest rates they earned on bank deposits), to tax-exempt money market mutual funds first established in 1979, and to an explosion of special-purpose equity, bond, emerging market, and derivative funds (as capital market values soared in the 1990s). Money market mutual funds invest in securities with an original maturity under one year, while long-term funds invest in securities with an original maturity generally over one year.

Table 17-1 documents the tremendous increase in mutual funds for various years from 1940 though 2019. For example, total assets invested in mutual funds increased from  \$0.5 billion in 1940 to\$ 11,999.7 billion in 2007. In addition, the number of mutual funds increased from 68 in 1940 to 8,040 in 2007. $^{1}$  The majority of this increase occurred during the bull market run in the 1990s (total mutual fund assets in 1990 were \$1,065.2 billion). The tremendous increase in the market value of financial assets such as equities in the 1990s and the relatively low transaction cost opportunity that mutual funds provide to investors (particularly small investors) who want to hold such assets (through either direct mutual fund purchases or contributions to retirement funds sponsored by employers and managed by mutual funds—see Chapter 18) caused the mutual fund industry to boom. However, the dramatic decline in the equity markets in the early 2000s eroded some of this growth. The 2008–2009 financial crisis and the collapse in stock and other security prices produced the largest drop ever recorded in the value of industry assets. During 2008, mutual fund losses on investments in financial securities and liquidation of mutual fund shares by investors resulted in a drop in industry assets of \$2.4 trillion (or 20 percent). At the end of 2008, total assets fell to 9,620.3 billion. Investor demand for certain types of mutual funds plummeted, driven in large part by deteriorating financial market conditions. Equity funds suffered substantial outflows, while the inflow to U.S. government money market funds reached record highs. As the economy recovered in 2009, so did

Additionally, growth has been driven by the rise in retirement funds under management by mutual funds. The retirement fund market has increased from  \$4.0 trillion in 1990 to\$ 32.3 trillion in 2019. Mutual funds manage approximately a quarter of this market and have experienced growth along with it. Many of these retirement funds are institutional funds. Institutional funds are mutual funds that manage retirement plans for an institution's employees (see Chapter 18). Also popular among retirement funds are target date funds (also known as lifecycle funds) and lifestyle funds (also known as target risk funds). Target date funds follow a predetermined reallocation of risk over time, and lifestyle funds maintain a predetermined risk level. The funds are aimed at a specific retirement year and are an aggregation of many—sometimes as many as 25—mutual funds. Lifecycle funds diversify and rebalance investors' portfolios as they approach retirement. They start with an aggressive mix of equities and bonds in the decades before retirement and rebalance to maintain diversification. The funds become more conservative as retirement nears, selling stocks and buying bonds.

As Figure 17-1 illustrates, in terms of asset size, the mutual fund (money market and long-term mutual funds) industry is larger than the insurance industry and slightly larger than the depository institutions industry. Through the end of 2018, the depository institutions industry was the largest FI group, but the mutual fund industry surpassed the depository institutions industry in size in 2019. Other types of FIs have noticed the tremendous growth in this area of FI services and have sought to directly compete by either buying existing mutual fund groups or managing mutual fund assets for a fee. For example, banks' share of all mutual fund assets managed grew to 4 percent in 2019. Much of this growth has occurred through banks' buying mutual fund companies, for example, Mellon buying Dreyfus, as well as converting internally managed trust funds into open-end mutual funds. Insurance companies are also participants in this market. In March 2001, for example, State Farm began offering a family of 10 mutual funds nationwide. The funds are available from more than 9,000 registered State Farm agents, on the Internet, or by application sent in response to phone requests made to a toll-free number. As of 2019, insurance companies managed 4 percent of the mutual fund industry's assets.

Low barriers to entry in the U.S. mutual fund industry have allowed new entrants to offer funds to compete for investor attention. Despite this, the share of industry assets held by the largest mutual fund sponsors has changed little since 1990. For example, the largest 25 companies that sponsor mutual funds managed 80 percent of the industry's assets in 2019, slightly larger than 76 percent in 1990.

### equity funds

Funds consisting of common and preferred stock securities.

#### LG 17-2

### bond funds

Funds consisting of fixed-income capital market debt securities.

### hybrid funds

Funds consisting of both stock and bond securities.

### money market mutual funds (MMMFs)

Funds consisting of various mixtures of money market securities.

### Different Types of Mutual Funds

The mutual fund industry is usually considered to have two sectors: short-term funds and long-term funds. Long-term funds comprise equity funds (composed of common and preferred stock securities), bond funds (composed of fixed-income securities with a maturity of over one year), and hybrid funds (composed of both stock and bond securities). Short-term funds comprise taxable money market mutual funds (MMMFs) and tax-exempt money market mutual funds (containing various mixes of those money market securities with an original maturity of less than one year, discussed in Chapter 5). Long-term equity funds typically are well diversified, and the risk is more systematic or market based. Bond funds have extensive interest rate risk because of their long-term, fixed-rate nature. Sector, or industry-specific, funds have systematic (market) and unsystematic risk, regardless of whether they are equity or bond funds. The principal type of risk for short-term funds is interest rate risk because of the predominance of fixed-income securities. Because of the shortness of maturity of the assets, which often is less than 60 days, this risk is mitigated to a large extent. Short-term funds generally have virtually no liquidity or default risk because of the types of assets held.

Tables 17-2 and 17-3 report the growth of bond and equity as well as hybrid mutual funds relative to money market mutual funds from 1980 through 2019. As can be seen, the 1990s saw a strong trend toward investing in equity mutual funds, reflecting the rise in share values during the 1990s. As a result, in 2000, 73.5 percent of all mutual fund assets were in long-term funds while the remaining funds, or 26.5 percent, were in money market mutual funds. However, in the early 2000s, as interest rates rose, the U.S. economy weakened, and stock returns fell, the growth of money market funds increased relative to the growth of long-term funds. In the mid-2000s, the U.S. economy grew and stock values increased. As a result, the share of long-term funds grew (to 74.3 percent of all funds in 2007), while money market funds decreased (to 25.7 percent in 2007).

The 2008-2009 financial crisis and the collapse in stock prices produced a sharp drop in long-term mutual fund activity. Equity funds suffered substantial outflows, while the inflow to U.S. government money market funds reached record highs. At the end of 2008, the share of long-term equity and bond funds plunged to 60.2 percent of all funds, while money market funds increased to 39.8 percent. As discussed below, part of the move to money market funds was the fact that during the worst of the financial crisis, the U.S. Treasury extended government insurance to all money market mutual fund accounts on a temporary basis. In 2009, as the economy and the stock market recovered, the share of long-term equity and bond funds increased back to 70.2 percent of all funds, while money market funds fell to 29.8 percent. By 2019, the share of long-term equity and bond funds was 83.0 percent of all funds, while money market funds decreased to 17.0 percent.

Money market mutual funds provide an alternative investment opportunity to interest-bearing deposits at commercial banks, which may explain the increase in MMMFs in the 1980s and early 2000s when the spread earned on MMMFs investments relative to deposits was mostly positive. Both investments are relatively safe and earn short-term returns. The major difference between the two is that interest-bearing deposits (below 250,000) are fully insured by the FDIC but, because of bank regulatory costs (such as reserve requirements, capital adequacy requirements, and deposit insurance premiums), generally offer lower returns than noninsured MMMFs.2 Thus, the net gain in switching to MMMFs is a higher return in exchange for the loss of FDIC deposit insurance coverage. Many investors appeared willing to give up FDIC insurance coverage to obtain additional returns in the late 1980s and late 1990s through 2001.

An exception occurred during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In September 2008, the Primary Reserve Fund, a large and reputedly conservative money market fund, had holdings of  \$785 million in commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers. As a result of Lehman's failure, shares in the Primary Reserve Fund "broke the buck" (i.e., fell below\$ 1), meaning that its investors lost part of their principal investment. This was the first-ever incidence of a share price dip below a dollar for any money market mutual fund open to the general public. This type of fund had built a reputation for safe investment. Exposure to Lehman's failure scared investors, leading to a broad run on money market mutual funds. Within a few days, more than 200 billion had flowed out of these funds. The U.S. Treasury stopped the run by extending government insurance to all money market mutual fund accounts held in participating money market funds as of the close of business on September 19, 2008. The insurance coverage lasted for one year (through September 18, 2009). Still, as Figure 17-2 shows, outflows from money market funds more than offset inflows to long-term funds in 2009 and 2010. Overall demand for mutual funds as measured by net new cash flow—new fund sales less redemptions plus net exchanges continued to be weak in 2011. In 2011, global financial markets were shaken by the debt crisis in the eurozone and the U.S. debt ceiling showdown and ongoing fiscal difficulties. The creditworthiness of many major European banks was called into question because of their exposure to sovereign bonds issued by Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. Volatility in equity markets worldwide spiked as well. 2012 through 2015 showed positive net new cash flow for the mutual fund industry, mostly driven by inflows to long-term funds.

Following two consecutive years of outflows (2015 and 2016), mutual fund net new cash flow has rebounded in 2017. A number of factors—including broad-based gains in financial markets, ongoing demographic trends, and increased demand for indexed products—appeared to influence long-term mutual fund flows in 2017. Inflows to money market funds were likely driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to increase the federal funds rate three times in 2017. As a result, yields on money market funds ratched up in 2017 and far exceeded the stated rate on money market deposit accounts (MMDAs). In 2019, mutual funds had net inflows of  \$454 billion (2.6 percent of year-end 2018 total net assets), following net outflows of\$ 187 billion in 2018. Long-term mutual funds experienced net outflows of \$99 billion in 2019, as inflows to bond funds were more than offset by outflows from equity and hybrid funds. Money market funds received \$553 billion in net inflows, which were likely driven by relatively attractive yields on short-term assets in 2019. A number of factors—including portfolio rebalancing, broad-based increases in global financial markets, ongoing demographic trends, and increased demand for indexed products—appeared to influence US mutual fund flows in 2019.

Table 17-3 reports the growth in the mutual fund industry based on the number of funds in existence from 1985 through 2019. All categories of funds have generally increased in number in this time period, from a total of 1,528 in 1985 to 8,040 in 2007. Also, the number of equity funds boomed in the 1990s: equity funds numbered 4,737 in 2007, up from 1,099 in 1990, while bond funds numbered 2,002 in 2007, up from 1,047 in 1990. But again, the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the collapse in financial markets produced a significant drop in the number of mutual funds. The number of equity and bond funds was 4,589 and 1,889, respectively, by the end of 2009. The total number of funds dropped below 8,000 for the first time since 1999. In terms of the number of funds, the industry still had not recovered from the crisis. As the U.S. economy recovered in the mid-2010s, the trends reversed. In 2019, the number of equity funds increased to 4,651 and the total number of funds was 7,945.

Notice that in Table 17-2, households (i.e., small investors) own the majority of both longand short-term funds, 50.5 percent for long-term mutual funds and 36.6 percent for short-term mutual funds in 2016. This is to be expected, given that by pooling investments from a large number of small investors, fund managers are able to hold well-diversified portfolios of assets. In addition, managers can obtain lower transaction costs because of the volume of transactions, both in dollars and numbers, and they benefit from research, information, and monitoring activities at reduced costs. Many small investors are able to gain benefits of the money and capital markets by using mutual funds. Once an account is opened in a fund, a small amount of money can be invested on a periodic basis. In many cases, the amount of the investment would be insufficient for direct access to the money and capital markets. On the other hand, corporations are more likely to be able to diversify by holding a large bundle of individual securities and assets, and money and capital markets are easily accessible by direct investment. Further, an argument can be made that the goal of corporations should be to maximize shareholder wealth, not to be diversified.

As of 2019, 58.5 million U.S. households (45.5 percent) owned mutual funds. Percentage of U.S. households owning mutual funds remained around 45.0 percent since 2000, significant increase from 5.7 percent in 1980. Table 17-4 lists some characteristics of household mutual fund owners as of 2019. Most are long-term owners, with 51 percent making their first purchases before 2000. While mutual fund investors come from all age groups, ownership is concentrated among individuals in their prime saving and investing years. 67 percent of households owning mutual funds in 2019 were headed by individuals between the ages of 39 and 73. Interestingly, the number of families headed by a person with less than a college degree investing in mutual funds is 46 percent. The typical fund-owning household has  \$150,000 invested in four mutual funds. Compared to 1995, 2019 has seen a slight increase in the median age of mutual fund holders (from 44 years to 51 years) and a large increase in median household financial assets owned (from\$ 50,000 to 250,000). Further, holdings of equity funds have increased from 73 percent to 88 percent of all

# Other Types of Investment Company Funds

While mutual funds dominate the investment company industry, two other types of funds are managed by these firms: closed-end funds and unit investment trusts.

# open-end mutual fund

A fund for which the supply of shares is not fixed but can increase or decrease daily with purchases and redemptions of shares.

# closed-end investment companies

Specialized investment companies that have a fixed supply of outstanding shares.

# real estate investment trust (REIT)

A closed-end investment company that specializes in investing in mortgages, property, or real estate company shares.

Closed-End Funds. Mutual funds are open ended in that the number of shares outstanding fluctuates daily with the amount of share redemptions and new purchases. Shares are redeemable (meaning that investors buy and sell shares from and to the mutual fund company at their approximate net asset value [NAV, see below] that is set once a day, after markets close). Thus, the demand for shares determines the number of shares outstanding. Open-end mutual funds can be compared with regular corporations whose stock shares are traded on stock exchanges and to closed-end investment companies, both of which have a fixed number of shares outstanding at any given time. Closed-end funds generally do not continuously offer their shares for sale. Rather, they sell a fixed number of shares at one time (in an initial public offering), after which the shares typically trade on a secondary market. For example, real estate investment trusts (REITs) are closed-end investment companies that specialize in investing in real estate company shares and/or in buying mortgages.

For most closed-end company funds, investors generally buy and sell the company's shares that trade continuously during the day on a stock exchange as they do for corporate stocks. Since the number of shares available for purchase, at any moment in time, is fixed, the NAV of the fund's shares is determined by the value of the underlying shares as well as by the demand for the investment company's shares themselves. When demand for the investment company's shares is high (as was the case in the midand late 1990s when stock markets boomed) because the supply of shares in the fund is fixed, the shares can trade for more than the NAV of the securities held in the fund's asset portfolio. In this case, the fund is said to be trading at a premium (i.e., more than the fair market value of the securities held). When demand for the shares is low (as was the case in 2001 and 2008–2009 when stock market values fell), the value of the closed-end fund's shares can fall to less than the NAV of its assets. In this case, its shares are said to be trading at a discount (i.e., less than the fair market value of the securities held). In 2019, \$277.7 billion was invested in 500 closed-end funds, compared to \$21.3 trillion invested in 7,945 open-end mutual funds.

# unit investment trust (UIT)

A fund that sells a fixed number of redeemable shares that are redeemed on a set termination date.

Unit Investment Trusts. Unit investment trusts (UITs) have characteristics of both mutual funds and closed-end funds. Like mutual funds, UITs issue redeemable shares (so-called units). Like closed-end funds, UITs typically issue only a fixed number of shares. Unlike mutual funds and closed-end funds, however, UITs have a termination date that is set when the UIT is established and differs according to the investments held in the portfolio. UITs are generally fixed portfolios of securities (up to 20 specific stocks or bonds) that see little or no change over the life of the UIT. Thus, investors know what they are investing in for the period of their investment. Upon termination of the UIT, proceeds from the sale of the securities are either paid to UIT holders or reinvested in another UIT. In 2019, 79.1 billion was invested in 4,571 UITs.

# MUTUAL FUND RETURNS AND COSTS

The return to mutual fund investors can vary widely, depending on the objective of the fund, fees charged on the fund, and general market conditions. This section provides an overview of these issues.

# Mutual Fund Prospectuses and Objectives

Regulations require that mutual fund managers specify the investment objectives of their funds in a prospectus available to potential investors. This prospectus also includes a list of the securities that the fund holds. The aggregate figures for long-term funds (in Table 17-2) tend to obscure the fact that many different funds fall into this group of funds. Table 17-5 classifies 13 major categories of investment objectives for mutual funds, with the assets allocated to each of these major categories. The fund objective described in its prospectus provides general information about the types of securities the mutual fund holds as assets. For example, "capital appreciation" funds hold securities (mainly equities) of the highest growth and highest-risk firms. Again, within each of these 13 categories of mutual funds are a multitude of different funds offered by mutual fund companies. Historically, mutual funds have had to send out lengthy prospectuses describing their objectives and investments. In 1998, the SEC adopted a new procedure in which key sections of all fund prospectuses must be written in "plain English" instead of overly legal language. The idea is to increase the ability of investors to understand the risks related to the investment objectives or profile of a fund. An individual's preferences for a mutual fund's objective

often change over time. It is quite likely that people in the early years of investing, 20 and 30 years old, would prefer a fairly aggressive high-growth type of fund. As these people mature into their forties and fifties and retirement becomes a bit more imminent, they may switch to a fund with more of a balance between income and growth. In their later years, investors may try to protect their savings by switching to higher-yield stock and bond funds.

Table 17-6 lists the largest 20 mutual funds in total assets held in May 2020, including the fund's total assets; 1-year, 5-year and 10-year returns; net asset value (discussed below); expense ratio; and any initial fees (discussed below). Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Institutional Class (ticket: VSMPX) was the largest fund at the time. American Funds and Vanguard offered 18 of the top 20 funds measured by asset size. Not all of the top 20 funds performed well over the past year. Over the three time periods (1-year, 5-year, and 10-year), the S&P 500 index saw annual returns of 6.70 percent, 9.01 percent, and 12.83 percent, respectively. Of the 20 largest mutual funds, four outperformed the S&P 500 index over the 1-year period, two outperformed it over 5-year period, and two outperformed over the 10-year period.

Index Funds. A growing number of the long-term mutual funds are index funds in which fund managers buy securities in proportions similar to those included in a specified major stock index (such as the Vanguard Institutional Index Fund: Institutional Shares, which seeks to match the investment performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index). These funds are in contrast to actively managed funds, which are managed by an individual manager or a team of managers attempting to beat a benchmark index for their fund. In 2019, 492 index funds managed total net assets of  \$4.3 trillion, compared to 7,089 active funds with net assets of\$ 13.4 trillion. Because little research or aggressive management is necessary for index funds, management fees (discussed below) are lower. However, returns are often higher than more actively managed funds. For example, from data analyzed by Morningstar over the period 2009-2019, it was found that actively managed funds generally underperformed index funds across most asset classes examined. Active funds that invest in foreign large value stocks, foreign small-mid blend stocks, diversified emerging market stocks, European stocks, and high-yield bonds were the only fund categories of the 20 categories Morningstar studies that had higher 10-year returns than their passive counterparts. Active funds with below-average costs were more likely to outperform higher-cost active funds over the decade studied.

Exchange-Traded Funds. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are long-term mutual funds that are also designed to replicate a particular stock market index. (In February 2008 the SEC gave approval for the first actively managed ETF and a growing number of them are now actively managed.) While legally classified as open-end mutual funds, ETFs are similar to closed-end funds in that a fixed number of shares are outstanding at any point in time. Further, unlike open-end funds, where the price per share (or net asset value, NAV, see below) is determined only once a day after markets have closed, ETFs trade intraday on a stock exchange at prices that are determined by the market. Like a mutual fund, an ETF offers investors a proportionate share in a pool of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Table 17-7 summarizes some of the main differences and similarities of open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and ETFs.

ETFs may be bought or sold through a broker or in a brokerage account, like trading shares of any publicly traded company. While ETFs are registered with the SEC as investment companies, they differ from traditional mutual funds both in how their shares are issued and redeemed and in how their shares or units are traded. Specifically, ETF shares are created when an institutional investor deposits a specified block of securities with the ETF. In return for this deposit, the institutional investor receives a fixed amount of ETF shares, some or all of which may then be sold on a stock exchange. The institutional investor may obtain its deposited securities by redeeming the same number of ETF shares it received from the ETF. Individual investors can buy and sell the ETF shares only when they are listed on an exchange. Unlike an institutional investor, a retail investor cannot purchase or redeem shares directly from the ETF, as with a traditional mutual fund.

TABLE 17-7 Differences among Open-End Mutual Funds, Closed-End Mutual Funds, and ETFs

<table><tr><td></td><td>Open-End Mutual Fund</td><td>Closed-End Mutual Fund</td><td>ETF</td></tr><tr><td>Number of shares</td><td>No limit on shares</td><td>Fixed number of shares</td><td>Fixed number of shares</td></tr><tr><td>Trading</td><td>Shares not traded on an exchange, but bought from and sold to fund</td><td>Shares traded on an exchange</td><td>Shares traded on an exchange</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Price based on NAV</td><td>Price based on supply and demand, not NAV</td><td>Price based on NAV</td></tr><tr><td>Intraday trading</td><td>Trades at market close only</td><td>Trading occurs all day</td><td>Trading occurs all day</td></tr></table>

ETFs include funds such as SPDRs and Vanguard's Large-Cap VIPERS funds. Like index funds, the share price of an ETF changes over time in response to a change in the stock prices underlying a stock index. Further, since both ETFs and index funds are intended to track a specific index, management of the funds is relatively simple and management fees are lower than those for actively managed mutual funds. Unlike index funds, however, ETFs can be traded during the day, they can be purchased on margin, and they can be sold short by an investor who expects a drop in the underlying index value. Because ETFs behave like stocks, investors are subject to capital gains taxes only when they sell their shares. Thus, ETF investors can defer capital gains for as long as they hold the ETF. These features of ETFs (intraday tradability, transparency, tax efficiency, and access to specific markets or asset classes) have contributed to their growing popularity. ETFs also have gained favor due to the rising popularity of passive investments (discussed below), increasing use of asset allocation models, and a move toward external fee-based models of compensation. As a result, assets invested in the 2,096 ETFs in existence in 2019 totaled  \$4.4 trillion, up from\$ 66 billion invested in a total of 80 funds in 2000. Most ETFs are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are regulated by the SEC. Thus, they are subject to the same regulatory requirements as other mutual funds.

4. SPDRs, Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts, hold a portfolio of the equity securities that comprise the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. SPDRs seek investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Vanguard Large-Cap Index Participation Equity Receipts (VIPERs) seek to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large-capitalization stocks.

managers discretion to select individual securities, generally with the investment objective of outperforming a previously identified benchmark. In contrast, passive (or "index") strategies use rules-based investing to track an index, typically by holding all of its constituent assets or an automatically selected representative sample of those assets. What is clear from Figure 17-3 is that, the past couple of decades have seen a significant shift in assets from active to passive investment strategies. As of December 2019, passive funds accounted for 39 percent of combined U.S. mutual fund and ETF assets under management (AUM), up from four percent in 1996, and 15 percent in 2007. Several factors appear to have contributed to the active-to-passive shift. The development of the efficient markets hypothesis in the 1950s and 1960s called into question the role of active selection of securities to "beat the market" and indicated that investors should hold the market portfolio itself. The introduction of the first stock index funds in the 1970s made passive investments in the market portfolio a practical option for retail investors. The relatively lower costs associated with passive investing and evidence of underperformance of active managers have probably contributed, as well. Another factor is the growing popularity of ETFs, which are largely passive investment vehicles. Finally, greater regulatory focus on the fees of investment products may have encouraged the financial industry to offer low-cost, passive products to individual investors.

Generally, the price at which an ETF trades closely tracks the market value of the securities held in the portfolio. One reason for this fairly close relationship is the ability for authorized participants (APs) to create or redeem ETF shares at net asset value at the end of each trading day. An AP is typically a large financial institution that enters into a legal contract with an ETF distributor to create and redeem shares of the fund. APs are the only investors allowed to interact directly with the fund. Thus, they play a key role in the primary market for ETF shares. APs receive no compensation from the ETF distributor and have no legal obligation to create or redeem the ETF's shares. Rather, APs derive their compensation by acting as dealers in ETF shares. That is, APs stand ready to create and redeem shares in the primary market when doing so is a more effective way of managing their firms' aggregate exposure than trading in the secondary market. Creations and redemptions are processed through the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) and have the same guarantee as a domestic stock trade. Most ETFs do not create or redeem shares on many trading days. Rather than the creation and redemption of shares through an AP, investors trade shares in secondary markets. On average, daily aggregate ETF creations and redemptions are a fraction (10 percent) of their total primary market activity and secondary market trading, and account for less than 0.5 percent of the funds' total net assets.

# marked to market

Describes the prices on outstanding futures contracts that are adjusted each day to reflect current futures market conditions.

# net asset value (NAV)

The net asset value of a share in a mutual fund equal to the market value of the assets in the mutual fund portfolio divided by the number of shares outstanding.

# Investor Returns from Mutual Fund Ownership

The return for the investor from investing in mutual fund shares reflects three aspects of the underlying portfolio of mutual fund assets. First, the portfolio earns income and dividends on those assets. Second, capital gains occur when the mutual fund sells an asset at prices higher than the original purchase price of the asset. Third, the sale of additional mutual fund shares and the profitable investment made with the funds from these shares can produce a capital appreciation that adds to the value of all shares in the mutual fund. With respect to capital appreciation, mutual fund assets are normally marked to market daily. This means that the managers of the fund calculate the current value of each mutual fund share by computing the daily market value of the fund's total asset portfolio less any liabilities and then dividing this amount by the number of mutual fund shares outstanding. The resulting value is called the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's shares. This is the price that investors obtain when they sell shares back to the fund that day or the price they pay to buy new shares in the fund on that day. NAVs are published just once a day, after markets are closed.

LG 17-5

# EXAMPLE 17-1 Calculation of NAV of an Open-End Mutual Fund

Suppose today a mutual fund contains 4,000 shares of Foot Locker currently trading at \$22.00, 1,200 shares of ExxonMobil currently trading at \$77.00, and 1,500 shares of AT&T currently trading at 33.75. The mutual fund has no liabilities and 15,000 shares outstanding held by investors. Thus, today, the NAV of the fund's shares is calculated as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{NA V} = \frac{\text{To ta lm ar ke tv al ue of as se ts un de rm ag en em t}}{\text{Nu mb er of mu tu al fu nd shareso ut st an di ng}} \\ = (4, 0 0 0 \times \$ 2 2. 0 0 + 1, 2 0 0 \times \$ 7 7. 0 0 + 1, 5 0 0 \times \$ 3 3. 7 5) \div 1 5, 0 0 0 = \$ 1 5. 4 0 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

If tomorrow Foot Locker's shares increase to  \$26.50, ExxonMobil's shares increase to\$ 78, and AT&T's shares increase to 35, the NAV (assuming the number of shares outstanding remains the same) would increase to:

$$
\mathrm{NA V} = (4, 0 0 0 \times \ 2 6. 5 0 + 1, 2 0 0 \times \ 7 8 + 1, 5 0 0 \times \ 3 5) \div 1 5, 0 0 0 = \ 1 6. 8 0 7
$$

# EXAMPLE 17-2 Calculation of NAV of an Open-End Mutual Fund when the Number of Shares Increases

Consider the mutual fund in Example 17-1, but suppose that today 1,000 additional investors buy one share each of the mutual fund at the NAV of  \$15.402. This means that the fund manager has\$ 15,402 additional funds to invest. Suppose that the fund manager decides to use these additional funds to buy additional shares in Foot Locker. At today's market price, the manager could buy 700 additional shares ( $15,402/$ 22.00) of Foot Locker. Thus, its new portfolio of shares has 4,700 in Foot Locker, 1,200 in ExxonMobil, and 1,500 in AT&T. Given the same rise in share values as assumed in Example 17-1, tomorrow's NAV will now be:

$$
\mathrm{NA V} = (4, 7 0 0 \times 2 6. 5 0 + 1, 2 0 0 \times 7 8 + 1, 5 0 0 \times 3 5) \div 1 6, 0 0 0 = \$ 1 6. 9 1 6
$$ www.morningstar.com

Note that the fund's value changed over the day due to both capital appreciation and investment size. A comparison of the NAV in Example 17-1 with the one in this example indicates that the additional shares and the profitable investments made with the new funds from these shares resulted in a slightly higher NAV than had the number of shares remained static ( \$16.916 versus\$ 16.807).

Mutual fund investors can get information on the performance of mutual funds from several places. For example, for a comprehensive analysis of mutual funds, Morningstar, Inc. offers information on over 30,000 funds globally. Morningstar does not own, operate, or hold an interest in any mutual fund. Thus, it is recognized as a leading provider of unbiased data and performance analysis (e.g., returns) for the industry. Similarly, Lipper Fund Research from Refinitiv tracks the performance of more than 335,000 funds worldwide.

# Mutual Fund Costs

Mutual funds charge shareholders a price or fee for the services they provide (i.e., management of a diversified portfolio of financial securities). Two types of fees are incurred by investors: sales loads and fund operating expenses. The total cost to the shareholder of investing in a mutual fund is the sum of the annualized sales load and other fees charged. We discuss these next.

# load fund

A mutual fund with an up-front sales or commission charge that the investor must pay.

# no-load fund

A mutual fund that does not charge up-front sales or commission charges on the sale of mutual fund shares to investors.

Load versus No-Load Funds. An investor who buys a mutual fund share may be subject to a one-time sales or commission charge, sometimes as high as 5.75 percent. In this case, the fund is called a load fund. Funds that have no up-front sales or commission charges are called no-load funds.

The argument in favor of load funds is that they provide the investor with more personal attention and advice on fund selection than no-load funds. However, the cost of increased personal attention may not be worthwhile. High fees do not guarantee good performance. For example, Table 17-6 lists initial fees for the largest U.S. stock funds in May 2020. Notice that only American Funds assesses a load fee on mutual fund share purchases. After adjusting for this fee, the 1-year returns on 8 American Funds mutual funds fall from a range of  $-3.84$  percent to 13.32 percent to a range of  $-3.62$  percent to 12.55 percent. As Figure 17-4 indicates, investors increasingly recognized this cost disadvantage for load funds in the 1990s as stock market values increased broadly and dramatically. In 1985, load funds represented almost 70 percent of mutual fund sales and no-load funds represented just over 30 percent. By 1998 new sales of no-load mutual fund shares actually exceeded those of load fund shares and by the mid-2000s total assets invested in no-load funds far exceeded those invested in load funds. Of course, because the load fee is a one-time charge, it must be converted to an annualized charge incurred by the shareholder over the life of the investment. If the shareholder's investment horizon is long term, the annualized load fee can end up being quite small. If the investment horizon is short, however, the load fee can leave the shareholder with little profit.

The demand for no-load funds by mutual fund investors has not gone unnoticed. Many companies, particularly discount brokers, now offer mutual fund "supermarkets" through which investors can buy and sell the mutual fund shares offered by several different mutual fund sponsors. The most important feature of a fund "supermarket" is its nontransaction fee program, whereby an investor may purchase mutual funds with no transaction fees from a large number of fund companies. The broker is generally paid for services from the fund's 12b-1 fees (discussed below). The nontransaction fee fund offerings at a discount broker often number in the thousands, providing an investor the convenience of purchasing no-load funds from different families at a single location.

# 12b-1 fees

Fees relating to the distribution costs of mutual fund shares.

Fund Operating Expenses. In contrast to one-time up-front load charges on the initial investment in a mutual fund, annual fees are charged to cover fund-level expenses, calculated as a percentage of the fund assets. One type of fee (called a management fee) is charged to meet operating costs (such as administration and shareholder services). Management fees are generally the largest fee charged to mutual fund owners. In addition, mutual funds generally require a small percentage of investable funds—as a fee—to meet distribution expenses and shareholder servicing costs. These fees are known as 12b-1 fees after the SEC rule covering such charges. Distribution fees include fees paid for marketing and selling fund shares. The SEC does not limit the size of 12b-1 fees that funds may charge. However, under Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules, 12b-1 fees that are used to pay marketing and distribution expenses (as opposed to shareholder service expenses) cannot exceed 0.75 percent of a fund's average net assets per year. FINRA imposes an annual cap of 0.25 percent on shareholder service fees. Because these fees, charged to cover fund operating expenses, are paid out of the fund's assets, investors indirectly bear these expenses. These fees are generally expressed as a percentage of the average net assets invested in the fund.

Because the sales load is a one-time charge, it must be converted to an annualized payment incurred by the shareholder over the life of his or her investment. With this conversion, the total shareholder cost of investing in a fund is the sum of the annualized sales load plus any annual fees. For example, suppose an investor purchased funds shares with a 4 percent front-end load and expects to hold the shares for 10 years. The annualized sales load incurred by the investor is:

$$

4 \% / 10 \text{years} = 0.4 \% \text{peryear}

$$

Further, suppose the fund has a total fund expense ratio (including 12b-1 fees) of 1 percent per year. The annual total shareholder cost for this fund is calculated as:

$$
0.4\% +1\% = 1.4\% \text{peryear}
$$

Funds sold through financial professionals such as brokers have recently adopted alternative payment methods. These typically include an annual 12b-1 fee based on asset values that may also be combined with a front-end or back-end sales charge. In many cases, funds offer several different share classes (all of which invest in the same underlying portfolio of assets), but each share class may offer investors different methods of paying for broker services. In 2019, there were 24,593 share classes offered by 7,945 mutual funds, suggesting the average mutual fund had three share classes. In contrast, each mutual fund had only one share class in 1980. Most funds sold in multiple classes offer investors three payment plans through three share classes (A, B, and C), each having different mixes of sales loads and 12b-1 fees.

Class A shares represent the traditional means for paying for investment advice. That is, Class A shares carry a front-end load that is charged at the time of purchase as a percentage of the sales price. The front-end load on Class A shares is charged on new sales and is not generally incurred when Class A shares are exchanged for another mutual fund within the same fund family. In addition to the front-end load, Class A shares usually have an annual 12b-1 fee that is used to compensate brokers and sales professionals for ongoing assistance and service provided to fund shareholders. The 12b-1 fee for Class A shares is typically between 25 and 35 basis points of the portfolio's assets.


# EXAMPLE 17-3 Calculation of Mutual Fund Costs

The cost of mutual fund investing to the shareholder includes both the one-time sales load and any annual fees charged. Suppose an individual invests 10,000 in a load mutual fund. The load fee entails an up-front commission charge of 4 percent of the amount invested and is deducted from the original funds invested. Thus, the individual's actual investment, after the load fee is deducted, is:

$$

\$ 10,000(1 - 0.04) = \$ 9,600

$$

In addition, annual fund operating expenses are 0.85 percent (representing a management fee of 0.75 percent and a 12b-1 fee of 0.10 percent). The annual fees are charged on the average net asset value invested in the fund and are recorded at the end of each year. Investments in the fund return 5 percent each year paid on the last day of the year. If the investor reinvests the annual returns paid on the investment, after one year the operating fees deducted and the value of the investment are:

Annual operating expenses  $=$  Average net asset value  $\times$  Annual operating expenses

$$

= [ \$ 9, 6 0 0 + \$ 9, 6 0 0 (1. 0 5) ] / 2 \times 0. 0 0 8 5 = \$ 8 3. 6 4 0

$$

Value of investment at end of year  $1 = \$  9,600(1.05) - \ $83.640 = \$  9,996.360\$

The investor's return on the mutual fund investment after one year is:

$$

(\$ 9,996.360 - \$ 10,000) / \$ 10,000 = -0.04 \%

$$

In year 2, the investor's fees deducted and investment value at the end of the year are:

Annual operating expenses =  $[\9,996.360 + \$ 9,996.360(1.05)] / 2 \times 0.0085 = \$87.093

Value of investment at end of year 2 = $9,996.360(1.05) - $87.093 = 10,409.085

After two years the investor has paid a total of  \$400 in load fees and\$ 170.733 in operating expenses, and he has made \$409.085 above the original \$10,000 investment. The investor's annual return on the mutual fund is 2.02 percent.[7]

4. What the three largest mutual fund companies are? How have their funds performed in recent years?
5. What the difference is between an open-end mutual fund and a closed-end fund?

Unlike Class A shares, Class B shares are offered for sale at the NAV without a front-end load. Class B share investors pay for advice and assistance from brokers through a combination of annual 12b-1 fees (usually 1 percent) and a back-end load. The back-end load is charged when shares are redeemed (sold) and is typically based on the lesser of the original cost of the shares or the market value at the time of sale. After six to eight years, Class B shares typically convert to Class A shares, lowering the level of the annual 12b-1 fees from 1 percent to that of A shares.

Class C shares are offered at the NAV with no front-end load, and typically recover distribution costs through a combination of annual 12b-1 fees of 1 percent and a back-end load, set at 1 percent in the first year of purchase. After the first year no back-end load is charged on redemption. The Class C shares usually do not convert to Class A shares, and thus the annual 1 percent payment to the broker continues throughout the period of time that the shares are held.

7. That is, $10,000 = $10,409.085/(1 + i)² = > i = 2.02\%.

There are several other mutual fund share classes, with designations like I, R, N, X and Y. These are what are known as Institutional shares. Mutual funds usually make these classes available only to those with high net worth, typically more than  \$1 million, or to institutional investors who can make seven-figure deposits. However, 401(k) plans and other employer-sponsored retirement plans count as such institutional investors; by pooling the employees contributions, the plan administrator is able to qualify for this class of shares. This is highly desirable: Institutional shares usually carry the lowest fees and expenses of mutual fund share classes. Because of the low expense ratios, institutional class shares invariably garner the best returns. For example, Vanguard offers three share classes. Investor shares demand$ 1,000 to $3,000 initial deposits and carry an average expense ratio of 0.18 percent. Admiral shares have $3,000, $50,000 or \$100,000 minimums, but the expense ratio averages 0.11 percent. Finally, the Institutional shares begin at 5 million, and their average expense ratio is 0.05 percent.

As discussed below, the lack of complete disclosure and the inability of most mutual fund investors to understand the different fees charged for various classes of mutual fund shares came under scrutiny in the early 2000s. Indeed, the potential for overcharging fees to various classes of mutual fund shareholders led the SEC to create new rules pertaining to these charges (see below). Possibly as a result of these scandals and new rules, more than 850 mutual funds decreased their management fees in 2005 and over 700 lowered their fees in 2006. Increased competition from ETFs and closed-end funds, which are less costly than open-end mutual funds and do not include sales charges, is another reason for the continued drop in mutual fund fees. The average fees and expenses paid by mutual fund investors continue to fall. Investors paid 0.74 percent on average for actively managed equity mutual funds in 2019, down from 1.06 percent in 2000. Expense ratios for actively managed bond funds fell to 0.56 percent in 2019 from 0.79 percent in 2000. Expense ratios for index funds and index ETFs are falling as well, despite being much lower to begin with (see Figure 17-5).

Fidelity, BlackRock, and Vanguard Group are dueling to win investors by offering commission-free ETFs and slashing fees on other funds. Fidelity's new zero-fee funds, first introduced in August 2018, had net asset flows  \$2.9 billion through the end of 2018. In July 2019, the least expensive new share class of the BlackRock's iShares S&P 500 Index Fund dropped to\$ 1.25 for every \$10,000, down from \$4.00. To qualify, investors have to invest at least 2.5 billion. That is the lowest price ever offered for any BlackRock index mutual fund and a fraction of a basis point above what large investors pay rival Vanguard Group for similar fund. While lower expense ratios are good, investors will need to remember that expense-free does not mean risk-free. Plus, management fees aren't the only cost of owning a fund. Trading and taxes can crimp returns..

# MUTUAL FUND BALANCE SHEETS AND RECENT TRENDS

# Long-Term Funds

Note the asset distribution of long-term mutual funds in Table 17-8. As might be expected, the distribution of assets reflects the relative popularity of bonds and equities at various times. Underscoring the attractiveness of equities in 2007 was the fact that corporate equities represented 70.0 percent of total long-term mutual fund asset portfolios, while credit market instruments were the next most popular asset (28.1 percent of the asset portfolio). In contrast, consider the distribution of assets in 2008 when the equity markets were plummeting and the economy was in recession. Corporate equities made up only 55.5 percent of long-term mutual fund portfolios, and credit market instruments were 41.9 percent of total assets. Note too that total financial assets fell from  \$7,829.0 billion in 2007 (before the start of the financial crisis) to just\$ 5,435.3 billion in 2008 (at the height of the crisis), a drop of 30.6 percent. As the economy and financial markets recovered, financial assets held by long-term mutual funds increased to 7,873.0 billion in 2010, of which only 60.5 percent were corporate equities. By 2019, while total assets had far surpassed pre-crisis levels, only

67.3 percent was invested in corporate equities. Thus, even 11 years after the start of the financial crisis, long-term funds had not switched their holdings of corporate equities back to their pre-crisis levels.

# Money Market Funds

Look at the distribution of assets of money market mutual funds from 1990 through 2019 in Table 17-9. In 2019,  \$3,471.3 billion (95.5 percent of total assets) were invested in short-term (under one year to maturity) financial securities—such as foreign deposits, domestic checkable deposits and currency, time and savings deposits, repurchase agreements (RPs or repos), open-market paper (mostly commercial paper), and U.S. government securities. This is up from 2007 (at the start of the financial crisis) when\$ 2,094.3 billion (or 69.0 percent) of financial assets were invested in short-term securities. As financial markets tumbled in 2008, money market mutual funds moved investments out of corporate and foreign bonds (12.4 percent of the total in 2007 and 6.1 percent in 2008) into safer securities such as U.S. government securities (13.6 percent of the total investments in 2007 and 35.5 percent in 2008). Short-term maturity asset holdings reflect the objective of these funds to retain the depositlike nature of the share liabilities they issue. In fact, most customer-oriented money market mutual fund shares have their values fixed at \$1. The principal type of risk for short-term funds is interest rate risk, because of the predominance of fixed-income securities. Because of the shortness of maturity of the assets, this risk is mitigated to a large extent. Further, asset value fluctuations due to interest rate changes and any small default risk and capital gains or losses are adjusted by increasing or reducing the number of \$1 shares owned by the investor.

6. What major assets have been held by mutual funds in the 1990s-2010s?
7. How the asset distribution for money market mutual funds and long-term mutual funds differs?

In addition to these typical risks faced by fund managers, money market mutual funds experienced unusual liquidity risk at the start of the financial crisis. On September 16, 2008 (one day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy), Primary Reserve Fund, the oldest money market fund in the United States, saw its shares fall to an equivalent of 97 cents (below the  \$1.00 book value) after writing off debt issued by Lehman Brothers. Resulting investor anxiety about Primary Reserve Fund spread to other funds and investors industrywide liquidated their MMMF shares. In just one week investors liquidated over\$ 200 billion of the industry's total of \$4 trillion invested in MMMFs. In response, on September 19, 2008, the federal government took steps to restore confidence in the MMMF industry. Specifically, the Department of Treasury opened the Temporary Guarantee Program for MMMFs, which provided up to \$50 billion in coverage to MMMF shareholders for amounts they held in the funds as of the close of business that day. The guarantee was triggered if a participating fund's net asset value fell below 0.995. The program was designed to address the severe liquidity strains in the industry and immediately stabilized the industry and stopped the outflows. As a consequence of this unprecedented turn of events, in 2016 regulators adopted new rules under which the net asset values of MMMF shares issued by institutional prime money market funds would float as the value of the underlying investments changed. A floating NAV would mean money market funds would behave more like short-term bond funds, with share prices rising and falling with changing market conditions.

# EXAMPLE 17-4 Calculation of Number of Shares Outstanding in a Money Market Mutual Fund

Because of a drop in interest rates, the market value of the assets held by a particular MMMF increases from  $100 to$ 110. The market value balance sheet for the mutual fund before and after the drop in interest rates is:

(a) Before interest rate drop:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Market value of
MMMFA assets</td><td>100</td><td>Market value of MMMF fund shares (100 shares × $1)</td><td>$100</td></tr></table>

(b) After interest rate drop:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Market value of
MMMFA assets</td><td>110</td><td>Market value of MMMF fund shares (110 shares × $1)</td><td>$110</td></tr></table>

The interest rate drop results in 10 (110 - 100) new equity-type shares that are held by investors in the MMMF, reflecting the increase in the market value of the MMMF's assets of  \$10 (i.e., 10 new shares of\$ 1 each).

# MUTUAL FUND REGULATION

# LG 17-6

Because mutual funds manage and invest small investor savings, this industry is heavily regulated. Indeed, many regulations have been enacted to protect investors against possible abuses by mutual fund managers. The SEC is the primary regulator of mutual funds. Specifically, the Securities Act of 1933 requires a mutual fund to file a registration statement with the SEC and sets rules and procedures regarding a fund's prospectus that it sends to investors. In addition, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes the purchase and sale of mutual fund shares subject to various antifraud provisions. This act requires mutual funds to furnish full and accurate information on all financial and corporate matters to prospective fund purchasers. The 1934 act also appointed the National Association of Securities Dealers

(NASD) to supervise mutual fund share distributions. In 1940, Congress passed the Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act established rules to prevent conflicts of interest, fraud, and excessive fees or charges for fund shares.

More recently, the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 required mutual funds to develop mechanisms and procedures to avoid insider trading abuses. In addition, the Market Reform Act of 1990, passed in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, allows the SEC to introduce circuit breakers to halt trading on exchanges and to restrict program trading when it is deemed necessary. Finally, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) of 1996 (discussed in Chapter 16) also applies to mutual fund companies. Specifically, the NSMIA exempts mutual fund companies from oversight by state securities regulators, thus reducing their regulatory burden.

Despite the many regulations imposed on mutual fund companies, several allegations of trading abuse and the improper assignment of fees were revealed and prosecuted in the early 2000s. The abusive activities fell into four general categories: market timing, late trading, directed brokerage, and improper assessment of fees.

Market timing is short-term trading of mutual funds that seeks to take advantage of short-term discrepancies between the price of a mutual fund's shares and out-of-date values on the securities in the fund's portfolio. It is especially common in international funds, where traders can exploit differences in time zones. Late trading allegations have involved cases in which some investors were able to buy or sell mutual fund shares long after the price had been set at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time each day (i.e., after the close of the NYSE and NASDAQ). Directed brokerage arrangements between mutual fund companies and brokerage houses afforded brokers the opportunity to improperly influence investors on their funds recommendations. For example, some mutual fund companies agreed to direct orders for stock and bond purchases and sales to brokerage houses that agreed to promote sales of the mutual fund company's products. Finally, the disclosure of 12b-1 fees allowed brokers to improperly assess fees by tricking investors into believing they were buying no-load funds. Before 12b-1 fees, all funds sold through brokers carried front-end load fees. As discussed earlier, with 12b-1 fees, fund companies introduced share classes, some of which carried back-end loads that declined over time and others which charged annual fees of up to 1 percent of asset values. Fund classes that charged annual 12b-1 fees would see performance decrease by that amount and thus not perform as well as an identical fund that carried a lower 12b-1 fee. The shareholder, however, saw only the fund's raw return (before annual fees) and not the dollar amount of the fee paid.

As a result of these illegal and abusive activities, rules and regulations were imposed (in 2004 and 2005) on mutual fund companies. The rules were intended to give investors more information about conflicts of interest, improve fund governance, and close legal loopholes that some fund managers had abused. The SEC also took steps to close a loophole that allowed improper trading to go unnoticed at some mutual funds. Prior to the new rules, the SEC required that funds report trading by senior employees in individual stocks but not in shares of mutual funds they manage. The SEC now requires portfolio managers to report trading in funds they manage. To address the problem of market timing, the SEC now requires funds to provide expanded disclosure of the risks of frequent trading in fund shares and of their policies and procedures regarding such activities. Mutual funds also now have to be more open about their use of fair value pricing (a practice of estimating the value of rarely traded securities or updating the values of non-U.S. securities that last traded many hours before U.S. funds calculate their share prices each day) to guard against stale share prices that could produce profits for market timers. The SEC has also proposed that mutual funds or their agents receive all trading orders by 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, when the fund's daily price is calculated. This "hard closing," which would require fund orders to be in the hands of the mutual fund companies by 4:00 p.m., is intended to halt late trading abuses.

To ensure that the required rule changes took place, starting October 5, 2004, the SEC required that mutual funds hire chief compliance officers to monitor whether a mutual fund company is following the rules. The chief compliance officer reports directly to mutual fund directors, and not to executives of the fund management company. To further insulate the chief compliance officer from being bullied into keeping quiet about improper behavior, only the fund board can fire the compliance officer. Duties of the compliance officer include policing personal trading by fund managers, ensuring the accuracy of information provided to regulators and investors, reviewing fund business practices such as allocating trading commissions, and reporting any wrongdoing directly to fund directors.


New SEC rules also called for shareholder reports to include the fees shareholders paid, as well as management's discussion of the fund's performance over that period. As of September 1, 2004, mutual fund companies must provide clear information to investors on brokerage commissions and discounts, including improved disclosure on up-front sales charges for broker-sold mutual funds. Investors now get a document showing the amount they paid for a fund, the amount their broker was paid, and how the fund compares with industry averages based on fees, sales loads, and brokerage commissions. Finally, in March 2009, the SEC adopted amendments to the form used by mutual funds to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and to offer their securities under the Securities Act of 1933 in order to enhance the disclosures that are provided to mutual fund investors. The amendments (first proposed in November 2007) require key information to appear in plain English in a standardized order at the front of the mutual fund statutory prospectus. The new amendment also includes a new option for satisfying prospectus delivery obligations with respect to mutual fund securities under the Securities Act. Under the option, key information is sent or given to investors in the form of a summary prospectus and the statutory prospectus is provided on an Internet website. The improved disclosure framework is intended to provide investors with information that is easier to use and more readily accessible, while retaining the comprehensive quality of the information that was previously available.

After the financial crisis, the SEC adopted new regulations for money market funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC tightened the risk-limiting conditions of Rule 2a-7 by strengthening the investment parameters and mitigating the risks associated with each fund's investments. With the ultimate goal of protecting investors, the reforms impacted the credit quality, liquidity guidelines, diversification parameters, and portfolio securities disclosure of money market funds. For example, liquidity requirements under the 2010 amendments included: (i) no more than 5 percent of the fund's total assets must be illiquid securities, (ii) a minimum of 10 percent of total assets must be daily liquid securities, and (iii) a minimum of 30 percent of total assets must be weekly liquid assets. Although these reforms improved resiliency of money market funds the SEC said at the time that it would continue to consider whether further, more fundamental changes to money market fund regulation might be warranted.

In a February 2013 letter sent to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) (set up as a result of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to oversee the financial system), the leaders of all 12 regional Federal Reserve banks called for a significant overhaul of the money market industry. The letter stated that, even four years after the financial crisis, without reform, money market mutual fund activities could spread the risk of significant credit problems from the funds to banks and the broader financial system. New York Fed President William Dudley stated that the risk of a run on money market funds was potentially higher in 2013 than before the crisis because banks increasingly used these funds as a source of financing and because Congress blocked the Fed and Treasury from using certain emergency tools that could stabilize the funds during a market panic. As a result of the calls for reform, in July 2014, the SEC adopted further amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds (Rule 2a-7). The money market mutual fund industry had to comply with the new regulations by October 16, 2016. The amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of investor runs in money market funds, while preserving the benefits of the funds. The new rules require a floating net asset value (NAV) for institutional prime money market funds. Floating NAV allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market value of fund assets. Further, liquidity fees and redemption gates were instituted, giving money market fund boards the ability to impose fees and gates during periods of stress to address runs. The final rules also include enhanced diversification and disclosure and stress testing requirements, as well as updated reporting by money market funds and private funds that operate like money market funds.


The potential impact of money market reform generated a lot of market chatter beginning in early 2015. Market observers anticipated significant changes in the industry, a potentially large shift from prime institutional funds, which then had about \$1 trillion in assets, to government funds. In reality, the magnitude of the shift from prime to government funds were larger than originally expected. In the middle of 2016, just a few months before the October implementation date, one survey estimated that \$400 billion would shift from prime to government funds. Ultimately, about a trillion dollars shifted from prime to government funds (Figure 17-6). This meant that banks that had routinely sold commercial paper to prime funds had to make some difficult choices: they could try to find new buyers for their paper, they could try to find new sources of funding, or they could shrink. This was quite a lot of change for the market to absorb. An important part of the adjustment of the market came through the Federal Home Loan Banks. These are U.S. government-sponsored entities that make collateralized loans to banks, called advances. The Federal Home Loan Banks fund themselves by issuing debt securities. Because they are government-sponsored entities (GSEs), government money market funds can buy these securities. So, the Federal Home Loan Banks were in a position to solve two of the key challenges created by the money market mutual fund reform: higher demand for government securities and banks' need to replace commercial paper.

Also, in 2015 the SEC proposed rules and amendments to modernize and enhance the reporting and disclosure of information by investment companies and investment advisors. The new rules would enhance the quality of information available to investors and would allow the commission to more effectively collect and use data provided by investment companies and investment advisors. The SEC also proposed a comprehensive package of rule reforms

designed to enhance effective liquidity risk management by open-end funds, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Under the proposed reforms, mutual funds and ETFs would be required to implement liquidity risk management programs and enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices. The proposal is designed to better ensure that investors can redeem their shares and receive their assets in a timely manner. A fund's liquidity risk management program would be required to contain multiple elements, including classification of the liquidity of fund portfolio assets based on the amount of time an asset would be able to be converted to cash without a market impact; assessment, periodic review, and management of a fund's liquidity risk; establishment of a fund's three-day liquid asset minimum; and board approval and review.

As discussed throughout the chapter, mutual funds have been the fastest-growing sector in the U.S. financial institutions industry throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Only the worldwide financial crisis and the worst worldwide recession since the Great Depression curtailed the growth in this industry. Worldwide investment in mutual funds is shown in Table 17-10. Combined assets invested in non-U.S. mutual funds are approximately 13.6 percent greater than that invested in U.S. mutual funds alone. However, recent growth in non-U.S. funds has exceeded that in U.S. funds. Worldwide (other than in the United States) investments in mutual funds increased over 187 percent, from  \$4.916 trillion in 1999 to\$ 14.130 trillion in 2007. This compares to growth of 75 percent in U.S. funds. Likewise, non-U.S. mutual funds experienced bigger losses in total assets during the financial crisis. Worldwide funds fell to  \$9.316 trillion (34.1 percent) in 2008, while U.S. funds fell to\$ 9.603 trillion (20.0 percent). By 2019, as worldwide economies improved, non-U.S. investments in mutual funds increased to \$29.19 trillion (an increase of 213 percent from 2008), while U.S. investments increased to \$25.68 trillion (an increase of 167 percent). In addition, as this industry developed in countries throughout the world, the number of mutual funds worldwide (other than in the United States) increased by 158 percent, from 43,537 in 2000 to 112,487 in 2019. Much more established in the United States, the number of mutual funds increased by 23 percent over this period.

As may be expected, the worldwide mutual fund market is most active in those countries with the most sophisticated securities markets (e.g., Japan, France, Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom). Note that the large value of mutual funds in Luxembourg is a result of the country's introduction of legislation in 1988 that gave fund managers maximum freedom in their fund's management. The legislation let managers make virtually any investments they want to (including investments in options, futures, and venture capital) as long as they were clear enough about their intentions with investors. In addition, Luxembourg had an infrastructure of lawyers, accountants, banks, and computer technicians that made it an easy place to operate mutual funds.

Although U.S. mutual fund companies sponsor funds abroad, barriers to entry overseas are typically higher than in the United States. The U.S. mutual fund industry has worked to lower the barriers that prevent U.S. mutual fund firms from marketing their services abroad more widely and to improve competition in the often diverse fund markets around the world. The U.S. mutual fund industry has, for example, worked to achieve a true cross-border market for mutual fund companies in Europe and to ensure that publicly offered mutual fund companies can be used as funding vehicles in the retirement fund market in Europe and Japan. The industry has also sought to reduce barriers for U.S. mutual fund sponsors seeking to offer mutual fund company products in China and other Asian countries.

# HEDGE FUNDS

LG 17-8

Hedge funds are investment pools that invest funds for (wealthy) individuals and other investors (e.g., commercial banks). They are similar to mutual funds in that they are pooled investment vehicles that accept investors' money and generally invest it on a collective basis. Hedge funds, however, are not subject to the numerous regulations that apply to mutual funds for the protection of individuals, such as regulations requiring a certain degree of liquidity, regulations requiring that mutual fund shares be redeemable at any time, regulations protecting against conflicts of interest, regulations to ensure fairness in the pricing of funds shares, disclosure regulations, and regulations limiting the use of leverage. Further, hedge funds do not have to disclose their activities to third parties. Thus, they offer a high degree of privacy for their investors. Until 2010, hedge funds were not required to register with the SEC. Thus, they were subject to virtually no regulatory oversight (e.g., by the SEC under the Securities Act and Investment Advisers Act) and generally took significant risk. Even after 2010, hedge funds offered in the United States avoid regulations by limiting the asset size of the fund (see below).

Historically, hedge funds have avoided regulations by limiting the number of investors to less than 100 individuals (below that required for SEC registration), who must be deemed "accredited investors." To be accredited, an investor must have a net worth of over  \$1 million or have an annual income of at least$ 200,000 ($300,000 if married). Institutional investors can be qualified as accredited investors if total assets exceed \$5 million. These stiff financial requirements allowed hedge funds to avoid regulation under the theory that individuals with such wealth should be able to evaluate the risk and return on their investments. According to the SEC, these types of investors should be expected to make more informed decisions and take on higher levels of risk. However, as a result of some heavily publicized hedge fund failures and near failures—the result of fraud by fund managers (e.g., Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities,) and the financial crisis (e.g., Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund)—in 2010 federal regulators increased the oversight of hedge funds.

Because hedge funds have been exempt from many of the rules and regulations governing mutual funds, they can use aggressive strategies that are unavailable to mutual funds, including short selling, leveraging, program trading, arbitrage, and derivatives trading. Further, since hedge funds that do not exceed  \$100 million in assets under management do not register with the SEC, their actual data cannot be independently tracked. Therefore, hedge fund data are self-reported. It is estimated that in 2019, there were over 9,400 hedge funds in the United States, with assets of\$ 3.32 trillion. Table 17-11 lists the estimated 10 largest hedge fund firms by total assets managed in 2019.

Hedge funds grew in popularity in the 1990s as investors saw returns of over 40 percent after management fees (often more than 25 percent of the fund's profits). They came to the forefront of the news in the late 1990s when one large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital

Management (LTCM), nearly collapsed. The near collapse of LTCM not only hurt its investors, but arguably came close to damaging the world's financial system. So great was the potential impact of the failure of LTCM that the Federal Reserve felt it was necessary to intervene by brokering a 3.6 billion bailout of LTCM by a consortium of some of the world's largest financial institutions.

Some hedge funds take positions (using sophisticated computer models) speculating that some prices will rise faster than others. For example, a hedge fund may buy (take a long position in) a bond expecting that its price will rise. At the same time the fund will borrow (taking a short position) in another bond and sell it, promising to return the borrowed bond in the future. Generally, bond prices tend to move up and down together. Thus, if prices go up as expected, the hedge fund will gain on the bond it purchased while losing money on the bond it borrowed. The hedge fund will make a profit if the gain on the bond it purchased is larger than the loss on the bond it borrowed. If, contrary to expectations, bond prices fall, the hedge fund will make a profit if the gains on the bond it borrowed are greater than the losses on the bond it bought. Thus, regardless of the change in prices, the simultaneous long and short positions in bonds will minimize the risk of overall losses for the hedge fund.

# Types of Hedge Funds

Most hedge funds are highly specialized, relying on the specific expertise of the fund managers to produce a profit. Hedge fund managers follow a variety of investment strategies. Some of these strategies use leverage and derivatives, while others are more conservative and involve little or no leverage. Generally, hedge funds are set up with specific parameters so that investors can forecast a risk-return profile. Figure 17-7 shows the general categories of hedge funds by risk classification.

More risky funds are the most aggressive and may produce profits in many types of market environments. Funds in this group are classified by objectives such as aggressive growth, emerging markets, macro, market timing, and short selling. Aggressive growth funds invest in equities expected to experience acceleration in growth of earnings per share. Generally, high price-to-earnings ratio, low or no dividend companies are included. These funds hedge by shorting equities where earnings disappointment is expected or by shorting stock indexes. Emerging market funds invest in equity or debt securities of emerging markets, which tend to have higher inflation and volatile growth. Macro funds aim to profit from changes in global economies, typically brought about by shifts in government policy that impact interest rates. These funds include investments in equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities. They use leverage and derivatives to accentuate the impact of market moves. Market timing funds allocate assets among different asset classes depending on the manager's view of the economic or market outlook. Thus, portfolio emphasis may swing widely between asset classes. The unpredictability of market movements and the difficulty of timing entry and exit from markets add significant risk to this strategy. Short-selling funds sell securities in anticipation of being able to buy them back in the future at a lower price based on the manager's assessment of the overvaluation of the securities or in anticipation of earnings disappointments.

Figure 17-7 Classification of Hedge Funds


Moderate risk funds are more traditional funds, similar to mutual funds, with only a portion of the portfolio being hedged. Funds in this group are classified by objectives such as distressed securities, fund of funds, opportunistic, multistrategy, and special situations. Distressed securities funds buy equity, debt, or trade claims, at deep discounts, of companies in or facing bankruptcy or reorganization. Profit opportunities come from the market's lack of understanding of the true value of these deep-discount securities and from the fact that the majority of institutional investors cannot own below-investment-grade securities. Funds of funds mix hedge funds and other pooled investment vehicles. This blending of different strategies and asset classes aims to provide a more stable long-term investment return than any of the individual funds. Returns and risk can be controlled by the mix of underlying strategies and funds. Capital preservation is generally an important consideration for these funds. Opportunistic funds change their investment strategy as opportunities arise to profit from events such as IPOs, sudden price changes resulting from a disappointing earnings announcement, and hostile takeover bids. These funds may utilize several investing styles at any point in time and are not restricted to any particular investment approach or asset class. Multistrategy funds take a diversified investment approach by implementing various strategies simultaneously to realize short- and long-term gains. This style of investment allows the manager to overweight or underweight different strategies to best capitalize on current investment opportunities. Special-situation funds invest in event-driven situations such as mergers, hostile takeovers, reorganizations, or leveraged buyouts. These funds may undertake the simultaneous purchase of stock in a company being acquired and sale of stock in its bidder, hoping to profit from the spread between the current market price and the final purchase price of the company.

Risk-avoidance funds are also more traditional funds, emphasizing consistent but moderate returns while avoiding risk. Funds in this group are classified by objectives such as income, market neutral-arbitrage, market neutral-securities hedging, and value. Income funds invest with the primary focus on yield or current income rather than solely on capital gains. These funds use leverage to buy bonds and some fixed-income derivatives, profiting from principal appreciation and interest income. Market neutral-arbitrage funds attempt to hedge market risk by taking offsetting positions, often in different securities of the same issuer, for example, long convertible bonds and short the firm's equity. Their focus is on obtaining returns with low or no correlation to both equity and bond markets. Market neutral-securities hedge funds invest equally in long and short equity portfolios in particular market sectors. Market risk is reduced, but effective stock analysis is critical to obtaining a profit. These funds use leverage to magnify their returns. They also sometimes use market index futures to hedge systematic risk. Value funds invest in securities perceived to be selling at deep discounts relative to their intrinsic values. Securities include those that may be out of favor or underfollowed by analysts.

Using traditional risk-adjusted measures of performance (such as Sharpe ratios), the performance of hedge funds has been very strong compared to that of traditional financial investments like stocks and bonds. Many hedge funds posted strong returns during the early 2000s even as stock returns were plummeting. A few hedge funds even performed well during the financial crisis. Table 17-12 lists the top hedge fund managers and their hedge fund company by 2009 earnings. The average hedge fund lost 15.7 percent in 2008, the worst performance on record. Nearly three-quarters of all hedge funds experienced losses. Nevertheless, many funds outperformed many of the underlying markets such as the S&P 500 Index. Note that two of the hedge funds listed in Table 17-12 earned positive 9. However, data deficiencies in the reporting and collection of hedge fund returns somewhat reduce confidence in all measures of hedge fund performance. Further, the inability to explain returns of individual hedge funds with standard multifactor risk models leaves open the possibility that it is not possible to properly measure the risk associated with at least some hedge fund strategies. If so, risk-adjusted returns earned by hedge funds may be overstated.

Indeed, only two of the listed hedge funds performed worse during the beginning of the financial crisis than the S&P 500 Index. Performance improved significantly in 2009, with the average fund earning over 20 percent for the year, the highest level since 2003 and the second best return in 10 years. However, the 2009 return on the S&P 500 Index was 26.46 percent. Note that while mutual fund performance is generally measured by returns relative to some benchmark (and therefore can perform "well" even by losing 10 percent if the benchmark loses 10.5 percent), performance of hedge funds is measured by the growth in total assets managed. Assets under management in the hedge fund industry fell by nearly 30 percent (to 1.5 trillion) in 2008. The decline was the largest on record and was attributed to a combination of negative performance, a surge in redemptions, and the liquidation of funds.

Hedge fund performance continued to lag into the 2010s. According to Hedge Fund Research, hedge funds have made 3.4 percent per year on average from 2010 to 2018, compared with 6.4 percent from 2000 to 2010 and 18.3 percent from 1989 to 2000. In 2019, Hedge Fund Research's Fund Weighted Composite Index (FWC) index was up 10.4 percent, the highest since 2009 when the index returned 20.0 percent. While 10.4 percent is the best return for hedge funds in a decade, it is still well below 31.5 percent that S&P 500 index returned in 2019. As discussed later, hedge funds generally charge fees of 2 percent of the money they manage (compared to 1 percent for mutual funds) whether the fund makes money or not. Further, managers may take up to 20 percent of any profit the hedge fund earns. With lackluster performance as seen in recent these years, the question for the industry is whether investors will start to lose faith in hedge funds and start liquidating their sizable investments in these funds. Table 17-13 lists some of the top performing hedge funds for 2019.

Over 1990 to 2019 period, only years with negative net asset flows for the hedge fund industry were 2008, 2009, 2016, 2018, and 2019. While outflows in 2018 were smaller than those in 2008, 2009 and 2016, outflows in 2018 reached  \$38 billion. Outflows in 2019 were\$ 43 billion. In addition to shrinking assets, fund launches fell to their lowest level since 2000. Just 480 hedge funds debuted in 2019, compared to 561 in 2018. According to Hedge Fund Research, more than 4,200 hedge funds were liquidated since the beginning of 2015 (see Figure 17-8). The share of total hedge fund assets coming from public and private sector pension funds, endowments, foundations, and insurance companies has slipped from 71 percent to 67 percent since 2015, according to data from the Alternative Investment Management Association, a London-based body. Given the weak returns, hedge-fund marketers have largely abandoned their strategy of pitching themselves as "absolute return" investments that perform well in both strong and weak stock markets. Now, at a time of low and rising interest rates, they're describing themselves as more attractive than fixed-income assets like bonds, which have traditionally provided a haven when investors thought stocks were overvalued. But bonds and bond funds tend to have much lower fees.

Despite their name, hedge funds do not always "hedge" their investments to protect the fund and its investors against market price declines and other risks. For example, the failures of two of Bear Stearns's hedge funds (Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Fund and Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund) were the result of managers' failure to accurately predict how the subprime bond market would behave under extreme circumstances. The market moved against them and their investors lost 1.6 billion when the funds, heavily invested in mortgage securities, collapsed in the summer of 2007. The failures were the first sign of the upcoming financial crisis that would eventually cripple financial markets and the overall economy.

The strategy employed by the Bear Stearns funds was quite simple. Specifically, the funds purchased collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that paid an interest rate over and above the cost of borrowing. Thus, every incremental unit of leverage added to the hedge funds' total expected return. To capitalize on this, fund managers used as much leverage as they could raise. Because the use of leverage increased the portfolio's exposure, fund managers purchased insurance on movements in credit markets. These insurance instruments, called credit default swaps, are designed to cover losses during times when credit concerns could cause bonds to fall in value, effectively hedging away some of the risk. In instances when credit markets (or the underlying bonds' prices) remain relatively stable, or even when they behave in line with historically based expectations, this strategy generates consistent, positive returns with very little deviation.

Unfortunately, as the problems with subprime debt began to unravel, the subprime mortgage-backed securities market behaved well outside of what the portfolio managers expected. This started a chain of events that imploded the fund. The subprime mortgage market began to see substantial increases in delinquencies from homeowners, which caused sharp decreases in the market values of these types of bonds. Since the Bear Stearns hedge fund managers failed to expect these sorts of extreme price movements, they also failed to purchase sufficient credit insurance to protect against these losses. Because they had leveraged their positions substantially, the funds began to experience large losses. The large losses made the creditors who provided the debt financing uneasy. The lenders required Bear Stearns to provide additional cash on their loans because the collateral (subprime bonds) was rapidly falling in value. However, the funds had no cash holdings. Thus, fund managers needed to sell bonds in order to generate cash. Quickly, it became public knowledge that Bear Stearns was in trouble, and competing funds moved to drive the prices of subprime bonds even lower to force Bear Stearns into an asset fire-sale. As prices on bonds fell, the funds experienced losses, which caused them to sell more bonds, which lowered the prices of the bonds even more, which caused the funds to sell more bonds, and so on. It did not take long before the funds had experienced a complete loss of capital.

# Fees on Hedge Funds

Hedge fund managers generally charge two types of fees: management fees and performance fees. As with mutual funds, the management fee is computed as a percentage of the total assets under management and typically runs between 1.5 and 2.0 percent. Performance fees are unique to hedge funds. Performance fees give the fund manager a share of any positive returns on a hedge fund. The average performance fee on hedge funds is approximately 20 percent but varies widely. For example, Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management charges a performance fee of 10 to 30 percent. Table 17-14 lists the top 10 earnings figures for hedge fund managers in 2019. Performance fees are paid to the hedge fund manager before returns are paid to the fund investors. Hedge funds often specify a hurdle rate, which is a minimum annualized performance benchmark that must be realized before a performance fee can be assessed. Further, a high-water mark is usually used for hedge funds in which the manager does not receive a performance fee unless the value of

High-water marks are used to link the fund manager's incentives more closely to those of the fund investors and to reduce the manager's incentive to increase the risk of trades.

Given hedge funds' recent record of low returns, fees are one of the key issues affecting the industry today. Investors are increasingly dissatisfied with fees and consequently pushing for more favorable arrangements. This discontent has resulted in the rejection of managers and withdrawal of funds altogether. For example, in 2014 CalPERS liquidated its entire hedge fund portfolio (4 billion) in an effort to cut back on fees. As a result, the standard 2/20 fee model is slowly giving way to new structures (see Figure 17-9). Rather than simply lowering fees, many hedge funds have adopted new structures altogether. For example, Adage Capital Management changed to a flat 0.5 percent management fee and 20 percent performance fee on trading gains or losses in excess of the S&P 500. If the fund's performance falls below the S&P 500 benchmark, it refunds up to half of those fees to investors. Investors reacted positively to this change as the fund doubled in size in the four years after the change. Other fee structure changes have included a hurdle rate requiring a minimum net return to be generated before the manager is allowed to collect performance fees. The hurdle rate is often tied to a benchmark rate, such as the S&P 500.

# Offshore Hedge Funds

Hedge funds that are organized in the United States are designated as domestic hedge funds. These funds require investors to pay income taxes on all earnings from the hedge fund. Funds located outside the United States and structured under foreign laws are designated as offshore hedge funds. Many offshore financial centers encourage hedge funds to locate in their countries. The major centers include the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Dublin, and Luxembourg. The Cayman Islands is estimated to be the location of approximately 85 percent of all hedge funds. Offshore hedge funds are regulated in that they must obey the rules of the host country. However, the rules in most of these countries are not generally burdensome and provide anonymity to fund investors. Further, offshore hedge funds are not subject to U.S. income taxes on distributions of profit or to U.S. estate taxes on fund shares.

Figure 17-9 Global Hedge Fund Fees, 2006-2019


When compared to domestic hedge funds, offshore hedge funds have been found to trade more intensely, due to the low or zero capital gains tax for offshore funds. Further, offshore hedge funds tend to engage less often in positive feedback trading (rushing to buy when the market is booming and rushing to sell when the market is declining) than domestic hedge funds. Finally, offshore hedge funds have been found to herd (mimic each other's behavior when trading while ignoring information about the fundamentals of valuation) less than domestic hedge funds. Many hedge fund managers maintain both domestic and offshore hedge funds. Given the needs of their client investors, hedge fund managers want to have both types of funds to attract all types of investors.

# Regulation of Hedge Funds

While mutual funds are very highly regulated, hedge funds have generally been unregulated. Mutual funds in the United States are required to be registered with the SEC. Although hedge funds fall within the same statutory category as mutual funds, they operate under two exemptions from registration requirements as set forth in the Investment Company Act of 1940. First, funds are exempt if they have less than 100 investors. Second, funds are exempt if the investors are "accredited." To comply with SEC exemptions, hedge funds are also sold only via private placements. Thus, hedge funds may not be offered or advertised to the general investing public.

In 2010, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required hedge fund advisors with private pools of capital exceeding  \$100 million in assets to register with the SEC as investment advisors and become subject to all rules which apply to registered advisors by July 2011. Thus, previous exemptions from registration provided under the Investment Company Act of 1940 no longer apply to most hedge fund advisors. (Under the act, hedge fund managers who have less than\$ 100 million in assets under management are overseen by the state where the manager is domiciled and become subject to state regulation.) This registration subjects hedge funds to periodic inspections by SEC examiners. Further, hedge funds are required to report information to the SEC about their trades and portfolios that is "necessary for the purpose of assessing systemic risk posed by a private fund." The data are kept confidential and can be shared only with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, set up to monitor potential shocks to the economic system. Finally, should the government determine a hedge fund has grown too large or risky, the hedge fund is placed under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. Despite these new regulations and the requirement that large hedge funds be registered with the SEC, the regulations imposed on hedge funds continue to be much less onerous than those imposed on mutual funds.

Nevertheless, hedge funds are prohibited from abusive trading practices and a number of funds got mixed up in the scandals plaguing the mutual fund industry in the 2000s. For example, in March 2007, the SEC charged 14 defendants in a scheme involving insiders at UBS Securities, Morgan Stanley, and several hedge funds and hedge fund managers. The SEC claimed that the defendants made 15 million in illicit profits through thousands of illegal trades, using inside information misappropriated from UBS. Just two months prior to this announcement, regulators announced an investigation of UBS and other banks that leased office space to hedge fund traders. Regulators stated a concern about the relationship between the banks and their hedge fund "hotel guests," looking at whether the banks had been using the real estate relationships as a way to entice hedge funds to do business with them, possibly at the expense of the funds' investors. Specifically, there was an investigation into whether hedge funds located in bank buildings were paying higher than normal trading fees to banks to compensate them for the office space and failing to disclose this expense to investors.

The late 2000s saw two highly publicized scandals associated with hedge funds. The first was that of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. The Madoff investment scandal occurred after the discovery that the asset management business of former NASDAQ chair Bernard Madoff was actually a giant "Ponzi" scheme. According to a federal criminal complaint, client statements showing  \$65 billion in stock holdings were fictitious, and there was no indication that any stocks were purchased since the mid-1990s. Alerted by his sons, federal authorities arrested Madoff on December 11, 2008. The firm was placed in liquidation and a trustee was appointed on December 15, 2008, after Bernard Madoff confessed to having stolen customer property over a period of many years. On March 12, 2009, Madoff pled guilty to 11 felonies and admitted to operating what has been called the largest investor fraud ever committed by an individual. On June 29, 2009, he was sentenced to 150 years in prison with restitution of\$ 170 billion. Although Madoff did not operate as a hedge fund, he operated through various funds of hedge funds.


Another highly publicized scandal occurring in the late 2000s involved Galleon Group LLC, one of the largest hedge fund management firms in the world before announcing its closure in October 2009. The firm was at the center of a 2009 insider trading scandal that resulted in investors pulling capital from the firm rapidly. Twenty people, including Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, were criminally charged in what federal authorities call the biggest prosecution of alleged hedge fund insider trading in the United States. Prosecutors said they had evidence from wiretaps, trading records, and cooperating witnesses to prove widespread trafficking in illegal insider information—including an insider trading operation that paid sources for nonpublic information—that netted the hedge fund more than 20 million.

More recently, billionaire Steven A. Cohen and his former hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors agreed to a  \$135 million class-action settlement in November 2016. Steven Cohen is among the most famous hedge fund managers in the world. His SAC Capital is said to have returned 30 percent annually for more than 20 years since its inception in 1992. However, SAC agreed to plead guilty in 2013 to criminal-insider trading charges, and paid\$ 1.8 billion in penalties, the largest penalty on record for an insider trading case. Eight SAC employees either pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges or were found guilty at trial. Cohen himself was never charged with wrongdoing but was barred from managing money for clients for two years until January 1, 2018, on the basis that he failed to appropriately supervise his subordinates. Since shutting down SAC Capital in 2013, Cohen has been managing mostly his own \$11 billion fortune via his family office, Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen raised about \$5 billion in new money in 2018, Point72 returned about half of a percentage point for investors, preserving capital and outperforming the S&P 500, but not generating outsized returns. In 2019, Point72 returned 16.0 percent, underperforming the S&P 500.

# SUMMARY

This chapter presented an overview of the mutual fund and hedge fund industries. Mutual funds and hedge funds pool funds from individuals and corporations and invest in diversified asset portfolios. Due to the tremendous increase in the value of financial assets such as equities from 1992 through 2007 and the cost-effective opportunity that these funds offer for investors to participate in these markets, mutual funds and hedge funds have increased tremendously in size, number of funds, and number of shareholders.

c. Suppose that today 1,000 additional investors buy one share each of the mutual fund at the NAV of  \$27.135. This means that the fund manager has\$ 27,135 in additional funds to invest. The fund manager decides to use these additional funds to buy additional shares in JPMorgan Chase. Calculate tomorrow's NAV given the same rise in share values as assumed in part (b).

5. An investor purchases a mutual fund share for \$100. The fund pays dividends of \$3, distributes a capital gain of \$4, and charges a fee of \$2 when the fund is sold one year later for 105. What is the net rate of return from this investment? (LG 17-5)

6. Suppose an individual invests 20,000 in a load mutual fund for two years. The load fee entails an up-front commission charge of 2.5 percent of the amount invested and is deducted from the original funds invested. In addition, annual fund operating expenses (or 12b-1 fees) are 0.55 percent. The annual fees are charged on the average net asset value invested in the fund and are recorded at the end of each year. Investments in the fund return 7 percent each year paid on the last day of the year. If the investor reinvests the annual returns paid on the investment, calculate the annual return on the mutual funds over the two-year investment period. (LG 17-5)

7. Suppose an individual invests 10,000 in a load mutual fund for two years. The load fee entails an up-front commission charge of 4 percent of the amount invested and is deducted from the original funds invested. In addition, annual fund operating expenses (or 12b-1 fees) are 0.85 percent. The annual fees are charged on the average net asset value invested in the fund and are recorded at the end of each year. Investments in the fund return 5 percent each year paid on the last day of the year. If the investor reinvests the annual returns paid on the investment, calculate the annual return on the mutual fund over the two-year investment period. (LG 17-5)

# PENSION FUNDS DEFINED: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Pension funds are similar to life insurance companies (discussed in Chapter 15) and mutual funds (discussed in Chapter 17) in that all three attract small savers' funds and invest them in the financial markets to be liquidated at a later date. Indeed, as discussed in this chapter, insurance companies and mutual funds are main providers of pension funds. Pension funds are unique, however, in that they offer savings plans through which fund participants accumulate tax-deferred savings during their working years before withdrawing them during their retirement years. Funds originally invested in and accumulated in a pension plan are exempt from current taxation. Rather, tax payments are not made until funds are actually distributed to the fund participant, often later in his or her life.

Pension funds were first established in the United States in 1759 to benefit the widows and children of church ministers. It was not until 1875 that the American Express Company established the first corporate pension fund. By 1940, only 400 pension funds were in existence, mainly for employees in the railroad, banking, and public utilities industries. Since then the industry has boomed, so that currently over 680,000 pension funds exist. In 2016, U.S. households had 34 percent of their financial assets invested in pension funds, compared to just over 5 percent in 1950.

The pension fund industry comprises two distinct sectors. Private pension funds are those funds administered by a private corporation (e.g., insurance company, mutual fund). Because pension funds are such a large percentage of the insurance industry's business chapter
