# private pension funds

Funds administered by a private corporation.

# public pension funds

Funds administered by a federal, state, or local government.

(see below), they are often listed separately from other private pension funds. Public pension funds are those funds administered by a federal, state, or local government (e.g., Social Security). In 2019, total financial assets invested in pension funds were 28,016.1 billion: 14,539.0 billion in private funds (including life insurance companies), 9,327.6 billion in state and local government funds, and 4,149.5 billion in federal government funds (see Table 18-1). Growth of private funds was particularly significant since the 1990s as the long-term viability of the major public pension fund, Social Security, came into question.

The financial crisis of 2008-2009 produced significant losses to pension funds, forcing many soon-to-be retirees to adjust their retirement plans or scrap them altogether. The plunge in stock prices decreased the value of worldwide pension assets from  \$25 trillion to\$ 20 trillion. U.S. pension plans, which account for 61 percent of global pension assets, were especially hard hit—U.S. retirement account values fell by over 2 trillion. For individuals, lost retirement funds were especially painful—especially for consumers, who watched the value of their homes plummet, and for others who saw one or more persons in the household lose their jobs. These losses forced American workers to postpone retirement plans, work longer than they planned, take second jobs, downsize the lifestyles they had enjoyed for decades, or even all of the above.

This chapter provides an overview of the pension fund industry. In particular, we examine the size, structure, and composition of the industry. We also describe recent trends in private and public pension fund growth as well as the differences between these two major types of funds. Finally, we describe the major regulations under which the industry operates.

# SIZE, STRUCTURE, AND COMPOSITION OF THE INDUSTRY

# pension plan

Document that governs the operations of a pension fund.

In this section, we describe the various characteristics of pension funds, including insured versus noninsured pension funds and defined benefit versus defined contribution pension funds. We then present an overview of the private pension funds and public pension funds that comprise this industry.

# LG 18-2

# defined benefit pension fund

Pension fund in which the employer agrees to provide the employee with a specific cash benefit upon retirement.

# Defined Benefit versus Defined Contribution Pension Funds

A pension plan governs the operations of a pension fund. Pension funds can be distinguished by the way contributions are made and benefits are paid. A pension fund is either a defined benefit fund or a defined contribution fund. In a defined benefit pension fund, the corporate employer (or fund sponsor) agrees to provide the employee a specific cash benefit upon retirement, based on a formula that considers such factors as years of employment and salary during employment. The formula is generally one of three types: flat benefit, career average, or final pay formula. These three types of defined benefit funds are discussed in more detail next.

# flat benefit formula

Pension fund that pays a flat amount for every year of employment.

Flat Benefit Formula. A flat benefit formula pays a flat amount for every year of employment.

# EXAMPLE 18-1 Calculation of Retirement Benefit for a Defined Benefit Fund Using a Flat Benefit Formula

An employee with 20 years of service at a company is considering retirement at some point in the next 10 years. The employer uses a flat benefit formula by which the employee receives an annual benefit payment of 2,000 times the number of years of service. For retirement now, in 5 years, and in 10 years, the employee's annual retirement benefit payment is:

Retirement Benefit

<table><tr><td>Retire now</td><td>$2,000 × 20 = $40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Retire in 5 years</td><td>$2,000 × 25 = $50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Retire in 10 years</td><td>$2,000 × 30 = $60,000</td></tr></table>

# career average formula

Pension fund that pays retirement benefits based on the employee's average salary over the entire period of employment.

Career Average Formula. Two variations of career average formulas exist; both base retirement benefits on the average salary over the entire period of employment. Under one formula, retirees earn benefits based on a percentage of their average salary during the entire period they belonged to the pension fund. Under the alternative formula, the retirement benefit is equal to a percentage of the average salary times the number of years employed.

# EXAMPLE 18-2 Calculation of Retirement Benefit for a Defined Benefit Fund Using a Career Average Formula

An employee with 20 years of service at a company is considering retirement some time in the next 10 years. The employer uses a career average benefit formula by which the employee receives an annual benefit payment of 4 percent of his career average salary times the number of years of service. For retirement now, in 5 years, and in 10 years, the employee's annual retirement benefit payment is:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Average Salary</td><td>Retirement Benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Retire now</td><td>$48,000</td><td>$48,000 × 0.04 × 20 = \$38,400</td></tr><tr><td>Retire in 5 years</td><td>$50,000*</td><td>$50,000 × 0.04 × 25 = \$50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Retire in 10 years</td><td>$52,000*</td><td>$52,000 × 0.04 × 30 = 62,400</td></tr></table>

*These are based on estimates of the employee's future salary.

# final pay formula

Pension fund that pays retirement benefits based on a percentage of the average salary during a specified number of years at the end of the employee's career times the number of years of service.

Final Pay Formula. A final pay formula pays a retirement benefit based on a percentage of the average salary during a specified number of years at the end of the employee's career times the number of years of service.

# EXAMPLE 18-3 Calculation of Retirement Benefit for a Defined Benefit Fund Using a Final Pay Formula

An employee with 20 years of service at a company is considering retirement at some time in the next 10 years. The employer uses a final pay benefit formula by which the employee receives an annual benefit payment of 2.5 percent of her average salary during her last five years of service times her total years employed. For retirement now, in 5 years, and in 10 years, the employee's (estimated) annual retirement benefit payment is:

Average Salary during Last Five Years of Service

Retirement Benefit

<table><tr><td>Retire now</td><td>$75,000</td><td>$75,000 × 0.025 × 20 = \$37,500</td></tr><tr><td>Retire in 5 years</td><td>$80,000*</td><td>$80,000 × 0.025 × 25 = \$50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Retire in 10 years</td><td>$85,000*</td><td>$85,000 × 0.025 × 30 = 63,750</td></tr></table>

*These are based on estimates of the employee's future salary.

# fully funded

A pension fund that has sufficient funds available to meet all future payment obligations.

# underfunded

A pension fund that does not have sufficient funds available to meet all future promised payments.

# overfunded

A pension fund that has more than enough funds available to meet the required future payouts.

# defined contribution pension fund

Pension fund in which the employer agrees to make a specified contribution to the pension fund during the employee's working years.

# insured pension fund

A pension fund administered by a life insurance company.

# noninsured pension fund

A pension fund administered by a financial institution other than a life insurance company.

Notice that of the three benefit formulas, the final pay formula usually produces the biggest retirement benefit increases as years of service increase. This formula generally provides better protection against erosion of pension income by inflation. Benefit payments are based on the employee's career-end salary, which is generally the highest and often reflects current levels of price and wage inflation. This type of plan is also generally more costly to the employer.

Under defined benefit pension funds, the employer should set aside sufficient funds to ensure that it can meet the promised payments. When sufficient funds are available, the pension fund is said to be fully funded. Frequently, pension funds do not have sufficient funds available to meet all future promised payments, in which case the fund is said to be underfunded. While underfunding is not illegal, the pension fund is required by law to meet all of its payment obligations (see discussion below). Occasionally, pension funds have more than enough funds available to meet the required future payouts. In this case, the fund is said to be overfunded.

With a defined contribution pension fund, the employer (or plan sponsor) does not precommit to providing a specified retirement income. Rather, the employer contributes a specified amount to the pension fund during the employee's working years. The final retirement benefit is then based on total employer contributions, any additional employee contributions, and any gains or losses on the investments purchased by the fund with these contributions. For fixed-income funds, a minimum rate of return is often guaranteed, with the possibility of higher returns if fund assets earn above minimum rates of return. For variable-income funds, all investment profits and losses are passed through to fund participants. Thus, defined contribution funds provide benefits to employees in the form of higher potential returns than offered by defined benefit funds, but employees also must accept the increased risk of uncertain pension fund payouts.

# Insured versus Noninsured Pension Funds

Pension funds administered by life insurance companies are termed insured pension funds. The designation as an insured pension fund is not necessarily derived from the type of administrator but from the classification of assets in which pension fund contributions are invested. Specifically, no separate pool of assets backs the pension plan. Rather, pension plan funds are pooled and invested in the general assets of the insurance company. The amount of the insurance company's assets devoted to pension funds is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet under "pension fund reserves." For example, in 2019, life insurance companies managed a total of 3,656.0 billion in pension fund assets (reported in the liability account as "pension fund reserves"). These reserves represented 42.6 percent of the industry's total liabilities and equity.

Noninsured pension funds are managed by a trust department of a financial institution appointed by the sponsoring business, participant, or union. Trustees invest the contributions and pay the retirement benefits in accordance with the terms of the pension fund. In contrast to insured pension funds, assets managed in noninsured pension funds are owned by the sponsor and are thus segregated and listed as separate pools of assets on the trustees' balance sheet. While the day-to-day investment decisions for a noninsured pension fund are controlled by the trustee, the sponsor of the pension fund normally specifies general guidelines the trustee should follow.

Premiums paid into insured pension funds, and the assets purchased with these premiums, become the legal property of the insurance company managing the pension funds. In contrast, premiums paid into noninsured pension funds, and the assets purchased with these premiums, are the legal property of the sponsoring corporation. Because insurance companies, as the asset owners (of insured pension funds), incur the risk associated with value fluctuations in their pension fund assets, they generally concentrate their asset investments in less risky securities (bonds and low-risk mortgages). Noninsured pension fund managers, by contrast, do not incur the risk associated with asset value fluctuations. Thus, the trustees overseeing these pension funds generally invest pension premiums received in riskier securities (e.g., equities). As a result, noninsured pension funds generally offer the potential for higher rates of return but are also riskier than insured pension funds. However, the higher rates of return allow the employee to reduce contributions necessary to achieve a given amount of funds at retirement.

# LG 18-1

# Private Pension Funds

Private pension funds are created by private entities (e.g., manufacturing, mining, or transportation firms) and are administered by private corporations (financial institutions). Private fund contributions come from fund participants and/or their employers.

Defined contribution funds are increasingly dominating the private pension fund market. According to the Department of Labor, the number of defined benefit pension plans decreased from more than 100,000 in 1990 to fewer than 50,000 in 2019. Over the same time period, the number of defined contribution pension plans increased from approximately 600,000 to over 650,000. Therefore, as of 2019, more than 90 percent of private pension plans are defined contribution plans. Figure 18-1 shows private pension fund assets from 1990 to 2019. From Figure 18-1 note that as equity market values fell in 2001 and in 2008 (during the financial crisis), pension fund asset values, particularly for defined contribution funds, fell as well. As the economy recovered and equity market values increased in the midand then late 2000s, so did the value of pension fund assets. As we discuss below, this is because the main asset held by private pension funds is corporate equities. Note also that defined contribution funds are increasing in importance relative to defined benefit funds. One reason for this shift is that defined contribution funds do not require the employer to guarantee retirement benefits, and thus corporate stockholders and managers do not need to monitor the pension fund's performance once the required contributions are made.

This shift in assets—from defined benefit funds to defined contribution funds—resulted in a massive shift in the risk of retirement benefits, from employers to employees, during the financial crisis. In a defined benefit pension fund, benefits are paid out at a fixed and known amount. Thus, the employees do not bear the risk of low investment returns on contributions or of outliving their retirement income. In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are assumed by each employee and not by the employer. As stock markets plunged in value, so did the value of assets and pension payouts in defined contribution funds. As mentioned earlier, the massive decreases in pension fund values forced many American workers to postpone retirement plans, work longer than they had planned, take second jobs, and downsize the lifestyles they had enjoyed for decades.

# 401(k) and 403(b) plans

Employer-sponsored plans that supplement a firm's basic retirement plan.

Types of Private Pension Funds. Private defined benefit and defined contribution pension funds come in various types. Employees may participate in 401(k) and 403(b) plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and Keogh accounts (see Figure 18-2).

401(k) and 403(b) Plans. 401(k) and 403(b) plans are employer-sponsored plans that supplement a firm's basic retirement plan, allowing for both employee and employer contributions (e.g., Supplementary Retirement Accounts offered by TIAA-CREF). While

401(k) plans are offered to employees of taxable firms (contributions made by employers or plan sponsors are tax deductible), 403(b) plans are for employees of certain tax-exempt employers (e.g., hospitals and educational institutions). Contributions to these plans are taken on a pretax basis and thus reduce the employee's taxable salary. Further, employers often contribute an additional percentage of the employee's salaries or contributions to the funds (e.g., match amount). Both the contributions and earnings then grow tax deferred until they are withdrawn. Most of these plans are transferable to another 401(k) or 403(b) plan, or an IRA, if the employee changes jobs. Figure 18-3 shows the growth in 401(k) plans: from  \$1,061 billion in 1996 to\$ 6,200 billion in 2019. Percent of 401(k) plan assets invested in mutual funds increased from 33 percent in 1996 to 65 percent in 2019.

Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans generally make their own choice of the allocation of assets from both employee and employer contributions (e.g., the choice among investing in equity, bonds, and money market securities). However, in December 2001 the U.S. Labor Department released a statement that for the first time allowed financial service companies to provide specific advice to retirement plan participants provided that the advice comes from a qualified financial expert that is independent of the plan provider. Previously, to avoid conflicts of interest (such as a plan provider steering plan participants to investments that generate higher fees for the company and reduce net returns for the investor), retirement plan providers generally could do no more than come up with general recommendations of what investors should buy or sell, avoiding naming specific mutual funds. Table 18-2 shows the allocation of assets by age of participants in 401(k) plans in

*Equities include equity funds, company stock, and the equity portion of balanced funds.

2016. Younger participants invest the majority of their contributions in equities, while older participants invest more heavily in fixed-income bond and guaranteed investment contract (GIC) funds. Included in this group are also target date funds, which rebalance portfolios to become less focused on growth and more focused on income as the fund approaches the target date of the fund. Target date funds follow a predetermined reallocation of risk over time. The funds are aimed at a specific retirement year and are an aggregation of many mutual funds, sometimes as many as 25. The choice of asset allocation affects the fund's payout during retirement, similar to defined contribution funds.

# EXAMPLE 18-4 Calculating the Return on a 401(k) Plan

An employee contributes 10 percent of his 75,000 salary into the company's 401(k) plan. The company matches 40 percent of the first 6 percent of the employee's salary. The employee is in the 31 percent tax bracket and the 401(k) plan expects to yield an 8 percent rate of return. The employee's own contribution and his plan return for one year are calculated as follows.

1. Employee's gross contribution = $75,000 × 0.10 = $ 7,500
2. Tax savings² = $7,500 × 0.31 = $ 2,325
3. Employee's net of tax contribution  $\overline{\mathbb{S}} 5,175$
4. Employer's contribution = $75,000 × 0.40 × 0.06 = $1,800
5. Total 401(k) plan investment at year's start 9,300
6. One-year earnings = $9,300 × 0.08 = $ 744
7. Total 401(k) investment at year-end 10,0

Employee's one-year return  $= \left( {{\\ }_{10},{044} - \$ 5,{175}}\right) /\$ 5,{175} = {94.09}\%$

Assuming the employee's salary, tax rate, and 401(k) yield remain constant over a 20-year career, when the employee retires, the 401(k) will be worth:

$$
\$ 9,300 \left(\left[ (1 + 0.08) ^ {20} - 1 \right] / 0.08\right) = \$ 425,586
$$

The employee's net of tax contributions over the period total  $\ 5,175 \times 20 = \$  103,500 .

The allocation of a fund's assets across different types of securities can have a significant effect on the fund's returns and risks.

1. A GIC is a long-term liability issued by insurance companies. A GIC guarantees not only a rate of interest over some given period but also the annuity rate on a beneficiary's contract (see Chapter 15).
2. The employee will have to pay taxes on the funds as he withdraws funds during retirement. However, the tax rate is likely to be lower and tax payments are delayed by several years.

# EXAMPLE 18-5 Impact of Asset Allocation on a 401(k) Plan Return

An employee contributes  \$10,000 to a 401(k) plan each year, and the company matches 20 percent of this annually, or\$ 2,000. The employee can allocate the contributions among equities (earning 10 percent annually), bonds (earning 6 percent annually), and money market securities (earning 4 percent annually). The employee expects to work at the company 30 years. The employee can contribute annually along one of the three following patterns:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Option 1</td><td>Option 2</td><td>Option 3</td></tr><tr><td>Equities</td><td>60\%</td><td>50\%</td><td>40\%</td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Money market securities</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td></tr></table>

The terminal value of the 401(k) plan, assuming all returns and contributions remain constant (at 12,000) over the 30 years,[4] will be:

# Option 1:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 6) \left(\left[ (1 + 0. 1 0) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 1 0\right) + 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 4) \left(\left[ (1 + 0. 0 6) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 0 6\right) \\ = \$ 1,563,836 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Option 2:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 5) \left(\left[ (1 + 0. 1 0) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 1 0\right) + 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 3) \left(\left[ (1 + 0. 0 6) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 0 6\right) \\ + 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 2) \left[ \left(1 + 0. 0 4\right) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 0 4) = \$ 1, 4 0 6, 1 7 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Option 3:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 4) \left[ \left(1 + 0. 1 0\right) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 1 0) + 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 5) \left[ \left(1 + 0. 0 6\right) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 0 6) \\ + 1 2, 0 0 0 (0. 1) \left[ \left[ (1 + 0. 0 4) ^ {3 0} - 1 \right] / 0. 0 4 \right] = \$ 1, 3 3 1, 2 2 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that Option 1, which includes the largest investment in equities, produces the largest terminal value for the  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plan, while Option 3, with the smallest investment in equities, produces the smallest terminal value. However, as discussed in Chapter 3, equity investments are riskier than bond and money market investments. Thus, the larger the portion of funds invested in equities, the higher the return risk of the pension plan—that is, the more uncertain the final (terminal) value of the plan. For example, suppose the economy slumped and equity investments earned only a 3 percent annual return over the 30 years the employee worked. In this case, the terminal value of the  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plan would be:

$$

In this case, Option 3, which involves the smallest investment in risky equities, produces the largest terminal value for the  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plan.

# individual retirement accounts (IRAs)

Self-directed retirement accounts set up by employees who may also be covered by employers-sponsored pension plans.

Individual Retirement Accounts. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are self-directed retirement accounts set up by employees who may also be covered by employer-sponsored pension plans as well as self-employed individuals. Contributions to IRAs are made strictly by the employee. IRAs were first allowed in 1981 as a method of creating a tax-deferred retirement account to supplement an employer-sponsored plan. As of 2020, a maximum of  \$6,000 may be contributed to an IRA per year, and nonworking spouses may contribute an additional\$ 6,000. If either spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan, the couple's adjusted gross income must be less than \$206,000 for the contribution to be tax deductible.[5] IRAs may also be used by employees changing jobs. Any funds held by an employee in the old employer's pension fund may be invested in a tax-qualified IRA to maintain the tax-deferred status. At the end of 2019, IRA account assets were greater than \$11.0 trillion.

In 1998, a newer type of IRA, a Roth IRA, was established. Like a regular IRA, in 2020 Roth IRAs allow a maximum  \$6,000 after-tax contribution per individual (\$ 12,000 per household) and the cap will increase as that on regular IRAs increases. Unlike a regular IRA, contributions to a Roth IRA are taxed in the year of contribution, and withdrawals from the account are tax-free (provided funds have been invested for at least five years and the account holder is at least  $59\frac{1}{2}$  years old). Roth IRAs are available only to individuals or households with an adjusted gross income of less than  $\$139,000$  or less than  $\$206,000$ , respectively. Table 18-3 summarizes the main differences between a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA. As of 2006, Roth 401(k) and 403(b) retirement options also became available. As in a Roth IRA, contributions are taxed in the year of contribution and withdrawals are tax-free.

Most IRA contributions are invested in mutual funds purchased through a broker or a mutual fund company. Choices of funds include stocks, bonds, futures, and U.S. Treasuries. Depository institutions usually handle CDs for their IRA customers. Whether a Roth IRA is a better option than a traditional IRA depends on the individual's expectation of his or her future tax bracket. Traditionally, retirees moved into a lower tax bracket. However, recently more retirees maintain high levels of income even in retirement. These individuals may be better off paying taxes on their IRA contributions during their working years (as under a Roth IRA). There are many websites available that calculate the advantage of a Roth IRA versus a traditional IRA for individuals (e.g., www.schwab.com). Appendix 18A (available through Connect or your course instructor) shows how an IRA can grow during an individual's working years to produce a significant sum of money for retirement.

Keogh Accounts. A Keogh account is a retirement account available to self-employed individuals. Contributions by the individual may be deposited in a tax-deferred account administered by a life insurance company, a bank, or other financial institution. As with 401(k) plans, the participant in a Keogh account is given some discretion as to how the funds are to be invested.

The two types of Keogh plans are profit-sharing and money-purchase plans. Money-purchase plans require a mandatory contribution (at a constant percentage of the employee's income) each year whether the individual has profits or not. Profit-sharing plan contributions can vary by year. The most attractive feature of a Keogh retirement plan is the high maximum contribution allowed. Money-purchase plan contributions can be as high as the lesser of  \$56,000 or 25 percent of the individual's self-employment income. Profit-sharing plan contributions can vary from 0 to 25 percent of the individual's income, up to\$ 56,000.[6]

Pension funds sponsored by the federal or state and local governments are referred to as public pension funds. In 2020, these funds managed assets of more than 13.48.

LG 18-4

State or Local Government Pension Funds. Employees of state or local governments may contribute to pension funds sponsored by these employers. Most are funded on a "pay as you go" basis, meaning that contributions collected from current employees are the source of payments to the current retirees. As a result of the increasing number of retirees relative to workers, some of these pension funds (e.g., the state of Illinois) have experienced a situation in which contributions have not been high enough to cover the increases in required benefit payments (the pension funds are underfunded). Some state and local governments have proposed tax increases to address this underfunding. Others have considered modifying the pay as you go method of funding contributions to operate their funds more like private pension funds. Without some modifications, many of the state and local government funds will increasingly be unable to maintain their promised payments to retirees, especially as the longevity of the population increases.

Federal Government Pension Funds. The federal government sponsors two types of pension funds. The first type are funds for federal government employees: civil service employees, military personnel, and railroad employees. Civil service funds cover all federal employees who are not members of the armed forces. This group is not covered by Social Security. Similar to private pension funds, the federal government is the main contributor to the fund, but participants may contribute as well. In addition to Social Security, career military personnel receive retirement benefits from a federal government-sponsored military pension fund. Contributions to the fund are made by the federal government, and participants are eligible for benefits after 20 years of military service. Employees of the nation's railroad system are eligible to participate in the federal railroad pension system. Originated in the 1930s, contributions are made by railroad employers, employees, and the federal government.

The second type of fund, and the largest federal government pension fund, is Social Security. Also known as the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Fund, Social Security provides retirement benefits to almost all employees and self-employed individuals in the United States. Social Security was established in 1935 with the objective of providing minimum retirement income to all retirees. Social Security is funded on a pay as you go basis; current employer and employee Social Security taxes are used to pay benefits to current retirees. Historically, Social Security tax contributions have generally exceeded disbursements to retirees. Any surpluses are held in a trust fund that can be used to cover required disbursements in years when contributions are insufficient to cover promised disbursements. Contributions, also known as the FICA tax, are a specified percentage of an individual's gross income (in 2020, 7.65 percent, for employees, and 15.30 percent, for self-employed individuals, of the first 137,700 earned). Employee contributions are matched with equivalent employer contributions.[7]

As the percentage of the population that is retired has increased and the percentage of the population that is working has decreased, Social Security tax revenue has dropped relative to benefits being paid out (i.e., Social Security is an underfunded pension fund). Indeed, in 2010 Social Security payouts exceeded revenues (excluding interest) for the first time, six years earlier than had been projected in 2009. Further, 2020 projections were that the Social Security system will be bankrupt (annual contributions and trust fund assets will be insufficient to cover required disbursements to retirees) by 2034. At that point, the extra reserves in the funds would be depleted and Social Security would be able to pay out in benefits only as much as it collects in payroll tax revenue. That would cause a 24 percent automatic cut in benefits. In other words, beneficiaries would receive only 76 cents for every 1 in benefits they would normally get. As a result, the federal government is currently considering new methods and ideas (discussed later) for fully funding the Social Security system.

# FINANCIAL ASSET INVESTMENTS AND RECENT TRENDS

Employer and employee contributions made to pension funds are invested in financial assets. These investments are tracked by the Federal Reserve because of the increasing importance of pension funds as participants in national and international security markets.

# Private Pension Funds

Financial assets (pension fund reserves) held by private pension funds in 1975 and 2019 are reported in Table 18-4. Financial assets held by pension funds totaled  \$244.3 billion in 1975 and\$ 10,883.0 billion in 2019. In 2019, some 66.28 percent of pension fund assets were in corporate equities or equity mutual fund shares. This compares to 44.61 percent in 1975. In fact, pension funds are the largest institutional investor in the U.S. stock market. Certainly the booming stock market was a major reason for the increased investment in equities by pension funds in the 1990s. For example, in 1999 corporate equities and equity mutual fund shares composed 64.71 percent of private pension fund assets. The fall in stock market values in 2001-2002 resulted in a drop in this percentage to 55.87 percent at the end of 2002. The even larger financial crisis that followed years later resulted in a change in this percentage from 72.56 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2008 to 62.43 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2009.

Figure 18-4 shows differences between defined benefit and defined contribution fund investment portfolio allocations. In 2019, defined benefit funds had 34.11 percent of their funds invested in U.S. government securities and corporate and foreign bonds compared to 7.27 percent for defined contribution funds. Also, defined benefit funds had 34.17 percent of their assets invested in corporate equities compared to 23.27 percent by defined contribution funds. In contrast, defined contribution funds had 52.37 percent of their funds invested in mutual fund shares compared to 12.13 percent for defined benefit funds.

Defined benefit pension funds offer employees a guaranteed payout, while defined contribution funds do not. The promise made of a guaranteed retirement payment is likely a major reason for the larger percentage of investments in fixed-income securities made by defined benefit funds. Defined contribution funds do not offer a guaranteed retirement payout—thus, defined contribution fund administrators are more likely to invest in risky equities and equity mutual fund shares. The introduction of equities into these funds helps reduce the funding contributions required of the plan sponsor.

# Public Pension Funds

Financial assets held by state and local government pension funds in 1975 and 2019 are reported in Table 18-5. Like private pension funds, state and local pension funds held most of their assets in corporate equities or equity mutual fund shares (38.04 percent in 2019). Second in importance were U.S. government securities and bonds (11.14 percent in 2019). In 1975, 23.32 percent of pension fund assets were in equities and 66.03 percent were in U.S. government securities and bonds.

In the early 2010s, state and local government pension funds faced a total shortfall of at least 4 trillion in their funding of employees' pensions and retirement benefits, and the financial problems were only growing. During the 2000s, many states contributed only the minimum required funds to their pensions. In 2000, states were required to pay only

6. What the major financial assets held by public pension funds are?

\$27 billion total into their funds. By fiscal year 2008, that amount had more than doubled to a\$ 64 billion deposit. As stock market returns fell and the U.S. economy entered a steep recession, state revenues fell dramatically. Yet states were calculating required pension contributions using assumptions based on interest rates and stock market growth rates experienced during boom markets. These unrealistic assumptions regarding reinvestment rates meant that states significantly undercontributed to their pension funds. Under these circumstances, the minimum contributions made in "good times" were insufficient to keep up with promised payouts. In fiscal 2000, half of the 50 states had fully funded their pension systems. In fiscal year 2017, only three states—South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin—were able to cover their pension liabilities. Kentucky, New Jersey, and Illinois have the worst-funded retirement systems in the nation, in part because policymakers did not consistently set aside the amount their own actuaries said was necessary to cover the cost of promised benefits to retirees. As a result, the pension funds in those three states had less than half of the assets needed to cover liabilities in 2017. The growing bill from promised pension payouts coming due to states could have significant consequences for taxpayers, resulting in higher taxes, less money for public services, and lower state bond ratings.

At the federal level, Social Security contributions are invested in relatively low-risk, low-return Treasury securities. This, along with the fact that the growth of the population is slowing and the percentage of the population in retirement is increasing, has led to questions regarding the long-term viability of the Social Security fund (and the Social Security system in general). To bolster public confidence, the Social Security system was restructured in the mid-1990s by raising contributions and reducing retirees' benefits. For example, full retirement age was 65 for many years. However, beginning with individuals born in 1938 or later, that age will gradually increase until it reaches 67 for people born after 1959. Further, the wage contribution increases virtually each year (e.g., the contribution as a percentage of an employee's income was 6.2 percent of the first  \$72,600 in 1998 and 7.65 percent of the first\$ 137,700 in 2020).

In the late 1990s, several proposals were also introduced as possible ways of bolstering the Social Security fund's resources. For example, in December 2001 the Bush administration's Presidential Commission on Social Security Reform proposed changes to the Social Security system that included personal retirement accounts. After 12 years and several more suggestions for reform yet no major changes, in 2013 President Obama proposed changing the way the government adjusts Social Security benefits by switching to a measure called the chained consumer price index (CPI). Using a chained CPI, Social Security benefits would increase by a bit less each year than under the current formula; this rate of a gradual change would allow savings to grow over time. According to Congressional Budget Office calculations, if the chained CPI were implemented, Social Security benefits would be about  \$30 a month lower by 2023. By 2033, Social Security payments would be 3 percent lower than they would be using the current measure of inflation. In 2017, Congressman John B. Larson, the Ranking Member of the Ways & Means Subcommittee on Social Security, introduced the "Social Security 2100 Act." The bill represented a comprehensive plan to rescue Social Security from its pending trust fund insolvency in 2035, making the program sustainably solvent for the next 75 years and beyond while also increasing benefits. The Social Security 2100 Act proposed to (1) increase the combined payroll tax rate by 2.4 percentage points, from 12.4 to 14.8 percent, phased in by 0.1 percentage point per year over 24 years; (2) apply the entire payroll tax to earnings above\$ 400,000 and, ultimately, to all income as the current wage-indexed maximum of \$132,900 caught up; (3) offer some benefit credit for new taxes paid by increasing benefits by 2 percent of all wage income above \$400,000; (4) increase the income threshold for taxation of 85 percent of Social Security benefits to \$50,000 for single filers and \$100,000 for joint filers, up from \$34,000 and \$44,000; (5) increase the lowest Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) factor in the benefit formula from 90 to 93 percent, increasing benefits across the board; (6) use the faster-growing, experimental Consumer Price Index for the elderly (CPI-E) for cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs); and (7) create a minimum benefit of 125 percent of the poverty line for people who have worked 30 years or more. While benefit expansions in the legislation would worsen Social Security's shortfall by about a third, tax increases in the legislation would not only offset this cost, but also restore long-term solvency to the trust fund. Despite these calls for reform, no major reform of Social Security has been realized.

# REGULATION

LG 18-5 www.dol.gov

The major piece of regulation governing private pension funds is the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (also called the Pension Reform Act). While ERISA does not mandate that employers establish pension funds for their employees, it does require them to meet certain standards if a fund is to be eligible for tax-deferred status. ERISA was passed when many workers, who had contributed to pension funds for years, were failing to receive their pension benefits in a timely fashion. ERISA charged the Department of Labor with the task of overseeing pension funds. The principal features of ERISA involve pension plan funding, vesting of benefits, fiduciary responsibility, pension fund transferability, and pension fund insurance.

Funding. Prior to ERISA, there were no statutory requirements forcing defined benefit fund administrators to adequately fund their pension funds. Specifically, funds sometimes operated such that employees' annual contributions to pension funds were insufficient to meet promised annual pension obligations. ERISA established guidelines for funding and set penalties for fund deficiencies. Contributions to pension funds must be sufficient to meet all annual costs and expenses and to fund any unfunded historical liabilities over a 30-year period. Further, any new underfunding arising from low investment returns or other losses has to be funded over a 15-year period. For some companies the required obligations resulting from ERISA were significant. For example, after ERISA was enacted, General Motors had to put  \$7.3 billion into its underfunded pension funds, while Ford Motor Company had to add\$ 3.3 billion. Indeed, this provision of ERISA is one reason many companies switched from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans, as discussed earlier.

Despite these changes in required funding, unrealistic assumptions regarding reinvestment rates have led to significant underfunding of many pension funds. Other than the two bear markets of the 2000s, stock markets surged for a period of about 20 years. As a result, pension fund managers could realistically assume that funds would earn a rate of return of at least 8 or even 9 percent. However, since the mid-2000s, these rates are too optimistic. Yet many pension funds continue to use them as the higher rates make underfunding appear to be smaller. However, after a prolonged period of near zero interest rates and falling stock market values, the result is huge increases in underfunded pension funds.

Underfunded pension liabilities for single-employer plans surged to  \$823 billion in 2012 and\$ 759 billion in 2013, the largest values ever (see Figure 18-5). Not all of this underfunding posed a major risk to participants and the pension insurance fund, however. Most companies that sponsored defined benefit plans were financially healthy and would be able to meet their pension obligations to their workers. However, the federally sponsored pension fund insurance agency, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) estimated its loss exposure to reasonably possible terminations (e.g., underfunded plans sponsored by companies with credit ratings below investment grade) at approximately \$155 billion in 2019, down from \$295 billion in 2012.

# vested employee

An employee who is eligible to receive pension benefits because he or she has worked for a stated period of time.

Vesting of Benefits. Frequently, while employers start contributing to an employee's pension fund as soon as the employee is eligible to participate, benefits may not be paid to the employee until he or she has worked for the employer for a stated period of time (or until the employee is vested). For example, prior to ERISA, some plans required their employees to work 15 and even 25 years before they were eligible to receive pension benefits. ERISA requires that a plan must have a minimum vesting requirement and sets a maximum vesting period of 10 years.

Fiduciary Responsibilities. A pension plan fiduciary is a trustee or investment advisor charged with management of the pension fund. ERISA set standards governing pension fund management. Specifically, ERISA required that pension fund contributions be invested with the same diligence, skill, and care as a "prudent person" in like circumstances (the prudent-person rule). Fund assets are required to be managed with the sole objective of providing the promised benefits to participants. To ensure that a fund operates in this manner, ERISA requires pension funds to report on the current status (e.g., market value of assets held, income and expenses of the fund) of the pension fund.

Despite ERISA's fiduciary standards governing pension fund management, in 2002 Congress moved to implement changes in pension and corporate governance rules after the Enron failure caused thousands of workers to lose their retirement savings, which were heavily weighted in company stock. Enron matched its employees'  $401(\mathrm{k})$  contributions with company stock but barred workers from selling this stock until age 50. Further, when Enron's stock price was rising, employees included more shares of the company's stock in their pension funds. However, as the stock price plunged when Enron's accounting problems were revealed, management barred employees from selling their shares of Enron. It was estimated that Enron employees lost  \$3 billion in retirement funds after the energy trader filed for bankruptcy and its stock price fell to less than\$ 1 (from a high of over \$80). Historically, labor laws limited the assets of traditional pension funds that may be held in employer stock or property to 10 percent. But the laws exempted  $401(\mathrm{k})$  funds from that provision, hoping to encourage employers to offer retirement plans. The 2002 changes rescinded this exemption.

Transferability. ERISA allowed employees to transfer pension credits from one employer's fund to another's when switching jobs.

Insurance. ERISA established the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC), an insurance fund for pension fund participants similar to the FDIC. The PBGC insures

LG 18-6 participants of defined benefit funds if the proceeds from the fund are unable to meet its promised pension obligations. As of 2019, the PBGC was responsible for the pensions of about 1.5 million participants and beneficiaries in more than 4,900 plans that have failed since PBGC was established. During 2019, PBGC assumed financial responsibility for 47 underfunded single-employer plans that were terminated. There is a maximum benefit guarantee that changes over time. Thus, workers covered by a failed pension plan may not be paid in full. For example, in 2019 the maximum annual coverage for workers who will begin receiving payments from PBGC at age 65 is 67,295.

When PBGC was created in 1974, the single-employer premium was a flat-rate \$1 per plan participant. Congress raised the premium to \$2.60 in 1979 and to \$8.50 in 1986. In 1987, the basic premium was raised to \$16 and an additional variable-rate premium was imposed on underfunded plans up to a maximum of \$50. In 1991, Congress set the maximum at \$72 per participant for underfunded plans and 19 per participant for fully funded plans.

Despite these premium increases, however, PBGC has generally operated at a deficit since its inception. This reflects the fact that unlike the FDIC, the PBGC has little regulatory power over the pension funds it insures. Thus, it cannot use portfolio restrictions or on-site supervision to restrict the risk taking of fund managers.[8] Partly in response to the growing PBGC deficit, the 1994 Retirement Protection Act was passed. Under the act (in 1997), the  \$72 premium cap was phased out (80 percent of underfunded plans were at the cap in 1997). Thus, underfunded programs were subjected to even higher premiums (some as high as several hundred dollars per participant).[9] Thus, like the FDIC in 1993, the PBGC has changed to a more overtly risk-based premium plan. As a result of these changes, in 2000 the PBGC's insurance fund operated at a record surplus of\$ 9.7 billion. However, bankruptcies of several large companies (e.g., United Airlines, LTV Steel, Bethlehem Steel) in the early 2000s resulted in the agency posting a deficit of 23.3 billion and a call for additional reform at the beginning of 2005.

This call resulted in the passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which called for increasing the annual premiums paid by companies to  \$30 per worker from\$ 19 and the imposition of automatic increases in premiums each year (which would be tied to average wage increases of U.S. workers). As of 2019, rates are  \$80 per participant for single-employer plans and\$ 29 per participant for multi-employer plans. Underfunded pension plans pay an additional variable rate charge of $43 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits. In addition, the act gives companies 5 years (rather than the previous 20 years) to make up shortfalls in their defined benefit pension plans. Finally, the Pension Protection Act requires companies to tell investors and employees well before any pension fund becomes significantly underfunded. This gives interested parties a chance to pressure companies to increase pension funding.

Pension systems around the world take many forms. For example, even within Europe there is wide variation in pension systems. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark, and Switzerland all have a tradition of state- (or public-) funded pension schemes, while Spain, Portugal, and Italy have less developed pension systems, and France uses a pay-as-you-go pension system. The systems of other countries vary greatly in their details. However, the extent to which a person's contributions (made to the system during his or her working years) are linked to the benefits that he or she receives in retirement is one characteristic that distinguishes systems. For example, France and Germany are among the countries where the relationship between the benefits people receive in retirement and the taxes they pay during their working years is relatively weak. Such countries have typically offered generous benefits to those who take early retirement. As a result of drains on the pension funds from early retirement options and soaring national deficits incurred as a result of the financial crisis, many of these countries have begun to experience problems in the financing of public pensions and they have had to undertake reforms that strengthen the link between contributions and benefits. At the other extreme are countries such as Sweden, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Chile, which impose a tight relationship between a person's payments into the system and the benefits received during retirement. Some of these countries have strengthened this link by shifting some of the financing of state pensions into private sources. Although these countries are relatively well prepared to handle the problem of an aging population, several are considering reforming their systems.

Reforms of pension systems in other countries have included benefit reductions, measures to encourage later retirement, and expansions of private funding for government pensions. For example, in many countries reforms include raising the age at which a person is eligible for pension benefits. This type of reform recognizes increased life expectancy. Finland has taken the step of indexing its full pension retirement age to life expectancy, and several countries have taken steps to encourage people to remain in the labor force as they get older. Some have done so by strengthening the link between contributions and benefits. For example, Sweden introduced notional accounts by which participants can see their potential pension benefits rise as they work longer and contribute more to the system. Other countries have taken steps to reduce payments to persons who retire before the established retirement age. Many countries have traditionally offered generous benefits to people who choose to retire early, although early retirees typically receive a smaller annual pension than persons who wait until they are older to retire. However, the difference in retirement payments in many countries has not been sufficient to discourage large numbers of people from retiring early.

The European debt crisis forced many countries to reform their pension systems. For example, France's parliament approved a bill that increased the retirement age from 60 to 62. As part of the bailout plan organized by the International Monetary Fund, Greece made changes that increased the retirement age and cut automatic bonuses that retirees received at Christmas, Easter, and during the summer. Spain proposed to stop inflation-linked increases in pensions and raised its retirement age from 65 to 67. The retirement age for British workers was raised to 68, at which time they can start getting their full pension. Politicians from Athens to Madrid targeted pension reform as a way to offset government debt. The reforms sparked weeks of strikes and protests. Unions across Europe took to the streets to protest the new rules. On June 23, 2010, French workers held more than 200 demonstrations nationwide. A strike in Madrid on June 29, 2010, led to clashes with police. Strikes in Greece shut down airports, ferry service, banks, and hospitals. Protests since the start of September 2010 repeatedly brought more than one million people onto the streets. Yet, with nearly everyone in Europe eligible for a public pension, governments approved the plans that were necessary to continue to finance national pension funds.

According to the OECD's "Pensions at a Glance 2019" report, the OECD average for net replacement rates of an average earner from mandatory (public and private) schemes is 58.6 percent (see Table 18-6). The net replacement rate represents the level of pension benefits (net of taxes) in retirement relative to earnings when working. Across the OECD member countries, the net replacement rate ranges from a low of 28.4 percent in the United Kingdom to a high of 93.8 percent in Turkey, 91.8 percent in Italy, 90.1 percent in Luxembourg, 89.9 percent in Austria, and 89.6 percent in Portugal. Elsewhere, the pension rate in the United States is 49.4 percent, while in China, which is home to more than 1.4 billion people, the rate is 79.4 percent, OECD data show. In India, also home to 1.4 billion people, the pension rate is quite generous at 94.8 percent. Table 18-6 also shows that the average retirement age in the OECD countries is 66, while the average retirement age in the United States is 67.

# SUMMARY

This chapter provided an overview of the pension fund industry. Pension funds provide a way of accumulating retirement funds similar to life insurance contracts and mutual funds. Pension funds, however, have a tax advantage in that an employee's contributions to pension funds are exempt from current taxation. The chapter reviewed the types of funds offered by private companies (financial institutions) and by federal and state or local governments. Given the problems with the funding of public pension funds and the phenomenal increase in stock market values, growth in private pension funds has been larger than any other type of financial institution. We looked at the distribution of asset investments for both private and public pension funds and highlighted their differences. The chapter also reviewed the major piece of regulation governing the industry, ERISA, and the role played by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).

# PROBLEMS

1. Your employer uses a flat benefit formula to determine retirement payments to its employees. The fund pays an annual benefit of 2,500 per year of service. Calculate your annual benefit payments for 25, 28, and 30 years of service. (LG 18-2)
2. An employer uses a career average formula to determine retirement payments to its employees. The annual retirement payout is 5 percent of an employee's career average salary times the number of years of service. Calculate the annual benefit payment under the following scenarios. (LG 18-2)

<table><tr><td>Years Worked</td><td>Career Average Salary</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>60,000</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>62,500</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>64,000</td></tr></table>

3. An employee with 25 years of service at a company is considering retirement at some time in the next 10 years. The employer uses a final pay benefit formula by which the employee receives an annual benefit payment of 3.5 percent of her average salary during her last five years of service times her total years employed. The employee's average salary over the last 5 years of service is as follows:

Average Salary during Last Five Years of Service
