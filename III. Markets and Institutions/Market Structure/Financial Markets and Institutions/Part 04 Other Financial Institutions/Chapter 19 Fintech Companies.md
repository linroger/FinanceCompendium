# INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the financial sector has seen fast-growing adoption of financial technology, or fintech. According to the 2020 report by CB Insights, global venture capital (VC)—backed fintech funding has increased from  \$3.9 billion in 2013 to\$ 41.4 billion in 2018 and 35.0 billion in 2019 (Figure 19–1). Banks are increasing their investments in fintech as well. Over the period of 2012 to 2019, the most active U.S. banks investing in fintech startups include Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The fintech adoption rate, which measures fintech users as a percentage of the digitally active population, varies by country. The average fintech adoption rate globally has moved steadily upward, from 10 percent in 2015, to 33 percent in 2017, to 64 percent in 2019. China and India lead other countries at 87 percent, followed by Russia and South Africa at 82 percent. Fintech adoption rate for the United States is 46 percent, followed by Belgium and Luxembourg at 42 percent. Among fintech services, the most commonly used category is money transfer and payments, with

75 percent of consumers using at least one service in this category. In China, where money transfer and payment apps are pervasive, the adoption rate is 95 percent. In addition to consumers, fintech companies are increasingly interested in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Across the markets that EY surveyed, SMEs in China displays the highest fintech adoption rate at 61 percent, followed by the US, at 23 percent. The fintech adoption rate by SMEs average 25 percent globally.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) defines fintech as "technology-enabled innovation in financial services that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on the provision of financial services."3 It is important to note that the term fintech is used here to describe a wide variety of innovations both by incumbent FIs and new entrants, be they startups or larger technology firms. This chapter begins with a discussion of why fintech has evolved into such a disruptive force in the financial services industry, describes the changing relationship between fintech startups and banks, and moves on to the types of fintech innovations and regulatory approaches to fintech.

# THE EVOLUTION OF FINTECH

Technological innovations have long been essential part of the financial services industry. The history of fintech innovation goes as far back as 1800s. In 1865, a device known as the pantelegraph, an early form of fax machine, was invented by Giovanni Caseli. Used predominantly to verify signatures in banking transactions by sending and receiving transmissions on telegraph cables, this invention is widely regarded to be the first step in the journey toward fintech as we know it today.4 In 1866, the laying of the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable provided the fundamental infrastructure that enabled a period of strong financial globalization.5

In 1918, the Fedwire (Federal Reserve's Wire Transfer Network) was established by the Federal Reserve Banks to transfer funds and connect all 12 Reserve Banks by telegraph using the Morse code-based system. In 1933, the German Reich mail service held a trial run of the world's first telex network, where a typewriter keyboard replaced the Morse key on a telegraph set.[6] In 1958, Western Union started to build a telex network in the United States. In 1960, Quotron Systems introduced the Quotron, the first electronic system to provide stock quotes in real time to stockbrokers and money managers to electronic screens, instead of a printed ticker tape. In 1966, the telex network replaced the telegraph as the standard for long-distance instantaneous communication of information, where any user on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other user all around the world. This flexibility opened the doors for global communication of financial transactions and information.

The late 1960s and 1970s saw rapid advances in electronic payment system. For example, Barclays Bank installed the first automated teller machine (ATM) in London. To receive their cash from the machine, users were required to insert paper checks issued by a teller or cashier. These checks were marked with carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, as a security measure because the magnetic coding for ATM cards had not yet been developed. ATMs were followed by the establishment of the Inter Bank Computer Bureau (later renamed as Bankers Automated Clearing Services or BACS) in the UK in 1968, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) in the United States in 1970, and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) in 1973.

One of the biggest transformations of the fintech landscape took place in 1971 with the establishment of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, or NASDAQ. As the world's first electronic stock market, it helped reduce the bid-ask spread (the difference between bid and ask price of a stock) and end fixed securities commissions in 1975. The 1980s saw the rise of electronic trading, bank mainframe computers, and more sophisticated data and record-keeping systems. In the 1990s, the Internet and e-commerce business models flourished. The result was the introduction of online stock brokerage websites aimed at retail investors, replacing the phone-driven retail stock brokering model. The early 2000s saw stock market decimalization, algorithmic trading, and high-frequency trading (HFT).

While developments of these technologies became mainstream and widely used by FIs and their customers, the financial services sector was not threatened by these technological innovations. On the contrary, FIs grew. In looking at the FDIC data, the number of bank branches in the United States grew steadily from approximately 4,200 in 1948 to over 82,400 in 2008. After staying at that level until 2012, the number of bank branches started falling from 2013, the trend that seems to continue today (Figure 19-2). So, what caused this reversal in a decades-long growth trend in bank branches and the emergence of fintech?

# LG 19-1

We now discuss examples of supply and demand factors provided by economists and analysts at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as well as UBS, to explain why fintech is evolving into what it is today.[8]

In terms of supply factors, researchers discuss the role of the 2008 global financial crisis, which left brand image of banks severely shaken. In the wake of the financial crisis, banks shifted to comply with post-crisis regulatory developments and cost-cutting measures. As regulatory burdens increased and risk aversion rose, banks pulled back from some lending activities. With banks pulling back, some new players entered the marketplace with innovative products that used technology to overcome some of the advantages that incumbent banks had, including their network of branches. For example, some of the earliest peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders catered specifically to borrowers that banks were pulling back from, like small businesses and riskier consumers.

Another supply factor was macroeconomic conditions, the low interest rate environment in particular. The low interest rate environment put downward pressure on profits and increased the incentives of FIs to cut costs. Technology can often be a way to help cut costs, and fintechs have focused on this. For example, online marketplace lenders have streamlined traditional loan underwriting processes in order to reduce costs.

One of the demand factors is the increasing prevalence of mobile technology. When the first iPhone was released in June 2007, it leapfrogged far beyond the competition and launched the mobile revolution. The iPhone-led and Google Android-fueled mobile boom changed everything. When Steve Jobs first unveiled the iPhone, he described it as a "revolutionary mobile phone" and a "breakthrough Internet communications device."

# smartphone penetration rate

Smartphone subscribers as a percentage of total population.

Figure 19-3 shows the effect of this Internet device on the usage of mobile phones: the usage of voice has been relatively steady, while mobile Internet traffic has exploded. The explosion in data traffic was boosted by iOS and Android apps over the years. While Apple's App Store launched in 2008 with 500 apps, by the first quarter of 2019, it was offering 2.2 million apps. The Android Market, which later became Google Play, was launched three months after the Apple's App Store. By the first quarter of 2019, Google Play reached 2.6 million Android app mark.[10]

Apps have turned phones into everything from a bank to a motion-sensitive video game device, upending major industries such as PC market, telecommunications companies, movie and TV business, gaming industry, health industry, and now the financial services industry. Global smartphone penetration (smartphone subscribers as a percentage of total population) has reached 66.9 percent in 2019.[11] The penetration rate in the United States is 86 percent, followed by China at 82 percent, Indonesia at 73 percent, Brazil at 68 percent, Mexico at 63 percent, and India at 52 percent. While most developed countries are already highly penetrated, large mobile Internet markets are emerging in the developing world. China overtook the United States to become the largest smartphone market by installed base in 2012; four years later, India also overtook the United States. Indonesia and Brazil are growing fast as well; the number of smartphone connections in Indonesia is approaching that of the United States. Rapid growth of the smartphone markets in China and India is consistent with what we saw at the beginning of the chapter, where China and India lead the world in terms of fintech adoption rate.

Another demand factor is demographics. According to the Pew Research Center, millennials became the largest generation in the labor force in 2016, representing 35 percent of the labor force participants in the United States.[12] As a result, the financial, economic, and sociopolitical prominence of the millennials is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. Millennials are digital natives with high technological fluency. They are optimistic about technology and the benefits it may bring not only to their personal lives, but also to society at large. They have a lingering distrust in banks because of what their parents went through during the financial crisis.[13] Consistent with these arguments, the 2017 ComScore report stated that millennials appear to be by far the most comfortable spending money to buy apps: 64 percent of millennials have paid to download an app within a year, and nearly one out of five paid to download an average of at least one app every month. A 2017 UBS Evidence Lab study found that millennials make 2.26 financial transactions per week on average on their smartphones versus 0.83 through a branch. In addition to using their bank's mobile app regularly, they are more likely than other generations to use P2P mobile payments, get online financial advice, or use digital currency like Bitcoin.

While the preceding list of supply and demand factors is in no way exhaustive, it gives us a good overall picture about how a collection of supply and demand factors led to the emergence of fintech. Now, retail financial services are being further digitized via mobile wallets, payment apps, robo-advisors for wealth and retirement planning, equity crowdfunding platforms for access to private and alternative investment opportunities, and online lending platforms. Some services are enhancements to existing banking services; others are replacing banking services completely. The first version of the now-dominant cryptocurrency Bitcoin was released in 2009. In 2011, Google Wallet (which later became Google Pay) allowed consumers to use smartphones equipped with a near-field communication chip to make "tap payments." In 2017, Ant Financial, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, launched "Smile to Pay," which enabled consumers to authenticate mobile payments by scanning their face with a smartphone.

# CHANGING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANKS AND FINTECHS

As fintechs made their way into the financial services landscape and gained traction, commentators and observers started pointing to the coming demise of banks. Fintechs have advantages such as being unburdened by regulators, legacy IT systems, branch networks, or not having the need to protect existing businesses. Additional advantages include an innovation mindset, agility, and a consumer-centric perspective. As a result, some have questioned whether banks will exist in the future.[14] Others predicted that the established banking industry will be transformed into something akin to "narrow banking," where traditional banks would take deposits and hold only safe, liquid assets, while fintech platforms would match borrowers and savers. In April 2015, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, famously warned in his annual letter to shareholders that "Silicon Valley is coming." After all, Amazon decimated independent book retailers and iTunes did the same for music stores.

In the 2015 survey of global CEOs by PwC, 56 percent of CEOs expressed concerns about cross-sector competition, and 32 percent named technology as sector from which significant competitors were emerging, far more than those who named any other sector.[15] In the 2016 survey, 76 percent of the respondents feared some part of their business was at risk to fintech, and 73 percent of the executives believed consumer banking was the sector most likely to be disrupted by fintechs. When asked to name specific threats, close to

70 percent of the respondents said loss of market share, another 70 percent said pressure on margins, and 50 percent mentioned increase in customer churn.[16] McKinsey's 2015 annual review of global banking estimated that in five major retail banking businesses (consumer finance, mortgages, SME lending, retail payments, and wealth management) from 10 to 40 percent of revenues will be at risk by 2025, and between 20 and 60 percent of profits.[17]

However, this bleak outlook began to change over time, and the shape of tech-dominated retail banking started becoming clearer. Retail banks still hold, and will retain, a huge advantage. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), retail banks have three "big Cs" on their side: customers, compliance, and capital.[18] Compared to fintechs, big banks have tens of millions of trusting customers who interact with them every day. They have decades of compliance experience and experienced legal teams. Finally, banks have a cost of capital close to zero. Fintech companies generally have much higher cost because of their capital funding structures. Therefore, instead of hand-to-hand combat, banks are learning to embrace fintech. As EIU points out, banks will have to work on another "big C"—culture. Culture must change if banks are to harness digital symbiosis.

A 2017 report by AMTD Asset Management described the evolving relationship between incumbent banks and fintech firms in four stages (Figure 19-4) as most fintech CEOs expect increasing fintech-bank partnership going forward. While some still believe that fintech companies are in direct competition with banks, these partnerships prove that fintech companies and banks can have mutually beneficial partnerships in which the fintech companies can leverage on the banks' reputation and the banks can leverage on fintech companies' technology infrastructure to better service their customers.

According to McKinsey Panorama, almost 80 percent of FIs had entered into fintech partnerships by the end of 2018. The most active U.S. bank investors in fintech (by number of portfolio companies) are Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. While all three have ramped up their fintech investment activity in recent years, they've taken different strategic approaches. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are the most active investors largely because of their investment arms—Goldman Sachs Strategic Investments and

# BaaS

Process that allows fin-techs and other third parties to connect with banks' systems directly via application programming interfaces so that they can build banking offerings on top of the banks' infrastructure to reach users outside of the banks' existing footprint.

# open banking

A system that provides a user with a network of FI's data using APIs. By opening APIs to sharing, third parties have easier access to financial information for existing bank customers, which allows them to build new apps and services.

Citi Ventures—which have participated in 21 and 11 fintech deals since 2018, respectively. As a result, the two banks continue to invest in a wide range of fintech sectors.

Since 2017, Goldman Sachs has focused its fintech investments on real estate, data analytics, and payments and settlement. Betting on these subindustries aligns with Goldman's digital strategy of scaling its consumer offering, Marcus. Citi has backed four blockchain, three capital markets, and three payments and settlement startups since 2017. Generally, these investments fit into the banks' larger strategy of building open banking infrastructure. In March, Citi announced plans to build a "digital consumer payments business for institutions," and there are rumors Citi may launch a banking-as-a-service platform. JPMorgan, meanwhile, remains focused on strengthening its capital market solutions and scaling its payments business. The bank has backed four capital markets startups and four accounting startups (including startups focused on accounts payable/accounts receivable) since 2017. Over the same time period, JPMorgan also made bets on two companies in each of the payments and settlement, regtech, and lending categories. Other banks that have backed at least five fintech startups since 2012 include Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and PNC Financial Services Group.

Banks' areas of focus have shifted over the years as new technologies emerge and consumer tastes evolve. In 2018, banks backed a record number of deals to fintech startups, diversifying their bets across a wider range of fintech spaces. Payments and settlement, capital markets, and data analytics have been longstanding frontrunners in terms of deals. Blockchain, meanwhile, has cooled since garnering a high level of investor interest in 2015. In 2019, the most popular investment categories have been real estate, capital markets, and wealth management.

# Banking-as-a-Service

In financial services, banking-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms have surfaced as a key component of open banking, in which banks provide more financial transparency options for account holders by opening their application programming interfaces (APIs) for third parties to develop new services. As fintechs have been encroaching on incumbent institutions in the banking game, tech-savvy legacy banks are turning this looming threat into an opportunity by moving into the BaaS space. BaaS is an end-to-end process that allows fintechs and other third parties to connect with banks' systems directly via APIs so they can build banking offerings on top of the providers' regulated infrastructure, as well as unlock the open banking opportunity reshaping the global financial services landscape.

The BaaS process begins with a fintech or other third-party provider (TPP) paying a fee to access the BaaS platform. The financial institution opens its APIs to the TPP, thereby granting access to the systems and information necessary to build new banking products or offer white label banking services. In addition to getting ahead in open banking, legacy institutions that launch their own BaaS platforms are also opening up new revenue streams. The two main monetization strategies for BaaS include charging clients a monthly fee for access to the BaaS platform or charging a la carte for each service used. Recently IBM has found that approximately 79 percent of bank executives believe that the adoption of platform-based business concepts will help them obtain a viable competitive edge and ensure better innovation, profitability, and expansion to new markets. Overall, the value of the global digital banking platform market is projected to hit 8.67 billion by 2027. It's becoming clear that banking software as a service is integral to sustained growth strategies of global banks, and it's already proving its relevance in bringing the whole financial sector into the digital age.

The open banking movement began in the UK and has consequently spread across Europe. Growing customer demand and pressure from competitors is forcing the United States to start playing catch-up. In 2018, BBVA launched its BaaS platform, Open Platform, in the United States. HSBC launched its Connected Money app in May 2018 in response to the UK's open banking regulations that attempt to place more control of financial data into the hands of consumers. Connected Money allows customers to view various bank accounts, as well as loans, mortgages, and credit cards, in one place.

# THE TYPES OF FINTECH INNOVATIONS

LG 19-3

This section discusses various fintech innovations and solutions to date. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) categorizes fintech innovations into three product sectors, as well as market support services (Figure 19-5). The three sectors relate directly to core banking services, while the market support services relate to innovations and new technologies that are not specific to the financial sector but also play a significant role in fintech developments.

The BCBS conducted an informal survey of its members, asking them to identify the significant fintech products and services within their jurisdictions. Based on the survey, the BCBS reports that there were 298 providers for payments, clearing, and settlement services (41 percent); 195 providers in market support services (27 percent); 130 providers in credit, deposit, and capital-raising services (18 percent); 66 providers in investment management services (9 percent); and 38 providers in other services (5 percent) as of February 2018. Within the payments, clearing, and settlement category, retail payment services firms represented the majority of fintech firms identified. Because the majority of the service providers are in payments, clearing, and settlement services, as well as market support services (combined 68 percent), the following sections will emphasize recent developments in these two areas.

www.bis.org/bcbs/

# Payments, Clearing, and Settlement Services

The payments landscape has been transformed by the application of technology both behind the scenes (clearing and settlement) and at the point of sale (POS). Fintech players span a broad spectrum and include card networks, merchant acquirers, POS players, digital payment platforms, person-to-person companies, bill payment companies, and money transfer companies.

# mobile wallet

An app on the mobile device that stores payment information from a credit or debit card.

Mobile Wallets On the retail side, e-wallet or mobile wallet services take advantage of ubiquity of smartphones.[19] A mobile wallet is an app on the mobile device that stores payment information from a credit or debit card. The major mobile wallets are Apple Pay, www.venmo.com www.zellepay.com

Figure 19-5 Sectors of Innovative Services

# cryptocurrency

A digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

Samsung Pay, and Google Pay. Most mobile wallets use near field communication (NFC) technology to allow users to pay for purchases without handing over a credit or debit card. In January 2018, Google announced a rebrand of its consumer payment products and merged Android Pay and Google Wallet into a single, unified service known as Google Pay. Statista estimated that Apple Pay has 441 million users worldwide as of September 2019. According to Auriemma Consulting Group, Apple Pay makes up 77 percent of the mobile wallet transactions, and Samsung Pay and Google Pay make up 17 percent and 6 percent of transactions, respectively.[20] There are also mobile wallets from FIs such as Chase, Capital One, MasterCard, and Visa and merchants such as Walmart and Starbucks.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Payments P2P payment or transfer services let customers use a bank account or a credit/debit card to pay friends and family from their mobile phones. Popular P2P money transfer apps include PayPal, Venmo, and Square Cash. PayPal is perhaps the best known of these services as it has 267 million active accounts.[21] Since separating from eBay in 2015, PayPal has been signing more partnerships and making acquisitions in a bid to gain an edge over rivals in the highly competitive digital payments market. PayPal is also the most expensive if customers don't want to connect the service to their bank account. It charges a 2.9 percent fee for money sent from a debit or credit card, and it also charges an extra 30 cents on top of that. One advantage is that PayPal allows the largest transactions. Using PayPal, customers can transfer up to \$10,000. Venmo is more popular among millennials. In 2014, PayPal acquired Venmo, as part of its \$800 million acquisition of payment processing startup Braintree.

Zelle is another popular payment app and offers customers a unique way to pay friends and family from their bank. If a customer has an account at a participating bank, he or she can send cash with same-day transfers to anyone else with an account at a participating bank. The growing list of participating banks includes titans such as Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, and online banking leaders Ally and Capital One. In 2015, Facebook introduced Facebook Payments as part of the Messenger app. It allows customers to connect their Visa or MasterCard debit card and tap a "$" button to send friends money on iOS, Android, and desktops with zero fees.

Digital Currencies Digital currencies or cryptocurrencies combine new payment systems with new currencies that are not issued by a central bank. The "crypto" in cryptocurrencies refers to complicated cryptography that allows for a particular digital token to be generated, stored, and transacted securely and anonymously. Examples of privately issued digital currencies include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP (XRP). Bitcoin and other digital currencies are underpinned by distributed ledger technology (DLT), which is an electronic ledger or database that records and verifies transactions made using the currency. Because DLT can be adapted for other uses across the financial system, we will discuss it later in the chapter along with other market support services.

The Bitcoin White Paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the first Bitcoin was mined in 2009.[22] Because the Bitcoin protocol is open source, anyone could take the protocol, modify the code, and start their own version of P2P money. The digital currencies modeled after Bitcoin are collectively called altcoins and have tried to present themselves as modified or improved versions of Bitcoin. For example, Litecoin launched in 2011, XRP launched in 2012, and Ether launched in 2015.

Cryptocurrency can be said to also be a crypto-asset or a sub-class of crypto-assets, but not all crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies. In short, a cryptocurrency is a store of value and a way to transfer that value among users of the currency. It doesn't do much more than that. Crypto assets usually have many of the same features of a cryptocurrency in that there will be a token that serves as a store of value with the ability to transfer that

The most well-known example of this is Ethereum. This is a crypto-asset network where the token used as a currency is Ether. The network also enables the building of smart contracts that allow conditions to be set for what happens when a certain trigger event takes place. Smart contracts will be discussed later in this chapter along with other distributed ledger networks.

In Figure 19-6, the high volatility of crypto-assets compared to the S&P 500 index is notable. Over the period of March 2016 to December 2019, average daily return volatility of Bitcoin and Ether were 3.82 percent and 5.85 percent, respectively, compared to 0.73 percent for the S&P 500 index. We can also see the dramatic rise and fall of cryptocurrencies in late 2017 and early 2018, which is referred to as 2018 cryptocurrency crash. After an unprecedented boom in 2017, the price of Bitcoin fell by 27 percent in January 2018, then 33 percent in March 2018. Nearly all other cryptocurrencies also peaked from December 2017 through January 2018, and then followed Bitcoin. The cryptocurrencies' market capitalization lost at least US342 billion in the first quarter of 2018, the largest loss in cryptocurrencies up to that date. By September 2018, cryptocurrencies collapsed 80 percent from their peak in January 2018, making the 2018 cryptocurrency crash worse than the dot-com bubble's 78 percent collapse.[23] Bitcoin price rebounded sharply in 2019 before fading. Still, this performance was better than that of Ether.

In February 2018, Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), condemned Bitcoin as "a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster." The last point refers to the energy-intensive process of "mining" the digital currency.[24] Pointing out that the mining process to create new bitcoins uses the same amount of electricity as Singapore each day, Carstens said, "the current fascination with these cryptocurrencies seems to have more to do with speculative mania than any use as a form of electronic payment, except for illegal activities." His comments came the day after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned about Bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as a "very risky" and "entirely speculative" asset.[25] In a June 2018 interview, Carstens argued that cryptocurrencies are not money. Instead, they are a form of investment, an asset. He said, "Cryptocurrencies do not fulfill any of the three purposes of money. They are neither a good means of payment, nor a good unit of account, nor are they suitable as a store of value. They fail dramatically on each of these counts."[26]

# central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)

A new form of digital central bank money that can be distinguished from reserves or settlement balances held by commercial banks at central banks.

Interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) has also risen in recent years. CBDC is potentially a new form of digital central bank money that can be distinguished from reserves or settlement balances held by commercial banks at central banks. According to the BIS, issuance of a CBDC would probably not alter the basic mechanics of monetary policy implementation, including central banks' use of open market operations.[27] CBDC introduces a new type of central bank money whose demand—like cash—would need to be accommodated. CBDC would also not necessarily affect the discretion that central banks have in choosing their monetary policy implementation techniques (e.g., reliance on purchases of securities or credit operations with banks) as well as the maturity, liquidity, and credit risk of their assets. However, if flows into CBDC were to become large and not associated with offsetting declines in physical banknotes, as could be the case in times of financial stress, challenges could arise (such as a need to broaden the assets that the central bank can hold or take on as collateral).

A November 2018 discussion paper by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that "CBDC could strengthen the benefits and reduce some of the costs and risks to the payment system and could help encourage financial inclusion. However, demand will

Two researchers, working at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development, looked at the energy costs of four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, and Litecoin. These researchers, Max Krause and Thabet Tolaymat, found that it takes between 7 and 14 megajoules (MJ) of energy to create a U.S. dollar's worth of cryptocurrency, more than the energy required to physically mine for a dollar's worth of copper or gold, in a paper published in the journal Nature Sustainability. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0152-7

Moreover, there are other payment solutions to help central banks more fully achieve their goals relative to money. CBDC will have to contend with operational risks arising from disruptions and cyberattacks.[28] IMF chief Christine Lagarde also called for exploration of digital currencies.[29] Various central banks around the world are "seriously" considering the issuance of digital currency, including Canada, China, Sweden, and Uruguay, she said. Lagarde said in her speech that "This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to cash. Of course, challenges remain. My goal, at this point, is to encourage exploration."

Value Transfer Networks On the wholesale side, corporate and business customers' need for modernization in payments is just as strong, and increasing numbers of fintech providers of all sizes and types are turning their attention to wholesale payments innovation. For example, commercial payments provider FLEETCOR Technologies recently launched a blockchain-based pilot program with enterprise blockchain solutions firm Ripple and international payments company Cambridge Global Payments to improve international settlements.[30] Cambridge Global Payments processes more than 20 billion in business-to-business cross-border payments annually, helping 13,000 business clients make international payments to suppliers and employees. Meanwhile, cross-border payments provider Transpay recently rolled out a new direct-to-bank deposit service in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, enabling freelance workers to receive direct deposit payments in their preferred currencies.[31]

Business-to-Business (B2B) Payments Payments technology giant Visa decided to take the M&A route with its fintech partner of nearly a decade, Fraedom, as Visa continued to press further into the B2B payments space. The company announced in February 2018 that it would acquire the expense management software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm that already underpins Visa's IntelliLink Spend Management platform, designed for commercial and small business customers.[32] At the time, Visa said the takeover would "strengthen and expand Visa's business suite of solutions to meet the rapidly evolving needs" of the B2B payments industry.

Payments company Square took further inroads into the B2B space, particularly through its Square Capital solution, strengthening its position in corporate customers' back offices. Last June, the company announced a partnership with B2B e-commerce platform Handshake to further that initiative.[33] Businesses procuring goods on the Handshake Direct e-commerce website and mobile app are now able to use major credit cards to make their payments, while vendors selling on the platform can see those funds deposited into their accounts within two business days, with transactions powered by Square. Accounts receivable solution provider Billtrust and global payments company Flywire announced their joint venture in May to tackle friction in cross-border B2B payments, including the high fees and long waits typically associated with the process.[34]

Foreign Exchange (FX) Wholesale In January 2018, the French leading company in digital banking services for businesses, Qonto, partnered with Kantox to add FX management and international payments to its range of financial solutions. Qonto's customers will have access to real-time exchange rates and to enjoy Kantox transparent pricing in all their spot and forward operations to regain complete control about their FX risk.

# cryptocurrency exchanges

Exchanges that allow consumers to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies, whether through fiat currency like dollars, euros, or yen, or another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ether.

www.coinbase.com development of its Dynamic Hedging platform, FX management fintech Kantox not only enables its B2B clients to eliminate the risks of market volatility, it can also integrate and automate the entire process into its existing operational software.[35]

Digital Exchange Platforms Along with the global expansion of the crypto world, crypto exchanges are creating systems to ensure the blockchain ecosystem remains stable. These exchanges can bridge the traditional business world to the new digital cryptocurrency world. However, this bridge requires incorporation of fiat currencies, such as the HKD (Hong Kong Dollar), into these digital exchange platforms.[36] With the HKD joining a crypto exchange, more people will have the opportunity to trade cryptocurrencies and thus furthering the mainstream adoption of the digital crypto world.

The first thing individuals need to do if they are looking to invest more money in crypto is convert their fiat currency to crypto. For U.S. investors, that means depositing U.S. dollars (USD) with an exchange in order to get BTC or ETH. The exchanges that accept fiat currencies are called "fiat gateways." Because they deal in USD, they're subject to many regulations, and they have to meet reporting requirements from state and federal agencies. This makes fiat exchanges more difficult to set up than crypto-to-crypto exchanges. It also means that fiat exchanges usually have limited trading pairs because those trading pairs are regulated. As such, if individuals want to buy a niche altcoin, they will usually have to purchase ETH or BTC at a fiat exchange and then transfer those funds to a crypto-to-crypto exchange in order to buy the token you want.

According to Coin Central, the top cryptocurrency exchanges for USD deposits include Coinbase, CoinMama, GDAX, Kraken, CEX.io, LocalBitcoins, BitStamp, Gemini, BitFlyer, BitQuick, and PaxFul. Crypto-to-crypto exchanges include Binance, Bittrex, Cryptopia, KuCoin, and Poloniex.[37] Protections seen in the stock trading world don't exist for cryptocurrencies. The biggest potential danger for an investor is losing an entire investment, whether through theft by hackers from the exchange holding the assets or by the exchange going out of business. Among the recent cyberthefts, Coincheck had nearly 500 million in digital tokens stolen in January 2018, and two South Korean exchanges were breached in June 2018. Half a dozen or more of the largest exchanges have failed since mid-2014, some following a hack (including Mt. Gox, once the world's No. 1 exchange) and others after being shut down by the authorities. CoinMarketCap listed 326 major crypto exchanges as of May 31, 2019.[38]

Most recently, two groups of highly sophisticated cyber criminals likely have stolen some 1 billion in cryptocurrency hacks, a sum that accounts for the majority (at least 60 percent) of the money lost in such scams, according to a new report from Chainalysis. Moreover, the two entities probably are still active, said Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a maker of software that tracks cryptocurrency transactions. Chainalysis said the two hacker groups employed an extensive network of digital wallets to hide their tracks and later converted the money to physical cash through online exchanges and individual transactions. The stolen funds were transferred an average of 5,000 times before they were converted into cash, Chainalysis found.[39] Authorities around the world are only slowly waking up to the opportunities and dangers of crypto trading, and their responses have been mixed. While Japan introduced a licensing system for digital-asset exchanges last year, China, once the global center of crypto activity, is now undertaking the most strident crackdown.[40]

# Market Support Services

# distributed ledger technology (DLT)

A digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data store or administration functionality.

# blockchain

One type of a distributed ledger. It bundles transactions into blocks that are chained together and then broadcasts them to the nodes in the network.

Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain, Smart Contracts) The emerging fin-tech industry has provided us with a radical alternative to record information: distributed ledger technology (DLT). Traditionally, centralized entities have been responsible for maintaining records. These centralized entities are trusted not to distort ledgers in their own favor because they stand to lose their franchise values in the event that the public discovers fraudulent activity. In contrast, a distributed ledger is a database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network. The distribution is unique: records are not communicated to various nodes by a central authority but are, instead, independently constructed and held by every node. That is, every single node on the network processes every transaction, coming to its own conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make certain the majority agree with the conclusions. Once there is consensus, the distributed ledger has been updated, and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger. Such ledgers can contain different types of shared data, such as transaction records, attributes of transactions, credentials, or other pieces of information.

Blockchain is a particular type of a DLT. Blockchain organizes data into blocks (or batch of transactions) that are chained together in an append-only data structure. New additions to the database are initiated by one of the members (nodes), which creates a new "block" of data, for example, containing several transaction records. This approach can be used to record transactions on any asset which can be represented in a digital form (see Figure 19-7).

All members have a copy of the shared database/ledger. When a member wants to send money to another member (e.g., A to B), a "block," or chunk of data, is created to represent the transaction.

Cryptography is used to share the transaction with the group while also maintaining privacy if the parties desire. The network recognizes the transaction as valid because the digital signature—which only the signatory can see—is mathematically linked to a public signature that only a bona fide transaction could bear.

Once a block is confirmed, all members add the block to their copies of the database.

Complex mathematics are used to ensure that there is consensus among the database copies, which prevents tampering.

DLT has been closely linked to digital currencies since its inception because it was invented as the underlying technology of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The inventor of Bitcoin, writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, described the technology in a 2008 white paper as an "electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party." Since the introduction of blockchain technology, the industry has been exploring ways of leveraging the technology beyond Bitcoin. The use of DLT is being explored, in particular, for payment, clearing and settlement activities because of potential efficiency gains arising from the technology. These potential gains include simplifying the settlement and related reconciliation processes required of actors participating in payment, clearing, and settlement arrangements. For example, these actors could include banks, broker-dealers, custodians, registries, a central securities depository, a securities settlement system, a central counterparty, a trade repository, and a payment system. DLT can also be found on the capital markets infrastructure value chain: access to capital, trade execution, post-trade services, data, analytics and information services, and operations and technology. A 2018 report by McKinsey and World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) lists a selection of blockchain use cases at exchanges, organized by the type of solutions.[41] For example, under access to capital, the report lists blockchain uses by the London Stock Exchange (LSE), NASDAQ, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and the Korea Exchange. Under trade execution, the report includes blockchain uses by the CME Group, the Intercontinental Exchange, the Singapore Exchange, etc. Under clearing and settlement, the report mentions blockchain uses by the Australian Securities Exchange, Euronext, Deutsche Borse, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, etc.

DLT may radically change how assets are maintained and stored, obligations are discharged, contracts are enforced, and risks are managed. Proponents of the technology highlight its ability to transform financial services and markets by (1) reducing complexity; (2) improving end-to-end processing speed and, thus, availability of assets and funds; (3) decreasing the need for reconciliation across multiple record-keeping infrastructures; (4) increasing transparency and immutability in transaction record keeping; (5) improving network resilience through distributed data management; and (6) reducing operational and financial risks. DLT may also enhance market transparency if information contained on the ledger is shared broadly with participants, authorities, and other stakeholders.

The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) cautions that the use of DLT does not come without risks.[42] In most instances, the risks associated with payment, clearing, and settlement activities are the same irrespective of whether the activity occurs on a single central ledger or a synchronized distributed ledger. That said, DLT may pose new or different risks, including (1) potential uncertainty about operational and security issues arising from the technology; (2) the lack of interoperability with existing processes and infrastructures; (3) ambiguity relating to settlement finality; (4) questions regarding the soundness of the legal underpinning for DLT implementations; (5) the absence of an effective and robust governance framework; and (6) issues related to data integrity, immutability, and privacy. DLT is an evolving technology that has not yet been proven sufficiently robust for wide-scale implementation.

Many of the top banks are engaging in blockchain proofs of concept. R3, a blockchain startup, launched in 2014 with ambitious plans of supplying blockchain technology to a consortium of major banks. Its Corda platform got off to a fast start as the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs agreed to be founding members of the consortium. It currently has over 200 members, including FIs, technology companies, and trade associations. R3 encountered a setback in 2016, however, when some of its blue chip members—including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Santander—left the consortium. As a Goldman insider told Fortune at the time, the bank chose to let its www.bis.org/cpmi/ www.r3.com

# smart contracts

Self-executing contracts or applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. In smart contracts, the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller are directly written into lines of code. Trust between the parties is not an issue because the transaction is witnessed and verified by hundreds of people; therefore, there is no need for an intermediary.

# artificial intelligence (AI)

The term was first used by John McCarthy to denote machines that could think autonomously. He described the threshold as "getting a computer to do things which, when done by people, are said to involve intelligence." According to the Brookings Institute, AI is generally thought to refer to "machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment, and intention."

# machine learning

A method of designing a sequence of actions to solve a problem, known as algorithms, which optimize automatically through experience and with limited or no human intervention. Machine-learning algorithms find and apply patterns in data.

efforts as the technology matures. Stock exchanges around the world are also investigating and testing DLT to improve securities trading platforms, including NASDAQ, the NYSE, and the LSE. DLT could disrupt the way stocks are issued and traded and, in the long term, potentially replace existing trading platforms run by stock exchanges.[45]

Smart contracts are applications made possible by blockchains. While a standard contract outlines the terms of a relationship (usually one enforceable by law), a smart contract enforces a relationship with cryptographic code. Put differently, smart contracts are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. Ethereum is the biggest, most widely used, and most developed smart contract platform in the world. However, NEO, dubbed "the Chinese Ethereum," is a new player on the scene.[46]

Ethereum launched in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin imagined a system where the computing power of the blockchain's nodes could be used for more than just hashing a proof of work algorithm. Instead, Buterin argued, that processing power could be used to execute contracts and applications as part of the blockchain. These smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) would run as part of the blockchain's network. No one server or computer could control these applications, and they would continue to exist as long as the Ethereum network continued. This was a revolution for blockchain technology. Up until this point, blockchain had mostly been used as a simple value transfer (like Bitcoin). With the rise of Ethereum, developers could write code to run on the blockchain that was tamper-proof and immutable once they submitted it. Ethereum's cryptocurrency, Ether, is used to compensate the owner of whichever computer platform ends up running the smart contract.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Computer scientists and statisticians have developed advanced techniques to obtain insights from large data sets. Data may be of different types, from different sources, and of different quality. These techniques can leverage the ability of computers to perform tasks, such as recognizing images and processing natural languages, by learning from experience. The application of computational tools to address tasks traditionally requiring human sophistication is broadly termed artificial intelligence (AI). While AI has existed for many years, recent increases in the availability of data have resulted in a resurgence of interest in potential applications of AI (see Figure 19-9). Machine learning is a subcategory of AI. Machine learning may be defined as a method of designing a sequence of actions to solve a problem, known as algorithms, which optimize automatically through experience and with limited or no human intervention. These techniques can be used to find patterns in large amounts of data (big data analytics) from different sources. Generally speaking, machine learning algorithms are used to identify patterns that are correlated with other events or patterns. The patterns that machine learning identifies are merely correlations, some of which are unrecognizable to the human eye.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are being rapidly adopted for a range of applications in the financial services industry. In September 2017, former Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit predicted that 30 percent of banking jobs could be wiped out by AI in five years.[47] According to Accenture, optimal efficiencies are likely to first be seen in back-office functions, where robotic process automation (RPA) is already having a significant impact. But a greater use of intelligent automation—that is, virtual workforces that can learn and adapt to the needs of the business—is already filtering through to some middleand front-office operations. That includes, for example, the use of robo-advisory services. As humans and AI start to work together in this domain, banks will really begin to feel the

45. Blockchain technology is making its way into nonfinancial industries as well. For example, Walmart uses blockchain technology from IBM to trace its products' journey from manufacturer to store shelf. Global shipping giant Maersk uses the same technology to track shipping containers, making it faster and easier to transfer them and get them through customs. Other companies using blockchain technology to track goods include Kroger, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, and Unilever. Everledger, a company started in April 2014 with the intention of creating a blockchain-based registry of every certified diamond in the world, already has 2.2 million diamonds in its registry. By logging 40 different measures of each stone, blockchain helps reduce fraud in the diamond market. https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-blockchain-will-survive-even-if-bitcoin-doesnt-1520769600

Source: FSB, "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Financial Services: Market Developments and Financial Stability Implications," November 2017.

Many applications, or "use cases," of AI and machine learning already exist. According to the FSB, some of the current and potential use cases of AI and machine learning include:[49]

FIs are using AI and machine learning methods to assess credit quality, to price and market insurance contracts, and to automate interactions with customers.

FIs are optimizing capital allocations, back-testing models, and analyzing the market impact of trading large positions.

Hedge funds, broker-dealers, and other asset management firms are using AI and machine learning to find mispriced assets and factors to generate abnormal returns.

Publicand private-sector institutions may use AI and machine learning for regulatory compliance, surveillance, data quality assessment, and fraud detection.

For example, BankMobile, the digital-only subsidiary of Customers Bank, deployed AI software to lend to millennial and Gen X students, who have been called "thin-file consumers" due to their slow adoption of credit.[50] JPMorgan Chase has invested in technology and recently introduced a Contract Intelligence platform designed to analyze legal documents and extract important data points and clauses. Manual review of 12,000 annual commercial credit agreements normally requires approximately 360,000 hours. Results from an initial implementation of this machine learning technology showed that the same amount of agreements could be reviewed in seconds. Santander introduced red robots to show guests around its Spanish visitor center in 2010. UBS has Amazon's digital assistant Alexa on customer service duty, JPMorgan is using robots (the invisible kind) to execute trades, and Morgan Stanley has an AI fraud detection team. In April 2018, HSBC said it would follow suit by using AI to detect money laundering, fraud, and terrorist funding.[51]

In March 2018, S&P Global made the largest AI deal in history by acquiring a fin-tech firm Kensho. At 550 million, the deal is larger than Google's reported purchase of DeepMind Technologies and Intel's acquisition of Nervana Systems, in addition to AI acquisitions by Apple and Twitter.[52] The SEC staff leverages big data to develop text analytics and machine learning algorithms to detect possible fraud and misconduct. They also use machine learning to identify patterns in the text of SEC filings.[53] While BCBS categories (Figure 19-5) focus on banking-related fintech innovations, there are plenty of AI and machine learning solutions related to insurance (insurtech) and regulatory compliance (regtech). For example, in January 2017, Liberty Mutual announced plans to develop automotive apps with AI capability and products aimed at improving driver safety.[54] As of January 2019, Deloitte has identified 276 regtechs providing solutions to the ever-increasing demands of compliance within the financial industry.[55]

# Internet-of-Things (IoT)

Refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the Internet, all collecting and sharing data. Connecting up all these different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence to devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling them to communicate real-time data without involving a human being.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) In the broadest sense, the term Internet-of-Things (IoT) encompasses everything connected to the Internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that "talk" to each other. The IoT is made up of connected devices from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables. Wearable devices have arguably been the easiest "win" for banks so far, thanks to a growing ecosystem of devices and the relative low cost associated with getting started. Many banks now provide applications for popular wearables like Apple Watch and FitPay, which is already working with the Bank of America. Some banks have even launched their own devices, with Barclays unveiling bPay wearable contactless payment solutions and other wearable bands coming from Caixa Bank, Hellenic Bank, and Australia's WestPac (with PayWear).

Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Wells Fargo, and trading firm Brighann Cotton claim to have completed the first global trade transaction between two banks using blockchain, smart contracts, and the IoT. The transaction involved a shipment of cotton from Texas to Qingdao in China, using the efficiencies of a distributed ledger—Skuchain's Brackets system—for all parties. The trade involved an open account transaction, mirroring a letter of credit, executed through a collaborative workflow on a private distributed ledger among the seller (Brighann Cotton US), the buyer (Brighann Cotton Marketing Australia), and their respective banks (Wells Fargo and Commonwealth Bank). The trade introduced a physical supply chain trigger to the terms of the transaction to confirm the geographic location of goods in transit before a notification is sent to allow for release of payment. The tracking feature adds a new dimension, providing all parties with greater certainty compared with traditional open account and trade instruments like letters of credit, which focus on documents and data.[56]

In a recent experiment, Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group's (CYBG) customer innovation lab opened a test bed in London where it tested a number of smart devices to improve the customer experience. For example, facial detection technology was used to judge how users interacted with the space, while web access was offered through interactive touchscreens.[57] Bluetooth beacons also represent an opportunity for retail banks to reinvigorate underused high street branches.[58] US Bank, WestPac in New Zealand and Citi are all using beacon technology, while it was recently revealed that Chase is testing beacon technologies to pre-announce customers that opt into the service before they approach a human bank teller or ATM.[59] At Barclays, beacons have been used to help disabled passengers navigate branches.[60]

# robo-advice

Online services that provide automated portfolios based on your preferences, such as time horizon, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Robo-advisors compare personal preferences against market conditions to automatically recommend a portfolio that fits investors' needs.

# Credit, Deposit, and Capital-Raising Services

Fintech innovations regarding credit, deposit, and capital-raising services include crowdfunding, lending marketplaces, mobile banks, and credit scoring. Crowdfunding is a way of raising money through the collective effort of family, friends, individual investors, and customers. This method taps into the collective efforts of many people—primarily online through crowdfunding and social media platforms. Nonprofits use crowdfunding to gather donations. They often refer to crowdfunding as "online fundraising," "social media fundraising," or "peer-to-peer fundraising." Some of the largest crowdfunding fintechs to date include KickStarter, CrowdCube, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe.

Kickstarter launched in 2009 with the aim to find "a new way to fund and follow creativity." KickStarter is much loved by arts and music entrepreneurs who want to get their creative project off the ground. Crowdcube started as a startup-oriented, equity crowdfunding platform, which means it gives people the chance to buy equity in the businesses on the site in exchange for investment. It now has expanded this offering to two different types of investment opportunity: equity and mini-bonds. Indiegogo, the world's biggest crowdfunding site, has launched more than 800,000 campaigns across 235 countries since 2008. These range from filmand arts-based campaigns to young startup businesses. GoFundMe, founded in 2010, is a crowdfunding platform that allows people to raise money for events ranging from celebrations and graduations to challenging circumstances like accidents and illnesses.

Lending marketplaces, also called peer-to-peer (P2P) lending or online platform lending, are part of a nonbank lending industry that makes loans to consumers and small businesses. Although marketplace lending is small compared to traditional lending, it has grown quickly in recent years. In general, marketplace lenders accept applications for small, unsecured loans online and determine applicants' creditworthiness using an automated algorithm. Often, the loans are then sold—individually or in pieces—directly to investors (although holding the loans on their own balance sheet is not uncommon). Prominent fintechs in the space include LendingClub, OnDeck, Avant, GreenSky, Kabbage, and SoFi.

# Investment Management Services

Fintechs in the investment management services space provide solutions for high-frequency trading, copy trading, e-trading, and robo-advice. Advancements in trading technologies made very rapid placements of buy and sell orders possible. Trades can now be executed in micro-seconds, faster than a blink of an eye. As a result, HFT has become widespread, especially in equity markets. According to the TABB Group (www.tabbbgroup.com), a securities market research firm, HFT was estimated to have accounted for 21 percent of all U.S. equity market volume in 2005. HFT market share increased to an all-time high of 61 percent in 2009, with aggregate revenues of \$7.2 billion. However, following the financial crisis, the rise of HFT came to a halt, and its market share started to recede. In 2018, HFT accounted for little over 50 percent of daily trading volume, with aggregate revenues of below \$1 billion.

Teza Technologies, a pioneer of electronic markets, sold its high-speed trading business to Quantlab Financial after conditions soured in the once-lucrative sector in March 2017. The deal came as proprietary trading companies were finding it increasingly difficult to compete on speed alone.[61] In July 2017, Virtu Financial Inc. (VIRT) acquired the rival firm KCG Holdings Inc. in a cash transaction valued at  \$20 per KCG share, or a total of approximately\$ 1.4 billion. The deal brought together the two largest players in the U.S. electronic trading space. Now, HFT companies are looking to invest in new techniques to recapture their edge. Much of this is focused on big data analytics, AI, and machine learning.

Copy trading allows millions of individuals trade FX on platforms such as Trade360, FxPro, Tradeo, eToro, ZuluTrade, and TradingFloor. eToro was founded in 2006 and www.wealthfront.com

launched its social investment platform and "copy trading" feature in 2010. eToro has seen significant growth to its user base. By 2013, after a number of million-dollar funding rounds, eToro had 3 million registered users. By the end of 2017, 8 million investors had opened accounts with the platform. In principle, social FX trading enables traders to augment the knowledge they have gleaned from their own research with insight into the strategies of successful traders, thus helping them to make better decisions. In practice, though, many traders are simply and unthinkingly copying the moves made by individuals they identify as "successful."

Robo-advisors are online services that use algorithms to automatically perform many investment tasks done by a human financial advisor. Initially offered by startups, robo-advisors are now part of the suite of services offered by major financial institutions such as Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity. Because they are less expensive than a human advisor, they democratize access to financial advice. Robo-advisors can take on customers with little savings since adding one more person wouldn't cost much more. Two early startups in this space were Wealthfront and Betterment. Robo-advisors are best for investors who are comfortable using a digital interface with minimal to no human contact. That means most robo-advisors are focused on millennials and Gen Xers. Through their use of robo-advising, fintechs have been able to dramatically lower costs in the industry. While traditional wealth management firms charge clients a fee of 1 percent or more of the assets being managed, robo-advisors can charge between 0.15 percent and 0.35 percent.

# REGULATORY APPROACHES TO FINTECH

So far, fintech firms currently represent a relatively small portion of the global banking services market. Regionally, however, some fintech companies already provide a considerable part of local banking services (e.g., M-Pesa in Kenya and Tanzania and AliPay in China). Even though technological innovations tend to follow the "hype cycle," this does not necessarily mean that fintech will have no lasting effect. For example, when then dotcom bubble burst in 2001, it seemed to blow away the promise of the Internet as a major marketplace. But today, the Internet has become a major platform for business.

# Fintech Charters and Other Licenses

# fintech charter

A special-purpose bank charter for nonbank fintech companies to operate in the banking system providing preemption from many state laws. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) fintech charter would allow a fintech to become a special-purpose national bank that can pay checks or lend money, but the institution cannot take deposits nor can it use FDIC insurance.

Regulators have lowered barriers in forms of virtual bank licenses, fintech charters, and e-money licenses. For example, fintech regulatory sandboxes have been spreading rapidly in various countries. A regulatory sandbox is a framework set up by a financial regulator to allow early-stage fintech startups to test out their offerings in a controlled environment under the regulator's supervision. In 2015, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched the first regulatory sandbox for fintech startups. Fintech sandboxes are now at various stages of development and implementation in countries including Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, and United Arab Emirates.

In the United States, Arizona became the first state to launch a fintech sandbox in March 2018. Unlike the FCA's six-month program, Arizona is giving companies two years to test their fintech offerings. At that point, they can apply for a license to operate as a money services business. If that is granted, it is then relatively easy to apply for a license in the 16 other states that have signed up to an agreement that standardizes key elements of the licensing process. These include Texas and Illinois but not such key states as New York and California.

In September 2018, the Bank of Lithuania launched its regulatory sandbox, seeking fintech startups. Startups can obtain an e-money or payment license in just three months (four if the preparation stage is included), which is two to three times faster than in other EU jurisdictions. Additionally, initial capital requirements for bank licenses are five times lower than in other EU countries. According to Invest Lithuania, the number of fintech companies in Lithuania rose from 117 to 170 in 2018, and there are now around 2,600

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The world's strongest set of data protection rules, which enhance how people can access information about them and places limits on what organizations can do with personal data.

# Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2)

A European regulation for electronic payment services. It seeks to make payments more secure in Europe, boost innovation, and help banking services adapt to new technologies.

specialists employed in the industry.[62] The Bank of Lithuania has now issued 3 Specialized Banking Licenses (SPBs), 33 Payment Institution licenses (PIs), and a massive 47 Electronic Money Institution licenses (EMIs). To put this into context, Luxembourg, also regarded as a fintech hub, has issued seven EMIs. The highest-profile companies to receive licenses in 2018 were UK-based Revolut, a fintech valued at €1.6 billion, and Google. The Bank of Lithuania issued Revolut with both a SPB and an EMI license for use across the EU, while Google Payment Lithuania, part of Alphabet Inc., received an EMI License.

On July 31, 2018, the U.S. Treasury released its 223-page report on nonbank financials, fintech, and innovation.[63] The Treasury fintech report includes a recommendation that the OCC establish a special-purpose national bank charter for fintech firms. On the same day, the OCC announced that it was accepting applications for special-purpose national bank charters from fintechs.[64] This charter would enable fintechs to engage in the core banking functions of paying checks or lending money but not taking deposits. Fintech special-purpose national banks will be subject to bank capital, liquidity, and financial inclusion commitments, as well as all the rest of the bank compliance scheme. But the most important benefit of the charter for potential fintech applicants—direct access to the Federal Reserve's payments system—isn't guaranteed.

Plus, to challenge the OCC's decision to allow online payment companies and lenders to have national bank charters, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) are suing the federal government. Due to these uncertainties, the fintech charter so far has only a handful of applicants. Some fintech firms, such as international money transfer company TransferWise, have voiced concern about access to the Fed system because current rules require members to accept deposits. On January 16, 2019, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said that fintech firms considering a federal banking charter shouldn't worry about gaining access to the Federal Reserve payments system.[65] Otting sees federally chartered fintech firms as having some form of access to the Fed's payments system or its discount borrowing rates—even though the central bank has never directly addressed the issue.

Overall, regulators in the United States have yet to come up with a comprehensive regulatory policy toward fintech innovation and have largely protected legacy incumbents. In October 2019, a federal judge ruled that the OCC did not have the authority to issue banking charters to fintech startups—a significant setback for the sector.

# International Regulations

Two significant changes to European Union (EU) regulations have given the fintech industry a major shot in the arm and strengthened its position as a competitor to traditional banking. Along with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gave citizens the right to control the use of personally identifiable information, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) required the sharing of consumer banking data with third parties when authorized by the customer. PSD2 is about creating access to personal data, while GDPR is about protecting it.

In 2016, the EU adopted the GDPR. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, which was adopted at a time when the Internet was in its infancy. The GDPR is now recognized as law across the EU. Member states had two years to ensure that it is fully implementable in their countries by May 25, 2018. GDPR's provisions require that any personal data exported outside the EU is protected and regulated. One result of the GDPR is that businesses will have access to honestly sourced data from consumers using a transparent

The purpose of PSD2, which was passed in 2015, was to regulate the emerging payment services industry and increase competition by allowing participation by nonbanks, such as fintech companies. It came into force in January 13, 2018. For fintechs this is a crucial issue since the directive provides the basis of a new marketplace for them through the use of the existing banking and payment infrastructures. The directive also considers the significant operational changes for all payment service providers, not least for the security of online payments and the protection of customers' financial data.

The Open Banking phenomenon emerged from PSD2, which forced the EU's and UK's biggest banks to release their data in a secure, standardized form so that it can be shared more easily among authorized organizations online. The data include some simple records, such as the location of branches and the exact details of certain banking products. Open banking should make it easier to find banks with disabled access, for instance, or compare the features of different personal and business accounts in order to get the best deal. The more important release concerns the data contained in transactions. Banks hold the authoritative record of everything we spend, lend, and borrow—everything from electricity bills to mortgage payments to weekly spending on train travel and coffee—but, for the most part, they don't make much use of it. Open Banking makes it possible to pass this rich information to third parties, who can use it to create new products.

Open Banking standards in the EU and the UK are friendly to fintech companies as they streamline access to a growing network of bank data. Fintechs within the United States must create individual data-sharing agreements with each bank partner, and the negotiations for each partnership can be resource intensive. However, in the EU, a fintech can get access to all bank APIs through registering as an account information service provider (AISP) or payment initiation service provider (PISP). This could create a situation where the United States may lose out on technology investments and see innovative financial professionals leave the nation to work in the rapidly advancing open-banking environment within the EU.

Overall, regulations in Europe are contributing to a rapidly-shifting market. More specifically, Open Banking and PSD2 have catalyzed the development of "fintech utilities"—such as Yapily and Tink—which provide financial APIs to help incumbent banks comply and compete.

66. Juniper Research, "3 Disruptive Fintech Technologies to Watch in 2018," June 2018. https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/3-disruptive-fintech-to-watch-in-2018

This chapter described the evolution of financial technology (fintech), various factors contributing to the recent emergence of fintech, the changing nature of the relationship between incumbent FIs and fintech firms, the types of fintech innovations, and regulatory approaches to fintech. While technological innovations have long been an essential part of the financial services industry, they have not significantly threatened or disrupted the way FIs operated until recently. A perfect storm of various supply and demand factors following the 2008 global financial crisis led to the rapid adoption of fintech in recent years.

However, despite the dire predictions, incumbent FIs have stood their ground well against the disruptors. Outside of China and India, wave upon wave of fintechs have so far only made a minor dent in the walls of the formidable fortresses that the big banks have built. Compared to fintechs, banks have three "big Cs" on their side: customers, compliance, and capital. They have tens of millions of trusting customers who interact with them every day. They have decades of compliance experience and experienced legal teams. Banks have a close to zero cost of capital as well as large reserves and capital to write off losses. Advantages to having a bank charter also include access to stable, lower cost FDIC-insured deposits, direct payment system access, ability to operate across state boundaries under a single regulatory framework, and emergency borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. In contrast, fintechs generally have much higher cost of capital. Fintech consumers and investors have less protection, exposing them to greater financial risks, cyber-risks, and data privacy risks. Nevertheless, with the nimble, innovative, and digital-first fintechs finding progressively greater capital investment and regulatory support in most markets, the threat has continued to grow, and not investing in digital transformation is no longer an option for FIs.
