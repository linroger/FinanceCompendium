## WHY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEED TO MANAGE RISK: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

As has been mentioned in previous chapters, a major objective of FI management is to increase the FI's returns for its owners. This often comes, however, at the cost of increased risk. As discussed in Chapter 12, regulators' evaluation of the overall safety and soundness of a depository institution (DI) is summarized in the CAMELS rating assigned to the DI. This chapter provides an overview of the various risks facing FIs: credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market risk, off-balance-sheet risk, foreign exchange risk, country or sovereign risk, technology risk, operational risk, fintech risk, and insolvency risk. Table 20-1 presents a brief definition of each of these risks. As will become clear, the effective management of these risks is central to an FI's performance. Indeed, it can be argued that the main business of FIs is to manage these risks. As a result, FI managers must devote significant time to understanding and managing the various risks to which their FIs are exposed. By the end of this chapter, you will have a basic understanding of the variety and complexity of the risks facing managers of modern FIs. In the remaining chapters of the text, we look at the management of the most important of these risks in more detail.

## TABLE 20-1 Risks Faced by Financial Institutions

1. Credit risk—the risk that promised cash flows from loans and securities held by FIs may not be paid in full.
2. Liquidity risk—the risk that a sudden and unexpected increase in liability withdrawals may require an FI to liquidate assets in a very short period of time and at low prices.
3. Interest rate risk—the risk incurred by an FI when the maturities of its assets and liabilities are mismatched and interest rates are volatile.
4. Market risk—the risk incurred in trading assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and other asset prices.
5. Off-balance-sheet risk—the risk incurred by an FI as the result of its activities related to contingent assets and liabilities.
6. Foreign exchange risk—the risk that exchange rate changes can affect the value of an FI's assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
7. Country or sovereign risk—the risk that repayments by foreign borrowers may be interrupted because of interference from foreign governments or other political entities.
8. Technology risk—the risk incurred by an FI when its technological investments do not produce anticipated cost savings.
9. Operational risk—the risk that existing technology or support systems may malfunction, that fraud that impacts the FI's activities may occur, and/or that external shocks such as hurricanes and floods may occur.
10. Fintech risk—the risk that fintech firms could disrupt business of financial services firms in the form of lost customers and lost revenue.
11. Insolvency risk—the risk that an FI may not have enough capital to offset a sudden decline in the value of its assets relative to its liabilities.

## CREDIT RISK

### credit risk

The risk that the promised cash flows from loans and securities held by FIs may not be paid in full.

Credit risk arises because of the possibility that promised cash flows on financial claims held by FIs, such as loans and bonds, will not be paid in full. Virtually all types of FIs face this risk. However, in general, FIs that make loans or buy bonds with long maturities are more exposed than are FIs that make loans or buy bonds with short maturities. This means, for example, that depository institutions and life insurers are more exposed to credit risk than are money market mutual funds and property-casualty insurers, since depository institutions and life insurers tend to hold longer maturity assets in their portfolios than mutual funds and property-casualty insurers. For example, commercial and investment banks incurred billions of dollars of losses in the midand late 2000s as a result of credit risk on subprime mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. If the principal on all financial claims held by FIs were paid in full on maturity and interest payments were made on their promised payment dates, FIs would always receive back the original principal lent plus an interest return—that is, they would face no credit risk. Should a borrower default, however, both the principal loaned and the interest payments expected to be received are at risk.

Many financial claims issued by individuals or corporations and held by FIs promise a limited or fixed upside return (principal and interest payments to the lender) with a high probability, but they also may result in a large downside risk (loss of loan principal and promised interest) with a much smaller probability. Some examples of financial claims issued with these return-risk trade-offs are fixed-coupon bonds issued by corporations and bank loans. In both cases, an FI holding these claims as assets earns the coupon on the bond or the interest promised on the loan if no borrower default occurs. In the event of default, however, the FI earns zero interest on the asset and may well lose all or part of the principal lent, depending on its ability to lay claim to some of the borrower's assets through legal bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, a key role of FIs involves screening and monitoring loan applicants to ensure that FI managers fund the most creditworthy loans (see Chapter 21).

### EXAMPLE 20-1 Impact of Credit Risk on an FI's Equity Value

Consider an FI with the following balance sheet:

<table><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$ 20m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>\$ 90m</td></tr><tr><td>Gross loans</td><td>80m</td><td>Equity (net worth)</td><td>10m</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$100m</td><td></td><td>$100m</td></tr></table>

Suppose that the managers of the FI recognize that  \$5 million of its\$ 80 million in loans is unlikely to be repaid due to an increase in credit repayment difficulties of its borrowers. Eventually, the FI's managers must respond by charging off or writing down the value of these loans on the FI's balance sheet. This means that the value of loans falls from \$80 million to \$75 million, an economic loss that must be charged off against the stockholder's equity capital or net worth (i.e., equity capital falls from \$10 million to \$5 million). Thus, both sides of the balance sheet shrink by the amount of the loss:

<table><tr><td>Cash</td><td></td><td>$20m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$90m</td></tr><tr><td>Gross loans</td><td>80m</td><td></td><td>Equity after charge-off</td><td>5m</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Loan loss</td><td>-5m</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Loans after charge-off</td><td></td><td>75m</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>$95m</td><td></td><td>$95m</td></tr></table>

The effects of credit risk are evident in Figures 20-1 and 20-2, which show commercial bank charge-off (or write-off) rates (loans charged off as a percentage of total

loans) for various types of loans between 1984 and 2019. Notice, in particular, the high rate of charge-offs experienced on credit card loans throughout this period. Indeed, credit card charge-offs by commercial banks increased persistently from the mid-1980s until late 1993 and again from 1995 through early 1998. While high relative to real estate and commercial and industrial (C&I) loan charge-off rates, by 1999, credit card charge-offs leveled off, and they even declined after 1999. With the downturn in the U.S. economy and an impending change in bankruptcy laws making it more difficult to declare bankruptcy, credit card charge-offs rose rapidly in 2001 and remained high through 2004. Note particularly that in October 2005, the Bankruptcy Reform Act was signed into law. This act makes it more difficult for consumers to declare bankruptcy. As a result, there was a surge in bankruptcy filings in the summer and early fall of 2005 just before the new rules went into effect and a huge drop-off in bankruptcy filings just after the enactment of the new rules. The financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the resulting economic recession produced a huge surge in credit card charge-off rates, which rose to an all-time high of 13.21 percent in March 2010. Despite these losses, credit card loans (including unused balances) extended by commercial banks continued to grow, from  \$1.856 trillion in March 1997 to\$ 4.367 trillion in September 2008. As of June 2019, credit card loans extended by commercial banks totaled 4.180 trillion.

Even as losses due to credit risk increase, financial institutions continue to willingly give loans. This is because the FI charges a rate of interest on a loan that compensates for the risk of the loan. Thus, an important element in the credit risk management process is its pricing. Further, the potential loss an FI can experience from lending suggests that FIs need to collect information about borrowers whose assets are in their portfolios and to monitor those borrowers over time. Thus, managerial (monitoring) efficiency and credit risk management strategies directly affect the returns and risks of the loan portfolio. Moreover, one of the advantages that FIs have over individual investors is their ability to diversify credit risk exposures from a single asset by exploiting the law of large numbers in their asset investment portfolios. Diversification across assets, such as loans exposed to credit risk, reduces the overall credit risk in the asset portfolio and thus increases the probability of partial or full repayment of principal and/or interest. In particular, diversification reduces individual firm-specific credit risk, such as the risk specific to holding the bonds

### systemic credit risk

The risk of default associated with general economywide or macroconditions affecting all borrowers.

or loans of General Motors, while still leaving the FI exposed to systemic credit risk, such as factors that simultaneously increase the default risk of all firms in the economy (e.g., an economic recession).

Chapter 21 describes methods to measure the default risk of individual bonds and loans and investigates methods to measure the risk of portfolios of such claims. Chapter 25 discusses various methods—for example, loan sales and loan reschedulings—used to manage and control credit risk exposures.

## LIQUIDITY RISK

### liquidity risk

The risk that a sudden and unexpected increase in liability withdrawals may require an FI to liquidate assets in a very short period of time and at low prices.

Liquidity risk arises when an FI's liability holders, such as depositors or insurance policyholders, demand immediate cash for the financial claims they hold with an FI or when holders of off-balance-sheet loan commitments (or credit lines) suddenly exercise their right to borrow (draw down their loan commitments). For example, when liability holders demand cash immediately—that is, "put" their financial claim back to the FI—the FI must either liquidate assets or borrow additional funds to meet the demand for the withdrawal of funds. On the asset side of the balance sheet, loan requests and the exercise by borrowers of their loan commitments and other credit lines causes liquidity risk. The most liquid asset of all is cash, which FIs can use directly to meet liability holders' demands to withdraw funds. Although FIs limit their cash asset holdings because cash earns no interest, low cash holdings are generally not a problem. Day-to-day withdrawals by liability holders are generally predictable, and large FIs can normally expect to borrow additional funds to meet any sudden shortfalls of cash in the money and financial markets (see Chapter 23).

At times, however, FIs face a liquidity crisis. For example, because of a lack of confidence in an FI or some unexpected need for cash, liability holders may be led to demand larger withdrawals than usual. When all, or many, FIs face abnormally large cash demands, the cost of purchased or borrowed funds rises and the supply of such funds becomes restricted. As a consequence, FIs may have to sell some of their less liquid assets to meet the withdrawal demands of liability holders. This results in a more serious liquidity risk, especially as some assets with "thin" markets generate lower prices when the sale is immediate than when an FI has more time to negotiate the sale of an asset. As a result, the liquidation of some assets at low or "fire-sale" prices (the price the FI receives if the assets must be liquidated immediately at less than their fair market value) could threaten an FI's profitability and solvency. For example, in the summer of 2008, IndyMac bank failed in part due to a bank run that continued for several days, even after being taken over by the FDIC. The bank had announced on July 7 that, due to its deteriorating capital position, its mortgage operations would stop and it would operate only as a retail bank. News reports over the weekend highlighted the possibility that IndyMac would become the largest bank failure in over 20 years. Worried that they would not have access to their money, bank depositors rushed to withdraw money from IndyMac even though their deposits were insured up to 100,000 by the FDIC.[2] The run was so large that within a week of the original announcement, the FDIC had to step in and take over the bank.

# EXAMPLE 20-2 Impact of Liquidity Risk on an FI's Equity Value

Consider the simple FI balance sheet in Table 20-2. Before deposit withdrawals, the FI has  \$10 million in cash assets and\$ 90 million in nonliquid assets (such as small business loans). These assets were funded with \$90 million in deposits and \$10 million in owner's equity. Suppose that depositors unexpectedly withdraw \$15 million in deposits (perhaps due to the release of negative news about the profits of the FI) and the FI receives no new deposits to replace them. To meet these deposit withdrawals, the FI first uses the \$10 million it has in cash assets and then seeks to sell some of its nonliquid assets to raise an additional \$5 million in cash. Assume that the FI cannot borrow any more funds in the short-term money markets (see Chapter 5), and because it cannot wait to get better prices for its assets in the future (as it needs the cash now to meet immediate depositor withdrawals), the FI has to sell any nonliquid assets at 50 cents on the dollar. Thus, to cover the remaining \$5 million in deposit withdrawals, the FI must sell \$10 million in nonliquid assets, incurring a loss of \$5 million from the face value of those assets. The FI must then write off any such losses against its capital or equity funds. Since its capital was only \$10 million before the deposit withdrawal, the loss on the fire sale of assets of \$5 million leaves the FI with 5 million.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

3. Why an FI might face a sudden liquidity crisis?
4. What circumstances might lead an FI to liquidate assets at fire-sale prices?

Chapter 22 examines the nature of normal, abnormal, and run-type liquidity risks and their impact on banks, thrifts, insurance companies, and other FIs in more detail. In addition, it looks at ways in which an FI can measure liquidity risk and better manage liquidity and liability risk exposures. Recall that Chapter 13 discussed the roles of deposit insurance and other liability guarantees in deterring deposit or other liability runs in depository institutions.

# INTEREST RATE RISK

# interest rate risk

The risk incurred by an FI when the maturities of its assets and liabilities are mismatched and interest rates are volatile.

Chapter 1 discussed asset transformation as a special or key function of FIs. Asset transformation involves an FI buying primary securities or assets and issuing secondary securities or liabilities to fund the assets. The primary securities that FIs purchase often have maturity characteristics different from the secondary securities that FIs sell. In mismatching the maturities of its assets and liabilities as part of its asset transformation function, an FI potentially exposes itself to interest rate risk.

# EXAMPLE 20-3 Impact of an Interest Rate Increase on an FI's Profit When the Maturity of Assets Exceeds the Maturity of Liabilities

Consider an FI that issues  \$100 million of liabilities with one year to maturity to finance the purchase of\$ 100 million of assets with a two-year maturity. We show this in the following time lines:

# refinancing risk

The risk that the cost of rolling over or reborrowing funds will rise above the returns being earned on asset investments.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/f1f3e58e-94c9-4056-b1f0-68f9b5365a8f/8d13bd05b8a4016fab10081d0bf008c3364f5344164126d0b35ca2dc486641c5.jpg)

Suppose that the cost of funds (liabilities) for the FI is 9 percent in year 1 and the interest return on the assets is 10 percent per year. Over the first year, the FI can lock in a profit spread of 1 percent (10 percent - 9 percent) times  \$100 million by borrowing short term (for one year) and lending long term (for two years). Thus, its profit is\$ 1 million (0.01 × 100m).

Its profit for the second year, however, is uncertain. If the level of interest rates does not change, the FI can refinance its liabilities at 9 percent and lock in a 1 percent or \$1 million profit for the second year as well. The risk always exists, however, that interest rates will change between years 1 and 2. If interest rates rise and the FI can borrow new one-year liabilities at only 11 percent in the second year, its profit spread in the second year is actually negative; that is, 10 percent – 11 percent = -1 percent, or the FI loses \$1 million (-0.01 × 100m). The positive spread earned in the first year by the FI from holding assets with a longer maturity than its liabilities is offset by a negative spread in the second year. Note that if interest rates were to rise by more than 2 percent in the second year, the FI would stand to make losses over the two-year period as a whole. As a result, when an FI holds longer-term assets relative to liabilities, it potentially exposes itself to refinancing risk. Refinancing risk is a type of interest rate risk in that the cost of refinancing can be more than the return earned on asset investments. As interest rates rose in the mid-2010s, good examples of this exposure were provided by banks that borrowed short-term deposits (deposits whose interest rates changed or adjusted frequently), while investing in fixed-rate loans (loans whose interest rates changed or adjusted infrequently).

# EXAMPLE 20-4 Impact of an Interest Rate Decrease on an FI's Profit When the Maturity of Liabilities Exceeds the Maturity of Assets

An alternative balance sheet structure would have the FI borrowing  \$100 million for a longer term than the\$ 100 million of assets in which it invests. This is shown as follows:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/f1f3e58e-94c9-4056-b1f0-68f9b5365a8f/76e98f36e0200f9252381ce4a55b52437cf17e4ef2a08a77cc33baf3744c00d2.jpg)

In this case, the FI is also exposed to interest rate risk; by holding shorter-term assets relative to liabilities, it faces uncertainty about the interest rate at which it can reinvest funds in the second year. As before, suppose that the cost of funds for the FI is 9 percent per year over the two years and the interest rate on assets is 10 percent in the first year. Over the first year, the FI can lock in a profit spread of 1 percent, or \$1 million. If in the second year interest rates on \$100 million invested in new one-year assets decreases to

# reinvestment risk

The risk that the returns on funds to be reinvested will fall below the cost of funds.

8 percent, the FI's profit spread is negative 1 percent (8 percent – 9 percent), or the FI loses \$1 million (-0.01 × \$100m). The positive spread earned in the first year by the FI from holding assets with a shorter maturity than its liabilities is offset by a negative spread in the second year. Thus, the FI is exposed to reinvestment risk; by holding shorter-term assets relative to liabilities, it faces uncertainty about the interest rate at which it can reinvest funds borrowed over a longer period. In recent years, good examples of this exposure are banks operating in the Euromarkets that have borrowed fixed-rate deposits while investing in floating-rate loans—loans whose interest rates are changed or adjusted frequently.

# price risk

The risk that the price of the security will change when interest rates change.

In addition to a potential refinancing or reinvestment effect, an FI faces price risk or market value uncertainty as well when interest rates change. Remember that the economic or fair market value of an asset or liability is conceptually equal to the present value of the current and future cash flows on that asset or liability. Therefore, rising interest rates increase the discount rate on future asset (liability) cash flows and reduce the market price or present value of that asset or liability. Conversely, falling interest rates increase the present value of the cash flows from assets and liabilities. Moreover, mismatching maturities by holding longer-term assets than liabilities means that when interest rates rise, the economic or present value of the FI's assets falls by a larger amount than its liabilities. This exposes the FI to the risk of economic loss and potentially to the risk of insolvency. Unlike refinancing or reinvestment risk, market value risk reflects economic reality or the true values of assets and liabilities if the FI's portfolio were to be liquidated at today's securities prices rather than at the prices when the assets and liabilities were originally purchased or sold. Today's security prices reflect the current level of interest rates—and thus, time value of money—affecting the present value of future cash flows on a security and not the historic level of interest rates at the time the security was issued, which may have been higher or lower resulting in a higher or lower price for the security. Further, market value risk considers the degree of leverage on an FI's balance sheet as well as the timing of the payment or arrival of cash flows on assets and liabilities.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

5. What refinancing risk is?
6. Why a rise in the level of interest rates adversely affects the market value of both assets and liabilities?
7. What the concept of maturity matching means?

If holding assets and liabilities with mismatched maturities exposes FIs to interest rate risk, FIs can seek to hedge or protect themselves against interest rate risk by matching the maturity of their assets and liabilities. This has resulted in the general philosophy that matching maturities is somehow the best policy for FIs averse to risk. Note, however, that matching maturities is not necessarily consistent with an active asset transformation function for FIs. That is, FIs cannot be asset transformers (i.e., transforming short-term deposits into long-term loans) and direct balance sheet matchers or hedgers at the same time. Although it does reduce exposure to interest rate risk, matching maturities may reduce the FI's profitability because returns from acting as specialized risk-bearing asset transformers are reduced. As a result, some FIs emphasize asset-liability maturity mismatching more than others. For example, depository institutions traditionally hold longer-term assets than liabilities, whereas life insurers tend to match the long-term nature of their liabilities with long-term assets. Finally, matching maturities hedges interest rate risk only in a very approximate rather than complete fashion. The reasons for this are technical, relating to the difference between the average life (or duration) and maturity of an asset or liability and whether the FI partly funds its assets with equity capital as well as liabilities. In the preceding simple examples, the FI financed its assets completely with borrowed funds. In the real world, FIs use a mix of liabilities and stockholders' equity to finance asset purchases. When assets and liabilities are not equal, hedging risk (i.e., insulating FIs' stockholder's equity values) may be achieved by not exactly matching the maturities (or average lives) of assets and liabilities (see Chapter 23). We discuss the causes of interest rate risk and methods used to measure interest rate risk in detail in Chapter 23. We discuss the instruments and methods to hedge interest rate risk in Chapters 10 and 24.

3. This assumes that FIs can directly "control" the maturity of their assets and liabilities. As interest rates fall, many mortgage borrowers seek to "prepay" their existing loans and refinance at a lower rate. This prepayment risk—which is directly related to interest rate movements—can be viewed as a further interest rate-related risk (see Chapters 7 and 25).

# MARKET RISK

# market risk

The risk incurred in trading assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and other asset prices.

Market risk arises when FIs actively trade assets and liabilities (and derivatives) rather than holding them for longer-term investment, funding, or hedging purposes. Market risk is closely related to interest rate and foreign exchange risk in that as these risks increase or decrease, the overall risk of the FI is affected. However, market risk adds another dimension of risk: trading activity. Market risk is the incremental risk incurred by an FI when interest rate and foreign exchange risks are combined with an active trading strategy, especially one that involves short trading horizons such as a day.

Conceptually, an FI's trading portfolio can be differentiated from its investment portfolio on the basis of time horizon and liquidity. The trading portfolio contains assets, liabilities, and derivative contracts that can be quickly bought or sold on organized financial markets. The investment portfolio (or in the case of banks, the "banking book") contains assets and liabilities that are relatively illiquid and held for longer periods. Table 20-3 shows a hypothetical breakdown between banking book and trading book assets and liabilities. Note that capital produces a cushion against losses on either the banking or trading books (see Chapter 23). As can be seen, the banking book contains the majority of loans and deposits plus other illiquid assets. The trading book contains long and short positions in instruments such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange, equities, and derivatives.

As discussed in Chapters 11 through 19, the traditional roles of many financial institutions have changed in recent years. For example, for large commercial banks such as money center banks, the decline in income from traditional deposit taking and lending activities has been matched by an increased reliance on income from trading. Similarly, the decline in underwriting and brokerage income for large investment banks has also been met by more active and aggressive trading in securities, derivatives, and other assets. Mutual fund managers, who actively manage their asset portfolios, are also exposed to market risk. Of course, with time, every asset and liability can be sold. While bank regulators have normally viewed tradable assets as those being held for horizons of less than one year, private FIs take an even shorter-term view. In particular, FIs are concerned about the fluctuation in value—or value at risk (VAR)—of their trading account assets and liabilities for periods as short as one day—so-called daily earnings at risk (DEAR)—especially if such fluctuations pose a threat to their solvency.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

8. What market risk is?
9. What conditions have led to an increase in market risk for FIs?

An extreme case of market risk is the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Investment banks and securities firms were major purchasers and traders of mortgages in the early 2000s, which allowed them to increase their business of packaging the loans as mortgage-backed securities. Rising mortgage interest rates in the mid-2000s resulted in significant increases in mortgage defaults. As mortgage borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, the securitized mortgage market froze and FIs were left holding these "toxic" assets at deeply reduced market values. By mid-September 2008, financial markets had frozen. FIs stopped lending to each other at anything but exorbitantly high rates, and some mark-to-market

securities had to be priced in some cases using asset pricing models rather than trades because trades did not take place. FIs that were active traders faced extreme market risk.

The financial market crisis illustrates trading or market risk—the risk that when an FI takes an open or unhedged long (buy) or short (sell) position in bonds, equities, commodities, and derivatives, prices may change in a direction opposite to that expected. As a result, as the volatility of asset prices increases, the market risks faced by FIs that adopt open trading positions increase. This requires FI management (and regulators) to establish controls or limits on positions taken by traders as well as to develop models to measure the market risk exposure of an FI on a day-to-day basis.

# OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

# off-balance-sheet risk

The risk incurred by an FI as the result of activities related to contingent assets and liabilities.

# contingent assets and liabilities

Assets and liabilities off the balance sheet that potentially can produce positive or negative future cash flows for an FI.

# letter of credit

A credit guarantee issued by an FI for a fee on which payment is contingent on some future event occurring, most notably default of the agent that purchases the letter of credit.

One of the most striking trends involving FIs has been the growth in their off-balance-sheet (OBS) activities and thus, their off-balance-sheet risks. The value of on-balance-sheet items for commercial banks in 2019 was  \$16.457 trillion, while the face or notional value of their off-balance-sheet derivative items was\$ 204.874 trillion. Although all FIs to some extent engage in off-balance-sheet activities, most attention has been drawn to the activities of banks, especially large banks that invest heavily in off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities, particularly derivative securities. Off-balance-sheet activities have been less of a concern to smaller depository institutions and many insurers. An off-balance-sheet activity, by definition, does not appear on an FI's current balance sheet since it does not involve holding a current primary claim (asset) or the issuance of a current secondary claim (liability). Instead, off-balance-sheet activities affect the future, rather than the current, shape of an FI's balance sheet. They involve the creation of contingent assets and liabilities that give rise to their potential placement in the future on the balance sheet. As such, they have a direct impact on the FI's future profitability and performance. Thus, accountants place them "below the bottom line" on an FI's balance sheet.

An example of an off-balance-sheet activity is the issuance of standby letter of credit guarantees by insurance companies and banks to back the issuance of municipal bonds. Many state and local governments could not issue such securities without bank or insurance company letter of credit guarantees that promise principal and interest payments to investors should the municipality default on its obligations in the future. Thus, the letter of credit guarantees payment should a municipal government (e.g., New York State) face financial problems in paying either the promised interest and/or principal payments on the bonds it issues. If a municipal government's cash flow is sufficiently strong to pay off the principal and interest on the debt it issues, the letter of credit guarantee issued by the FI expires unused. Nothing appears on the FI's balance sheet today or in the future. However, the fee earned for issuing the letter of credit guarantee appears on the FI's income statement (see Chapter 12).

The ability to earn fee income while not loading up or expanding the balance sheet has become an important motivation for FIs to pursue off-balance-sheet business. Unfortunately, this activity is not risk free. Off-balance-sheet securities played a prominent role in the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. According to critics, these securities hid the underlying risk in mortgage investments because the ratings on various securities, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), were based on misleading or incorrect information about the creditworthiness of the borrowers. For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent in these financial innovations or understand their potential impact on the overall stability of the financial system. For example, the pricing model for CMOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. During the financial crisis, the average recovery rate for "high-quality" CMOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for "low-quality" CMOs was approximately five cents for every dollar. These huge losses dramatically impacted the balance sheets of FIs worldwide, leaving them with very little capital to continue operations. As off-balance-sheet financial assets

became more and more complex, and harder and harder to value, investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators, who came to rely on them, accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be in practice. In fact, the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. Similarly, the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products—a massive abdication of responsibility.

Letters of credit and CMOs are just two examples of off-balance-sheet activities. Others include loan commitments by banks, mortgage servicing contracts by depository institutions, and positions in forwards, futures, swaps, and other derivative securities by almost all large FIs. While some of these activities are structured to reduce an FI's exposure to credit, interest rate, or foreign exchange risks, mismanagement or speculative use of these instruments can result in major losses to FIs. Indeed, as seen during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, significant losses in off-balance-sheet activities (e.g., credit default swaps) can cause an FI to fail, just as major losses due to balance sheet default and interest rate risks can cause an FI to fail.

# EXAMPLE 20-5 Impact of Off-Balance-Sheet Risk on an FI's Equity Value

Consider Table 20-4. In Panel A, the value of the FI's net worth  $(E)$  is calculated in the traditional way as the difference between the market values of its on-balance-sheet assets  $(A)$  and liabilities  $(L)$ :

$$
E = A - L
$$

$$
1 0 = 1 0 0 - 9 0
$$

Under this calculation, the market value of the stockholders' equity stake in the FI is 10 and the ratio of the FI's capital to assets (or capital-to-assets ratio) is 10 percent. Regulators and FIs often use this ratio as a simple measure of solvency (see Chapter 13 for more details).

A more accurate picture of the FI's economic solvency should consider the market values of both its on-balance-sheet and OBS activities (Panel B of Table 20-4). Specifically, the FI manager should value contingent or future asset and liability claims as well as current assets and liabilities. In our example, the current market value of the FI's contingent assets  $(CA)$  is 50; the current market value of its contingent liabilities  $(CL)$  is 55. Since  $CL$  exceeds  $CA$  by 5, this difference is an additional obligation, or claim, on the

TABLE 20-4 Valuation of an FI's Net Worth with and without Consideration of Off-Balance-Sheet Activities

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Panel A: Traditional valuation of an FI&#x27;s net worth</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Market value of assets (A)</td><td>100</td><td>Market value of liabilities (L) 90</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Net worth (E) 10</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Panel B: Valuation of an FI&#x27;s net worth with onand off-balance-sheet activities valued</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Market value of assets (A)</td><td>100</td><td>Market value of liabilities (L) 90</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Net worth (E) 5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Market value of contingent assets (CA)</td><td>50</td><td>Market value of contingent liabilities (CL) 55</td></tr><tr><td>150</td><td></td></tr></table>

FI's net worth. That is, stockholders' true net worth  $(E)$  is really 5 rather than 10 when we ignored off-balance-sheet activities:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E = (A - L) + (C A - C L) \\ = (1 0 0 - 9 0) + (5 0 - 5 5) \\ = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, economically speaking, contingent assets and liabilities are contractual claims that directly impact the economic value of the equity holders' stake in an FI. Indeed, from both the stockholders' and regulators' perspectives, large increases in the value of OBS liabilities can render the FI economically insolvent just as effectively as losses due to mismatched interest rate gaps and default or credit losses from on-balance-sheet activities.

We detailed the specific nature of the risks of off-balance-sheet activities and instruments more fully in Chapter 12. We also look at how some of these instruments (forwards, futures, swaps, and options) can be used to manage risk in Chapter 24.

# FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/f1f3e58e-94c9-4056-b1f0-68f9b5365a8f/0ff575fee27b397810351decd2ad6d076167a1eeda0b79c5b97f85c85f66591a.jpg)

FIs have increasingly recognized that both direct foreign investment and foreign portfolio investment can extend the operational and financial benefits available from purely domestic investments. Thus, U.S. pension funds that held approximately 5 percent of their assets in foreign securities in the early 1990s now hold close to 24 percent of their assets in foreign securities. At the same time, many large U.S. banks, investment banks, and mutual funds have become more global in their orientation. To the extent that the returns on domestic and foreign investments are imperfectly correlated, FIs can reduce risk through domestic–foreign activity/investment diversification.

The returns on domestic and foreign direct investments and portfolio investments are not perfectly correlated for two reasons. The first is that the underlying technologies of various economies differ, as do the firms in those economies. For example, one economy may be agriculturally based and another industry based. Given different economic infrastructures, one economy could be expanding while another is contracting. The second reason is that exchange rate changes are not perfectly correlated across countries: the dollar–euro exchange rate may be appreciating while the dollar–yen exchange rate may be depreciating.

One potential benefit to an FI from becoming increasingly global in its outlook is an ability to expand abroad directly through branching or acquisitions or by indirectly developing a financial asset portfolio that includes foreign as well as domestic securities. Even so, foreign investment activities expose an FI to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk is the risk that exchange rate changes can adversely affect the value of an FI's assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

Chapter 9 introduced the basics of FX markets and risks by discussing how events in other countries affect an FI's return-risk opportunities. Foreign exchange risks can occur either directly as the result of trading in foreign currencies, making foreign currency loans (a loan in British pounds to a corporation), buying foreign-issued securities (British pound-denominated bonds or euro-denominated government bonds), or issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (British pound-denominated certificates of deposit) as a source of funds.

To understand how foreign exchange risk arises, suppose that a U.S. FI makes a loan to a British company in pounds (£). Should the British pound depreciate in value relative to the U.S. dollar, the principal and interest payments received by the U.S. FI would be devalued in dollar terms. Indeed, were the British pound to fall far enough over the investment period, when cash flows are converted back into dollars, the overall return could be negative. That is, on the conversion of principal and interest payments from pounds into dollars,

# foreign exchange risk

The risk that exchange rate changes can affect the value of an FI's assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

Figure 20-3 The Foreign Asset and Liability Position: A Net Long Asset Position in Pounds

In general, an FI can hold assets denominated in a foreign currency and/or issue foreign liabilities. Consider a U.S. FI that holds  $\pm 100$  million British pound loans as assets and funds  $\pm 80$  million of them with British pound certificates of deposit. The difference between the  $\pm 100$  million in pound loans and the  $\pm 80$  million in pound CDs is funded by dollar CDs (i.e.,  $\pm 20$  million pounds worth of dollar CDs). See Figure 20-3. In this case, the U.S. FI is net long  $\pm 20$  million in British assets. That is, it holds more foreign assets than liabilities. The U.S. FI suffers losses if the exchange rate for pounds falls or depreciates against the dollar over this period. In dollar terms, the value of the British pound loan assets falls or decreases in value by more than the British pound CD liabilities do. That is, the FI is exposed to the risk that its net foreign assets may have to be liquidated at an exchange rate lower than the one that existed when the FI entered into the foreign asset-liability position.

Instead, the FI could have £20 million more foreign liabilities than assets. In this case, it would be holding a net short position in foreign assets, as shown in Figure 20-4. Under this circumstance, the FI is exposed to foreign exchange risk if the pound appreciates against the dollar over the investment period. This occurs because the value of its British pound liabilities in dollar terms rose faster than the return on its pound assets. Consequently, to be approximately hedged, the FI must match its assets and liabilities in each foreign currency.

Note that the FI is fully hedged only if we assume that it holds foreign assets and liabilities of exactly the same maturity. Consider what happens if the FI matches the size of its foreign currency book (British pound assets = British pound liabilities = £100 million in that currency) but mismatches the maturities so that the pound assets are of six-month maturity and the liabilities are of three-month maturity. The FI would then be exposed to foreign interest rate risk—the risk that British interest rates would rise when it has to roll over its £100 million British CD liabilities at the end of the third month. Consequently, an FI that matches both the size and maturities of its exposures in assets and liabilities of a given currency is hedged or immunized against foreign currency and foreign interest rate risk. To the extent that FIs mismatch their portfolio and maturity exposures in different currency assets and liabilities, they face both foreign currency and foreign interest rate risks. As already noted, if foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes are not perfectly correlated across countries, an FI can diversify away part, if not all, of its foreign currency risk.

# country or sovereign risk

The risk that repayments from foreign borrowers may be interrupted because of interference from foreign governments.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

13. How an FI can be subject to sovereign risk even if it lends to the highest-quality foreign corporations?
14. How an FI can discipline a country that threatens not to repay its loans?

A globally oriented FI that mismatches the size and maturities of its foreign assets and liabilities is exposed to foreign currency risk. Even beyond this risk, and even when investing in dollars, holding assets in a foreign country can expose an FI to an additional type of foreign investment risk called country or sovereign risk. Country or sovereign risk is different from the type of credit risk that is faced by an FI that purchases domestic assets such as the bonds and loans of domestic corporations. For example, when a domestic corporation is unable or unwilling to repay a loan, an FI usually has recourse to the domestic bankruptcy court and eventually may recoup at least a portion of its original investment when the assets of the defaulted firm are liquidated or restructured. By comparison, a foreign corporation may be unable to repay the principal or interest on a loan even if it would like to do so. Most commonly, the government of the country in which the corporation is headquartered may prohibit or limit debt repayments due to foreign currency shortages and adverse political events. Thus, sovereign risk is a broader measure of the risk faced by FIs that operate abroad. Measuring such exposure or risk includes an analysis of macroeconomic issues such as trade policy, the fiscal stance (deficit or surplus) of the government, government intervention in the economy, its monetary policy, capital flows and foreign investment, inflation, and the structure of its financial system.

For example, in 2001 the government of Argentina, which had pegged its peso to the dollar on a one-to-one basis since the early 1990s, had to default on its government debt largely because of an overvalued peso and the adverse effect this had on its exports and foreign currency earnings. In December 2001 Argentina ended up defaulting on 130 billion in government-issued debt, and in 2002 it passed legislation that led to defaults on 30 billion of corporate debt owed to foreign creditors. Argentina's economic problems continued into the 2000s and even the 2010s. In September 2003, it defaulted on a 3 billion loan to the IMF, and in early 2018 Argentina was still asking for debt payment adjustments. Another case of extreme sovereign risk is the European crisis of the 2010s. Despite massive injections of bailout funds by Euro-zone countries and the International Monetary Fund, in March 2012 Greek government debtholders lost 53.5 percent of their 265 billion investment as Greece restructured much of its sovereign debt. The restructuring produced the largest-ever sovereign debt default.

In the event of restrictions or outright prohibitions on the payment of debt obligations by sovereign governments, the FI claimholder has little if any recourse to local bankruptcy courts or to an international civil claims court. The major leverage available to an FI, to ensure or increase repayment probabilities, is its control over the future supply of loans or funds to the country concerned. Such leverage may be very weak, however, in the face of a country's collapsing currency and government.

# TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISK www.bis.org

Technology and operational risks are closely related and in recent years have caused great concern to FI managers and regulators alike. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the principal organization of central banks in the major economies of the world, defines operational risk (inclusive of technological risk) as "the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events." A number of FIs add reputational risk and strategic risk (e.g., due to a failed merger) as part of a broader definition of operational risk.

Technological innovation has been a major concern of FIs in recent years (see Chapter 11). Banks, insurance companies, and investment companies have sought to

# technology risk

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

15. How operational risk is related to technology risk?
16. How technological expansion can help an FI better exploit economies of scale and economies of scope?

improve their operational efficiency with major investments in internal and external communications, computers, and an expanded technological infrastructure. For example, most banks provide depositors with the capabilities to check account balances, transfer funds between accounts, manage finances, pay bills, and more from their various personal electronic devices. At the wholesale level, electronic transfers of funds through the automated clearinghouses (ACHs) and wire transfer payment networks such as the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) have been developed. Indeed, a global financial service firm such as Citigroup has operations in more than 100 countries connected in real time by a proprietary satellite system.

The major objectives of technological expansion are to lower operating costs, increase profits, and capture new markets for an FI. In current terminology, the object is to allow the FI to exploit, to the fullest extent possible, potential economies of scale and economies of scope in selling its products (see Chapter 11). For example, an FI could use the same information on the quality of customers stored in its computers to expand the sale of both loan products and insurance products—the same information (e.g., age, job, size of family, or income) can identify both potential loan and life insurance customers.

Technology risk occurs when technological investments do not produce the anticipated cost savings in the form of either economies of scale or economies of scope. Dis economies of scale, for example, arise because of excess capacity, redundant technology, and/or organizational and bureaucratic inefficiencies that become worse as an FI grows in size. Diseconomies of scope arise when an FI fails to generate perceived synergies or cost savings through major new technological investments. Technology risk can result in major losses in an FI's competitive efficiency and ultimately result in its long-term failure. Similarly, gains from technological investments can produce performance superior to an FI's rivals as well as allow it to develop new and innovative products enhancing its long-term survival chances.

Operational risk is partly related to technology risk and can arise when existing technology malfunctions or "back-office" support systems break down. For example, in August 2018 the FBI sent out an alert to banks that cybercriminals were preparing to imminently carry out a global fraud scheme known as an "ATM cash-out." Cash-out means that thieves use a bank or payment card processor and clone cards at cash machines to potentially withdraw millions of dollars in a few hours. Just prior to executing the ATM cash-outs, cybercriminals remove many fraud controls at the financial institution, such as maximum ATM withdrawal amounts and any limits on the number of customer ATM transactions daily. The FBI urged banks to review how they were handling security, such as implementing strong password requirements and two-factor authentication using a physical or digital token when possible for local administrators and business critical roles. Another notable instance is that of Target Stores in 2013. Hackers infected the company's payment card readers, making off with 110 million records at the height of the Christmas shopping season. Even though such computer and data problems are rare, their occurrence can cause major dislocations for the FIs involved and potentially disrupt the financial system in general.

Operational risk is not exclusively the result of technological failure. Other sources of operational risk can result in direct costs (e.g., loss of income), indirect costs (e.g., client withdrawals and legal costs), and opportunity costs (e.g., forgone business opportunities) that reduce an FI's profitability and market value. A good example of operational risk involved 6.2 billion in losses incurred by JPMorgan Chase's trader, Bruno Iksil, also known as "the London Whale." Iksil took large credit default swap (CDS) positions in expectation that the financial crisis in Europe would cause anxiety in the financial markets. Instead, bailouts, austerity measures, and interventions prevented any major disruption from occurring in Europe. To maintain the proper balance and deal with expiring contracts, Iksil needed to continually make new trades. But the CDS market was too small and the amounts Iksil was trading were too large to let JPMorgan operate in secrecy. Once the story got out, hedge fund traders took positions designed to gain from the trades that Iksil had to make to keep the position going. That activity negatively altered prices on the CDSs that Iksil needed. Eventually the only choice was to close the CDS position and take the loss. Activities such as these by employees of FIs result in an overall loss of reputation and, in turn, a loss of business for FI employers. Indeed, the Federal Reserve defines reputational risk as the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution's business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. The Fed includes this type of operational risk as part of its principles of sound management in banking institutions.

# FINTECH RISK

# fintech risk

The risk that fintech firms could disrupt business of financial services firms in the form of lost customers and lost revenue.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

17. What fintech refers to?
18. How risk in fintech companies differs from that in traditional FIs?

Financial technology, or fintech, refers to the use of technology to deliver financial solutions in a manner that competes with traditional financial methods. While similar to technology risk discussed earlier, the Financial Stability Board defines fintech as "Technology-enabled innovation in financial services that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on the provision of financial services."6 Fintech risk involves the risk that fintech firms could disrupt business of financial services firms in the form of lost customers and lost revenue. Thus, fintech risk is broader and wider ranging than technology risk.

Fintech services such as cryptocurrencies (e.g., bitcoin) and blockchain provide a system that supports the exchange of value between two parties unknown to each other in a swift and effective way, without the need for financial intermediaries. Businesses or individuals can create agreements, make transactions, and build value without relying on banks, rating agencies, and government bodies to verify their identities, establish trust, or perform the critical business logic. By reducing transaction costs among all participants in the economy, fintech supports models of peer-to-peer mass collaboration that could make many existing organizational forms redundant. Clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas traditional FIs find too speculative or risky. However, investing in fintech may enable incumbents such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Credit Suisse to do more with less, streamline their businesses, and reduce risk in the process. Adoption of new technologies in financial services would require substantial expenditures in order to adapt to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. Further, the SEC noted that digital currencies limit the bank's ability to track movement of funds and comply with laws such as anti money laundering regulation.

The largest fintech companies include SoFi, an online personal finance company; Transferwise, an international money transfer provider; and Credit Karma, a platform that provides credit scores to users and also serves as a portal for people to search and apply for various financial services like loans, credit cards, and insurance. However, traditional financial institutions are investing in fintech as well. Since 2012, the top 10 U.S. banks participated in 81 deals to fintech startups, focusing on consumer services such as roboadvisors and companies offering easy-to-use money management apps. Based on a 2017 survey of 1,308 financial services and fintech executives, PwC reports that 88 percent of incumbents are increasingly concerned they are losing revenue to fintech firms. While fintechs are facing increased regulatory oversight, financial institutions are facing an increasing need to update their technological operating models for new competition, cut costs by simplifying outdated systems, build technology capabilities to better understand customer needs, and employ talent and skills necessary to execute and be successful in their fintech strategies. That said, traditional financial institutions have used risk management in a certain way for many years. They have large teams of highly skilled and experienced employees with years of experience in dealing with risk issues. Fintech firms, on the other hand, tend to have small teams using risk management processes that have been developed over a relatively short timeframe and that are untested in dealing with major risk events. Further, a risk event at a fintech firm can result in losses that are substantially more damaging. There is less history to create a protocol for a risk event and to provide confidence that the firm can manage through a problem. Chapter 19 summarizes the opportunities and risks of fintech in detail.

# INSOLVENCY RISK

LG 20-2

# insolvency risk

The risk that an FI may not have enough capital to offset a sudden decline in the value of its assets relative to its liabilities.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

19. When insolvency risk occurs?
20. How insolvency risk is related to credit risk and liquidity risk?

Insolvency risk is a consequence or an outcome of one or more of the risks described above: interest rate, market, credit, off-balance-sheet, technological, fintech, foreign exchange, sovereign, and liquidity. Technically, insolvency occurs when the capital or equity resources of an FI's owners are driven to, or near to, zero due to losses incurred as the result of one or more of the risks described previously. Consider the case of Washington Mutual (WaMu), which incurred heavy losses from its onand off-balance-sheet holdings during the financial crisis. By early September 2008, WaMu's market capital was worth only  \$3.5 billion, down from\$ 43 billion at the end of 2006. In September 2008, the bank was taken over by the FDIC and sold to OneWest Bank Group. In contrast, in March 2009 Citigroup's stock price fell to below \$1 per share and the once largest bank in the United States was near failure. Proving that some banks are too big to fail, Citigroup received a substantial government guarantee against losses (up to \$306 billion) and a \$20 billion injection of cash to prevent failure. Indeed, between October 2008 and December 2009 over 700 banks had received a total of \$205 billion in federal government funds (through the Capital Purchase Program) in an effort to prop up capital and support lending.[7]

In general, the more equity capital to borrowed funds an FI has—that is, the lower its leverage—the better able it is to withstand losses due to risk exposures such as adverse liquidity changes, unexpected credit losses, and so on. Thus, both the management and regulators of FIs focus on an FI's capital (and its "adequacy") as a key measure of its ability to remain solvent and grow in the face of a multitude of risk exposures. Chapter 13 discusses the issue of what is considered to be an adequate level of capital to manage an FI's overall risk exposure.

# OTHER RISKS AND INTERACTION AMONG RISKS

LG 20-3

This overview chapter concentrated on 11 major risks continuously impacting an FI manager's decision-making process and risk management strategy. These risks were credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market risk, off-balance-sheet risk, foreign exchange risk, country or sovereign risk, technology risk, operational risk, fintech risk, and insolvency risk. Even though the discussion generally described each independently, in reality these risks are interdependent. For example, when interest rates rise, corporations and consumers find maintaining promised payments on their debt more difficult. Thus, over some range of interest rate movements, credit and interest rate risks are positively correlated. Furthermore, the FI may have been counting on the funds from promised payments on its loans for liquidity management purposes. Thus, liquidity risk is also correlated with interest rate and credit risks. The inability of a customer to make promised payments also affects the FI's income and profits and, consequently, its equity or capital position. Thus, each risk and its interaction with other risks ultimately affects solvency risk. The interaction of the various risks also means that FI managers face making complicated trade-offs. In particular, as they take actions to manage one type of risk, FI managers must consider the possible impact of such actions on other risks.

Various other risks also impact an FI's profitability and risk exposure. Discrete risks include a sudden change in taxation, such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which subjected

21. What the term event risk means?
22. The event and general macroeconomic risks facing FIs?

banks to a minimum corporate tax rate of 20 percent (the alternative minimum tax) and limited their ability to expense the cost of funds used to purchase tax-free municipal bonds. Such changes can affect the attractiveness of some types of assets over others, as well as the liquidity of an FI's balance sheet. For example, banks' demand for municipal bonds fell quite dramatically following the 1986 tax law change. As a result, the municipal bond market became quite illiquid for a time.

Changes in regulatory policy constitute another type of discrete or event-type risk. These include lifting the regulatory barriers to lending or to entry or on products offered (see Chapter 13). The 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act is one example, as is the 2010 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Other discrete or event risks involve sudden and unexpected changes in financial market conditions due to war, revolution, or sudden market collapse, such as the 1929, 1987, 2008, and 2020 stock market crashes or the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. These can have a major impact on an FI's risk exposure. Other event risks include theft, malfeasance, and breach of fiduciary trust. All of these can ultimately cause an FI to fail or be severely harmed. Yet, each is difficult to model and predict.

More general macroeconomic risks such as increased inflation, inflation volatility, and unemployment can directly and indirectly impact an FI's level of interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk exposure. For example, the U.S. unemployment rate was over 10 percent in the summer of 2009, the highest level since September 1992. Since December 2007 (as the recession began), the U.S. economy lost over 6 million jobs, half of which were lost in the period November 2008 through June 2009. With so many people out of work, the credit risk exposure of FIs increased dramatically as borrowers had trouble keeping up with their loan payments after losing their jobs.

# SUMMARY

This chapter provided an overview of the major risks that modern FIs face. FIs face credit risk or default risk if their clients default on their loans and other obligations. They encounter liquidity risk as a result of excessive withdrawals of liabilities by customers. They face interest rate risk when the maturities of their assets and liabilities are mismatched. They incur market risk for their trading portfolios of assets and liabilities if adverse movements in the prices of these assets or liabilities occur. FIs also engage in significant amounts of off-balance-sheet activities, thereby exposing them to off-balance-sheet risks—changing values of their contingent assets and liabilities. If FIs conduct foreign business, they are subject to foreign exchange risk. Business dealings in foreign countries or with foreign companies also subject FIs to country or sovereign risk. The advent of sophisticated technology and automation increasingly exposes FIs to both technological and operational risks. On a wider scale FIs face fintech risk in which fintech firms could disrupt business of financial services firms in the form of lost customers and lost revenue. FIs face insolvency risk when their overall equity capital is insufficient to withstand the losses that they incur as a result of such risk exposures. The effective management of these risks—including the interaction among them—determines the ability of a modern FI to survive and prosper over the long run. The chapters that follow analyze these risks in greater detail, beginning with those risks incurred on the balance sheet.

1. A financial institution has the following market value balance sheet structure: (LG 20-1)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$ 1,000</td><td>Certificate of deposit</td><td>\$10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Bond</td><td>10,000</td><td>Equity</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>\$11,000</td><td>Total liabilities and equity</td><td>\$11,000</td></tr></table> a. The bond has a 10-year maturity, a fixed-rate coupon of 10 percent paid at the end of each year, and a par value of 10,000. The certificate of deposit has a 1-year maturity and a 6 percent fixed rate of interest. The FI expects no additional asset growth. What will be the net interest income (NII) at the end of the first year? (Note: Net interest income equals interest income minus interest expense.)
