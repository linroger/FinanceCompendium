# CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

In Chapter 20, we provided a basic description of the risks that emanate from financial markets as well as from the traditional activities of financial institutions. In the next three chapters, we provide a more detailed analysis of four of these risks. We also discuss how these risks can be managed. Specifically, we look at the measurement and management of credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and insolvency risk. We start our analysis with credit risk.

As discussed in Chapter 1, financial institutions (FIs) are special because of their ability to efficiently transform financial claims of household savers into claims issued to corporations, individuals, and governments. FIs' ability to process and evaluate information and control and monitor borrowers allows them to transform these claims at the lowest possible cost to all parties. One specific type of financial claim transformation discussed in Chapter 1 is credit allocation. FIs transform claims of household savers (in the form of deposits) into loans issued to corporations, individuals, and governments. The FI accepts the credit risk on these loans in exchange for a fair return sufficient to cover the cost of funding paid (e.g., covering the cost of borrowing or issuing deposits) to household savers, the credit risk involved in lending, and a profit margin reflecting competitive conditions.

Credit risk management is important for FI managers because it involves the determination of several features of a loan or debt instrument: interest rate, maturity, collateral, and other covenants. Riskier projects require more analysis before loans are approved or debt instruments are purchased. If credit risk analysis is inadequate, default rates could be higher and push an FI into insolvency, especially if the markets are competitive and the margins are low. Indeed, the default of one major borrower can have a significant impact on the value and reputation of many FIs. Similarly, a single major economic event can cause losses to many FIs' loan portfolios. For example, in 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in over  \$1.3 billion in bad loans for major banks operating in areas hit by the storm. And, of course, the financial crisis of 2008-2009 resulted in the largest ever credit risk-related losses for U.S. financial institutions. Losses from the falling value of onand off-balance-sheet credit instruments (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, credit cards) topped\$ 2.3 trillion worldwide. In just the first quarter of 2009, the annualized net charge-off rate on total loans and leases at U.S. banks was 1.94 percent, slightly below the 1.95 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 (which was the highest quarterly net charge-off rate in the 25 years that insured institutions have reported these data).

On an international scale, bank loan portfolios were exposed to losses from the European debt crisis. In early 2012, U.S. banks' exposure to Greek debt was relatively insignificant, at approximately  \$5.8 billion. However, the risks posed to U.S. banks and the banking system from a Greek debt default and a contagion crisis in other Euro-zone countries were huge. U.S. banks had more than\$ 50 billion worth of debt exposure to both Spain and Ireland, \$6.6 billion to Portugal, and over \$66 billion to Italy—all countries in risk of debt default in the event of a continued economic slowdown. Most recently, at the end of 2017, student loan debt swelled to nearly  \$1.38 trillion, with 11 percent of borrowers 90 days or more delinquent. As of 2018, approximately 4.6 million Americans had defaulted on federal student loans (defaults in the last quarter of 2017 alone totaled\$ 84 billion). By 2023, nearly 40 percent of borrowers are expected to default on their student loans. Personal consequences of student loan default can be wage garnishments, tax offsets, and other methods of loan collections. However, default—especially on the scale of 84 billion—can also have repercussions for the entire economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has researched how student debt has depressed home purchasing by young adults and found that as much as 35 percent of the decline in home ownership of people in their late 20s can be attributed to student loans. Defaults make it harder to take out credit or even own a credit card, stifling additional economic activity. Even with a strong national economy and a low unemployment rate, loan defaults can weigh down the entire country. These seemingly unending credit-related events stress FIs' need to manage their loan portfolios to protect the overall FI from failure due to credit risk.

In this chapter we look at the types of loans (real estate, individual [consumer], commercial and industrial [C&I], and others) as well as the characteristics of those loans made by U.S. FIs. We also examine various methods and models used to measure credit risk or default risk on individual loans (and bonds), including qualitative and quantitative models (e.g., credit-scoring models and newer models of credit risk measurement). Indeed, technological advances have been at least one driving force behind the advances and new models of credit risk measurement and management in recent years. In Appendix 21A (available through Connect or your course instructor), we consider methods for evaluating the risk of the overall loan portfolio, or loan concentration risk. Methods for hedging and managing an FI's credit risk, such as the use of credit derivative swaps, are left to Chapters 24 and 25. Finally in this chapter, we look at how both interest and fees are incorporated to calculate the return on a loan. Measurement of the credit risk on individual loans or bonds is crucial if an FI manager is to (1) price a loan or value a bond correctly and (2) set appropriate limits on the amount of credit extended to any one borrower or the loss exposure accepted from any particular counterparty.

# CREDIT QUALITY PROBLEMS

# junk bond

A bond rated as speculative or less than investment grade by bond rating agencies such as Moody's.

LG 21-1

Over the past three decades, the credit quality of many FIs' lending and investment decisions has attracted a great deal of attention. For most of the 1980s, tremendous problems occurred with bank and thrift residential and farm mortgage loans. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, attention shifted to the problems relating to commercial real estate loans (to which banks, thrifts, and insurance companies were all exposed) and junk bonds (bonds rated as speculative or less than investment-grade securities by rating agencies such as Moody's or S&P—see Chapter 6 for the assignment and meaning of bond ratings). In the late 1990s, concern shifted to the rapid increase in auto loans and credit cards as well as the declining quality in commercial lending standards as high-yield business loan delinquencies started to increase. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, attention has focused on problems with telecommunication companies, new technology companies, and a variety of sovereign countries, including at various times Argentina, Brazil, and Russia. Despite these credit concerns, the credit quality of most FIs improved throughout the 1990s. For example, for FDIC-insured commercial banks, the ratio of nonperforming loans to assets declined significantly from 1992 through 2000 (see Figure 21-1).

The recession in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s led to a reversal in this trend as nonperforming loan rates increased, particularly on C&I loans. However, the nonperformance of loans in all categories was still below that of the early 1990s. As the U.S. economy improved in the mid-2000s, nonperforming loan rates fell. But mortgage delinquencies, particularly on subprime mortgages, surged in the last quarter of 2006 and all of 2007 as homeowners who had stretched themselves financially to buy a home or refinance a mortgage in the early 2000s fell behind on their loan payments. Trouble in the mortgage markets continued to escalate as the number of foreclosures hit a record 1.5 million in the first six months of 2009 and over 8 percent of all real estate loans held by commercial banks were nonperforming (i.e., were past due 90 days or more). Problems in the mortgage markets spread to other sectors as well. In 2008 consumer bankruptcy filings rose to 1.06 million, up from 801,840 in 2007 and 602,000 in 2006. By late 2009, over 2.30 percent of all individual (consumer) loans held by commercial banks were nonperforming. Business loan losses grew as well, peaking at 3.57 percent in the third quarter of 2009. For example, when Chrysler went into bankruptcy in May 2009 it owed banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase,  \$6.9 billion. President Obama's plan for Chrysler's bankruptcy cut that to\$ 1 billion, for a loss to banks of \$5.9 billion. The banks ended up realizing 33 cents on the dollar for these loans—a loss of \$4.6 billion. As the U.S. economy slowly recovered in 2010–2019, nonperforming loan rates edged downward to some of the lowest levels seen throughout the 30-year period.

The potential loss an FI can experience from lending suggests that FIs need to collect information about borrowers whose assets are in their portfolios and monitor those borrowers over time. Thus, managerial efficiency and credit risk management strategies directly affect the return and risks of the loan portfolio. One of the advantages that FIs have over individual investors is the ability to diversify some credit risk by exploiting the law of large numbers in their asset investment portfolios (see Chapter 1). That is, diversification across assets exposed to credit risk reduces the overall credit risk in the asset portfolio and thus increases the probability of partial or full repayment of principal and/or interest.

A credit quality problem, in the worst case, can cause an FI to become insolvent, or it can result in such a significant drain on earnings and net worth that it can adversely affect the FI's profitability and its ability to compete with other domestic and international FIs. For example, on average, commercial banks hold over 50 percent of their assets in the form of loans (mortgage loans, C&I loans, consumer loans, and other loans), while they finance their total assets with an average of 11 percent equity (see Chapter 11). Large losses on these loans could quickly wipe out a bank's equity capital. Consider an FI with the following balance sheet:

<table><tr><td>Cash and other assets</td><td>\$ 48m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>\$ 89m</td></tr><tr><td>Gross loans</td><td>52m</td><td>Equity (net worth)</td><td>11m</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$100m</td><td></td><td>$100m</td></tr></table>

Suppose that the managers of the FI recognize that  \$11 million of its\$ 52 million in loans is unlikely to be repaid due to an increase in credit repayment difficulties of its borrowers. Eventually, the FI's managers must respond by charging off or writing down the value of these loans on the FI's balance sheet. This means that the value of loans falls from \$52 million to \$41 million, an economic loss that must be charged off against the stockholders' equity capital or net worth (i.e., equity capital falls from 11 million to zero). Thus, both sides of the balance sheet shrink by the amount of the loss:

<table><tr><td>Cash and other assets</td><td></td><td>$48m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$89m</td></tr><tr><td>Gross loans</td><td>52m</td><td></td><td>Equity after charge-off</td><td>0m</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Loan loss</td><td>-11m</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Loans after charge-off</td><td></td><td>41m</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>$89m</td><td></td><td>$89m</td></tr></table>

We discuss credit analysis next.

# CREDIT ANALYSIS

This section discusses credit analysis for real estate lending, consumer and small-business lending, mid-market commercial and industrial lending, and large commercial and industrial lending. It also provides insights into the credit risk evaluation process from the perspective of a credit officer (or an FI manager) evaluating a loan application.

LG 21-2

# Real Estate Lending

Because of the importance of residential mortgages to banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and insurance companies, residential mortgage loan applications are among the most standardized of all credit applications. In Chapter 7, we outlined the different types of characteristics of real estate loans (e.g., adjustable-rate versus fixed-rate mortgages, interest rate payments versus fee payments, $^{2}$  and down payments). In this chapter, we look at the evaluation process that FIs (such as commercial banks, savings institutions, and finance companies) use to determine whether a real estate loan application should be approved. Two considerations dominate an FI's decision to approve a mortgage loan application: (1) the applicant's ability and willingness to make timely interest and principal repayments and (2) the value of the borrower's collateral.

Ability and willingness of the borrower to repay debt outstanding is usually established by application of qualitative and quantitative models. The character of the applicant is also extremely important. Stability of residence, occupation, family status (e.g., married, single), previous history of savings, and credit (or bill payment) history are frequently used in assessing character. The loan officer must also establish whether the applicant has sufficient income. In particular, the loan amortization (i.e., principal and interest payments) should be reasonable when compared with the applicant's income and age. The loan officer should also consider the applicant's monthly expenditures. Family responsibilities and marital stability are also important. Monthly financial obligations relating to auto, personal, and credit card loans should be ascertained, and an applicant's personal balance sheet and income statement should be constructed.

# GDS (gross debt service) ratio

Total accommodation expenses (mortgage, lease, condominium, management fees, real estate taxes, etc.) divided by gross income.

# TDS (total debt service) ratio

Total accommodation expenses plus all other debt service payments divided by gross income.

Two ratios are very useful in determining a customer's ability to maintain mortgage payments: the GDS (gross debt service) ratio and the TDS (total debt service) ratio. The gross debt service ratio is the customer's total annual accommodation expenses (mortgage, lease, condominium management fees, real estate taxes, etc.) divided by annual gross income. The total debt service ratio is the customer's total annual accommodation expenses plus all other debt service payments divided by annual gross income. These can be represented as follows:

$$
\mathrm{GD S} = \frac{\text{An nu al mo rt ga ge pa ym en ts} + \text{Pr op er ty ta xe s}}{\text{An nu al gr os si nc om e}}
$$

$$
T D S = \frac{\text{An nu al to ta ld eb tp ay me nt s}}{\text{An nu al gr os si nc om e}}
$$

As a general rule, for an FI to consider an applicant, the GDS and TDS ratios must be less than an acceptable threshold. The threshold is commonly 25 to 30 percent for the GDS ratio and 35 to 40 percent for the TDS ratio.

# EXAMPLE 21-1 Calculation of the GDS and TDS Ratios

Consider two customers who have applied for a mortgage from an FI with a GDS threshold of 25 percent and a TDS threshold of 40 percent.

<table><tr><td>Customer</td><td>Gross Annual Income</td><td>Monthly Mortgage Payments</td><td>Annual Property Taxes</td><td>Monthly Other Debt Payments</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$150,000</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$3,500</td><td>$2,000</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>60,000</td><td>500</td><td>1,500</td><td>200</td></tr></table>

The GDS and TDS ratios for the mortgage applicants are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Customer</td><td>GDS</td><td>TDS</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3,000(12) + 3,500/150,000 = 26.33\%</td><td>3,000(12) + 3,500 + 2,000(12)/150,000 = 42.33\%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>500(12) + 1,500/60,000 = 12.50\%</td><td>500(12) + 1,500 + 200(12)/60,000 = 16.50\%</td></tr></table>

Despite a higher level of gross income, Customer 1 does not meet the GDS or TDS thresholds because of relatively high mortgage, tax, and other debt payments. Customer 2, while earning less, has fewer required payments and meets both the FI's GDS and TDS thresholds.

# LG 21-3

# credit-scoring system

A mathematical model that uses observed characteristics of the loan applicant to calculate a score that represents the applicant's probability of default.

FIs often combine the various factors affecting the ability and willingness to make loan repayments into a single credit score. A credit-scoring system (illustrated below) is a quantitative model that uses observed characteristics of the applicant to calculate a "score" representing the applicant's probability of default (versus repayment). Credit-scoring models are used to calculate the probability of default or to sort borrowers into different default risk classes. The primary benefit of credit-scoring models is to improve the accuracy of predicting borrowers' performance without using additional resources. This benefit results in fewer defaults and charge-offs to the FI. The models use data on observed economic and financial borrower characteristics to assist an FI manager in (1) identifying factors of importance in explaining default risk, (2) evaluating the relative degree of importance of these factors, (3) improving the pricing of default risk, (4) screening bad loan applicants, and (5) more efficiently calculating the necessary reserves to protect against future loan losses.

Credit-scoring systems are developed by using borrower characteristics (e.g., income, age, loan payment history) for some past period. The credit-scoring model weights each characteristic to identify a boundary number (score) or range such that if past loan customers had an overall credit score (derived from the weighted characteristics) greater than the boundary number (score) they did not default on the loan, whereas if they had a credit score less than the boundary number they defaulted on the loan. The boundary number or range is derived by statistical analysis, such as logit or discriminant analysis. Assuming new loan customers act like past customers, the credit-scoring system can then be used to calculate a credit score for new loan applicants and assign them to a high or low default risk group. The applicant's total score must be above the boundary score or range to be considered acceptable for a loan.

The theory behind credit scoring is that by selecting and combining different economic and financial characteristics, an FI manager may be able to separate good from bad loan customers based on the characteristics of borrowers who have defaulted in the past. One advantage of a credit-scoring system is that a loan applicant's credit quality is expressed as a single numerical value, rather than as a judgmental assessment of several separate factors. This is beneficial for FIs that must evaluate small loan applicants quickly, at low cost, and consistently and who would otherwise have to employ many more credit analysts (each of whom might well apply inconsistent standards across different loan applicants as well as adding to the FI's labor costs).

If the FI uses a scoring system, the loan officer can give an immediate answer—yes, maybe, or no—and the reasons for that answer. A maybe occurs in borderline cases or when the loan officer is uncertain of the classification of certain input information. A credit-scoring system allows an FI to reduce the ambiguity and turnaround time and increase the transparency of the credit approval process.

# EXAMPLE 21-2 Credit Scoring of a Real Estate Loan

An FI uses the following credit-scoring model to evaluate real estate loan applications:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Characteristic</td><td colspan="4">Characteristic Values and Weights</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Annual gross income</td><td>&lt;$10,000</td><td>$10,000–$25,000</td><td>$25,000–$50,000</td><td>$50,000–$100,000 &gt;$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>15</td><td>35</td><td>50</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>TDS</td><td>&gt;50\%</td><td>35\%-50\%</td><td>15\%-35\%</td><td>5\%-15\%</td><td>&lt;5\%</td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>35</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Relations with FI</td><td>None</td><td>Checking account</td><td>Savings account</td><td>Both</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>60</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Major credit cards</td><td>None</td><td>1 or more</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>&lt;25</td><td>25-60</td><td>&gt;60</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>5</td><td>30</td><td>35</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Residence</td><td>Rent</td><td>Own with mortgage</td><td>Own outright</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>50</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Length of residence</td><td>&lt;1 year</td><td>1-5 years</td><td>&gt;5 years</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>45</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Job stability</td><td>&lt;1 year</td><td>1-5 years</td><td>&gt;5 years</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Credit history</td><td>No record</td><td>Missed a payment in last 5 years</td><td>Met all payments</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Score</td><td>0</td><td>-15</td><td>50</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The loan is automatically rejected if the applicant's total score is less than 120 (i.e., applicants with a score of 120 or less have, in the past, mainly defaulted on their loan). The loan is automatically approved if the total score is greater than 190 (i.e., applicants with a score of 190 or more have, in the past, mainly paid their loan in complete accordance with the loan agreement). A score between 120 and 190 is reviewed by a loan committee for a final decision.

A loan customer listing the following information on the loan application receives the following points:

<table><tr><td>Characteristic</td><td>Value</td><td>Score</td></tr><tr><td>Annual gross income</td><td>67,000</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>TDS</td><td>12\%</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Relations with FI</td><td>None</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Major credit cards</td><td>4</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>37</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Residence</td><td>Own/mortgage</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Length of residence</td><td>2½ years</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Job stability</td><td>2½ years</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Credit history</td><td>Met all payments</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total score</td><td></td><td>250</td></tr></table>

The real estate loan for this customer would be automatically approved.

# perfecting collateral

The process of ensuring that collateral used to secure a loan is free and clear to the lender should the borrower default on the loan.

# foreclosure

The process of taking possession of the mortgaged property in satisfaction of a defaulting borrower's indebtedness and forgoing claim to any deficiency.

# power of sale

The process of taking the proceedings of the forced sale of a mortgaged property in satisfaction of the indebtedness and returning to the mortgagor the excess over the indebtedness or claiming any shortfall as an unsecured creditor.

Rather than develop and use a proprietary credit-scoring model, many (particularly smaller) FIs use FICO scores to evaluate mortgage (and consumer) loans. Developed by Bill Fair and Earl Isaac (Fair Isaac Corp.), the FICO score uses five factors to determine a loan applicant's score. In order of importance, they are:

1. Payment history (35\% of the FICO score).
2. Debt/amounts owed (30\% of the FICO score).
3. Age of credit history (15\% of the FICO score).
4. New credit/inquiries (10\% of the FICO score).
5. Mix of accounts/types of credit (10\% of the FICO score).

The FICO scale runs from 300 to 850. A score of 800 or above indicates an exceptional FICO score (approximately  $1\%$  of consumers with a credit score of  $800+$  are likely to become seriously delinquent in the future). A score of 579 or below indicates a poor FICO score and is considered to be poor credit (approximately  $61\%$  of consumers with a credit score under 579 are likely to become seriously delinquent in the future). The vast majority of people have scores between 600 and 800. A score of 720 or higher is generally sufficient to receive favorable interest rates on a mortgage.

Verification of the borrower's financial statements is essential. For example, if the answer is yes to a loan application, the loan officer states that the FI is prepared to grant the loan subject to a verification of his or her creditworthiness and obtains the applicant's permission to make all necessary inquiries. The collateral backing the mortgage is normally considered only after the loan officer has established that the applicant can service the loan. If collateral secures a loan, the FI must make sure that its claim, should the borrower default, is free and clear from other claims. This process is referred to as perfecting a security interest in the collateral. Even if collateral secures the loan, no FI should become involved in a loan that is likely to go into default. In such a case, the FI would at best seize the property in a foreclosure (where the FI takes possession of the mortgaged property in satisfaction of the defaulting borrower's indebtedness, forgoing claim to any deficiency) or power of sale (where the FI takes the proceedings of the forced sale of a mortgaged property in satisfaction of the indebtedness and returns to the mortgagor the excess over the indebtedness or claims any shortfall as an unsecured creditor).

Finally, before an FI accepts a mortgage, it must satisfy itself regarding the property involved in the loan by doing the following:

- Confirming the title and legal description of the property.
- Obtaining a surveyor's certificate confirming that the house is within the property boundaries.
- Checking with the tax office to confirm that no property taxes are unpaid.
- Requesting a land title search to determine that there are no other claims against the property.
- Obtaining an independent appraisal to confirm that the purchase price is in line with the market value.

# Consumer (Individual) and Small-Business Lending

The techniques used for mortgage loan credit analysis are very similar to those applied to individual and small-business loans. Individual consumer loans are scored like mortgages, often without the borrower ever meeting the loan officer. Unlike mortgage loans for which the focus is on a property, however, nonmortgage consumer loans focus on the individual's ability to repay. Thus, credit-scoring models for such loans would put more weight on personal characteristics such as annual gross income, the TDS score, and so on.

Small-business loans are more complicated because the FI is frequently asked to assume the credit risk of an individual whose business cash flows require considerable analysis, often with incomplete accounting information available to the credit officer. Typically, loans are made to small businesses to help start up the company. This creates several problems. There is less history to base the loan on. Numerical scoring rules may be less useful in this case. A start-up business that fails may also have less collateral value compared to a larger company. Because of this, the personal assets of the small-business owner may be used as collateral on the loan. A loan to a small business will necessarily be small, so the size of the profits to be earned by the FI from the loan is not likely to be very substantial. A  \$50,000 loan with a 3 percent interest spread over the cost of funds provides only\$ 1,500 of gross revenues before loan loss provisions, monitoring costs, and allocation of overheads. This low profitability has caused many FIs to build small-business scoring models similar to, but more sophisticated than, those used for mortgages and consumer credit. These models often combine computer-based financial analysis of borrower financial statements with behavioral analysis of the owner of the small business.

# Mid-Market Commercial and Industrial Lending

In recent years, mid-market commercial and industrial lending has offered some of the most profitable opportunities for credit-granting FIs. Although definitions of mid-market corporates vary, they typically have sales revenues from  \$5 million to\$ 100 million a year, have a recognizable corporate structure (unlike many small businesses), but do not have ready access to deep and liquid capital markets (as do large corporations). Commercial loans can be made for periods as short as a few weeks to as long as eight years or more. Traditionally, short-term commercial loans (those with an original maturity of one year or less) are used to finance firms' working capital needs and other short-term funding needs, while long-term commercial loans are used to finance credit needs that extend beyond one year, such as the purchase of real assets (machinery), new venture start-up costs, and permanent increases in working capital. They can be made in quite small amounts, such as \$100,000 to small businesses, or in packages as large as \$1 billion or more to major corporations.

Credit analysis of a mid-market corporate customer differs from that of a small business because, while still assessing the character of the firm's management, its main focus is on the business itself. The credit process begins with an account officer gathering information by meeting existing customers, checking referrals, and meeting with new business prospects. Having gathered information about the credit applicant, an account officer decides whether it is worthwhile to pursue the new business, given the applicant's needs, the FI's credit policies, the current economy, and the competitive lending environment. If it is, the account officer structures and prices the credit agreement with reference to the FI's credit granting policy. This includes several areas of analysis, including the five C's of credit, cash flow analysis, ratio analysis, and financial statement comparisons (described below). At any time in this process, conditions could change or new information could be revealed, significantly changing the borrower's situation and forcing the account officer to begin the process again.

Once the applicant and an account officer tentatively agree on a loan, the account officer must obtain internal approval from the FI's credit risk management team. Generally, even for the smallest mid-market credit, at least two officers must approve a new loan customer. Larger credit requests must be presented formally (either in hard copy or through a computer network) to a credit approval officer and/or committee before they can be signed. This means that, during the negotiations, the account officer must be very well acquainted with the FI's overall credit philosophy and current strategy.

Five C's of Credit. To analyze the loan applicant's credit risk, the account officer must understand the customer's character, capacity, collateral, conditions, and capital (sometimes referred to as the five C's of credit). Character refers to the probability that the loan applicant will try to honor the loan obligations. Capacity is a subjective judgment regarding the applicant's ability to pay the FI according to the terms of the loan. Collateral is represented by assets that the loan applicant offers as security backing the loan. Conditions refer to any general economic trends or special developments in certain geographic regions or sectors of the economy that might affect the applicant's ability to meet the loan obligations. Capital is measured by the general financial condition of the applicant as indicated by an

LG 21-4 analysis of the applicant's financial statements and leverage. Some important questions that provide information on the five C's follow.

# Production (measures of capacity and conditions)
- On what production inputs does the applicant depend?
- To what extent does this cause supply risk?
How do input price risks affect the applicant?
How do costs of production compare with those of the competition?
How does the quality of goods and services produced compare with those of the competition?

# Management (measures of character and conditions)

Is management trustworthy?

- Is management skilled at production? Marketing? Finance? Building an effective organization?
To what extent does the company depend on one or a few key players?
Is there a succession plan for senior management?
- Are credible and sensible accounting, budgeting, and control systems in place?

# Marketing (measures of conditions)

How are the changing needs of the applicant's customers likely to affect the applicant?

How creditworthy are the applicant's customers?

At what stage of their life cycles are the applicant's products and services?

What are the market share and share growth of the applicant's products and services?

What is the applicant's marketing policy?

- Who are the applicant's competitors? What policies are they pursuing? Why are they able to remain in business?
How is the applicant meeting changing market needs?

# Capital (measures of capital and collateral)

How much equity is currently funding the firm's assets?

How much access does the firm have to equity and debt markets?

Will the company back the loan with the firm's assets?

Cash Flow Analysis. As an initial step of the loan analysis, FIs require business loan applicants to provide cash flow information, which provides the FI with relevant information about the applicant's cash receipts and disbursements compared to the principal and interest payments on the loan. In general, some activities increase cash (cash receipts) and some decrease cash (cash disbursements). Table 21-1 classifies the firm's basic cash receipts (sources of cash) and disbursements (uses of cash). Cash receipts include increasing liabilities (or equity) or decreasing noncash assets. For example, if a firm sells new common stock, the firm has used primary markets to raise cash. Likewise, a drop in accounts receivable means that the firm has collected cash from its credit sales—also a cash receipt.

TABLE 21-1 Sources and Uses of Cash

<table><tr><td>Sources of Cash</td><td>Uses of Cash</td></tr><tr><td>Decrease a noncash current asset</td><td>Increase a noncash current asset</td></tr><tr><td>Decrease a fixed asset</td><td>Increase a fixed asset</td></tr><tr><td>Increase a current liability</td><td>Decrease a current liability</td></tr><tr><td>Increase long-term debt</td><td>Decrease long-term debt</td></tr><tr><td>Net income</td><td>Net losses</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation</td><td>Pay dividends</td></tr><tr><td>Sell common or preferred stock</td><td>Repurchase common or preferred stock</td></tr></table>

The firm uses cash to decrease a liability (paying off a bank loan) or to increase noncash assets (buying inventory). The statement of cash flows separates these cash flows into four categories or sections: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, cash flows from financing activities, and net change in cash and marketable securities. The basic setup of a statement of cash flows is presented in Table 21-2.

Cash flows from operations are those cash inflows and outflows that result directly from producing and selling the firm's products. These cash flows include: net income and changes in working capital accounts other than cash and operations-related short-term debt. Most loan officers consider this top section of the statement of cash flows to be the most important. It shows quickly and compactly the firm's cash flows generated by and used for the production process. That is, it shows whether the production and sale of the firm's product results in a net cash inflow for the firm. Loan officers look for positive cash flows from operations as a sign of a successful firm—positive cash flows from the firm's operations are precisely what gives the firm value. Unless the firm has a stable, healthy pattern in its cash flows from operations, it is not financially healthy no matter what its level of cash flows from investing activities or cash flows from financing activities.

Cash flows from investing activities are cash flows associated with buying or selling fixed or other long-term assets. This section of the statement of cash flows shows cash inflows and outflows from long-term investing activities—most significantly the firm's investment in fixed assets.

# TABLE 21-2 The Statement of Cash Flows

D. Net change in cash and marketable securities

Cash flows from financing activities are cash flows that result from debt and equity financing transactions. These include raising cash by issuing short-term debt, long-term debt, and stock and using cash to pay dividends, pay off debt, and buy back stock. Loan officers normally look for the "cash flows from financing activities" figure to show small amounts of net borrowing along with dividend payments. If, however, a firm is going through a major period of expansion, net borrowing could reasonably be much higher.

The bottom line of the statement of cash flows shows the sum of cash flows from operations, investing activities, and financing activities. The bottom line will reconcile to the net change in cash and marketable securities account on the balance sheet over the period of analysis.

Even though a company may report a large amount of net income on its income statement during a year, the firm may actually receive a positive, negative, or zero amount of cash. Accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) create this sense of discord: net income is the result of accounting rules, or GAAP, that do not necessarily reflect the firm's cash flows. While the income statement shows a firm's accounting-based income, the statement of cash flows more often reflects reality today and is thus more important to managers and investors as they seek to answer such important questions as: Does the firm generate sufficient cash to pay its operating expenses? Does the firm generate sufficient cash to purchase assets needed for sustained growth? Does the firm generate sufficient cash to pay down its outstanding debt obligations, thus avoiding financial distress?

When evaluating the cash flow statement, FIs want to see that the loan applicant can pay back the loan with cash flows produced from the applicant's operations. FIs do not (except as a last resort) want the loan applicant to pay back the loan by selling fixed assets or issuing additional debt. Thus, the cash flows from the operating activities section of the cash flow statement are most critical to the FI in evaluating the loan applicant.

# EXAMPLE 21-3 Computation of Cash Flow Statement

Consider the financial statement for the loan applicant presented in Table 21-3. The cash flow statement reconciles the change in the firm's cash assets account from 2021 to 2022 as equal to -\61\$ (see the first row of Panel A). Construction of the cash flow statement begins with all cash flow items associated with the operating activities of the applicant. Panel A of Table 21-4 shows that the cash flows from operations total -\78. Next, cash flows from investment activities (i.e., fixed-asset investments and other nonoperating investments of the firm) are calculated in Table 21-4, Panel B, as -\168. Finally, cash flows from financing activities are shown in Panel C as \185. The sum of these cash flow activities, reported in Panel D, -\61, equals the change in the cash account from 2021 to 2022 (Table 21-3, Panel A, first row). Given that the loan should be repaid from cash flows from operations, which are negative (i.e., -\78, this loan applicant will likely be rejected.

Ratio Analysis. In addition to cash flow information, an applicant requesting specific levels of credit substantiates these business needs by presenting historical audited financial statements and projections of future needs. Historical financial statement analysis can be useful in determining whether cash flow and profit projections are plausible on the basis of the history of the applicant and in highlighting the applicant's risks.

Calculation of financial ratios is useful when performing financial statement analysis on a mid-market corporate applicant. Although stand-alone accounting ratios are used for determining the size of the credit facility, the analyst may find relative ratios more informative when determining how the applicant's business is changing over time (i.e., time series analysis) or how the applicant's ratios compare to those of its competitors (i.e., cross-sectional analysis). Ratio analysis almost always includes a comparison of one firm's ratios relative to the ratios of other firms in the industry, or cross-sectional analysis. Key to cross-sectional analysis is identifying similar firms that compete in the same markets, have similar size assets, and operate in a similar manner to the firm being analyzed.

Since no two firms are identical, obtaining such a comparison group is no easy task. Thus, the choice of companies to use in cross-sectional analysis is at best subjective. Comparative ratios that can be used in cross-sectional analysis are available from many sources. Value Line Investment Surveys, Robert Morris Associates, and Hoover's Online are examples of three major sources of financial ratios for numerous industries that operate within the United States and worldwide.

Hundreds of ratios could be calculated from any set of accounting statements. The following are a few that most credit analysts find useful. Values of the ratios using the 2022 financial statements in Table 21-3 are also presented.

# Liquidity Ratios

$$
\text{Cu rr en tr at io} = \frac{\text{Cu rr en ta ss et s}}{\text{Cu rr en tl ia bi li ti es}} = \frac{3 , 6 9 7}{2 , 6 7 6} = 1. 3 8 \text{ti me s}
$$

$$
\text{Qu ic kr at io (ac id -t es tr at io)} = \frac{\text{Cu rr en ta ss et s} - \text{In ve nt or y}}{\text{Cu rr en tl ia bi li ti es}} = \frac{3 , 6 7 9 - 1 , 7 7 9}{2 , 6 7 6} = 0. 7 2 \text{ti me s}
$$

Liquidity provides the defensive cash and near-cash resources for firms to meet claims for payment. Liquidity ratios express the variability of liquid resources relative to potential claims. When considering the liquidity of a loan applicant, high levels of liquidity effectively guard against liquidity crises but at the cost of lower returns on investment. Note that a company with a very predictable cash flow can maintain low levels of liquidity without much liquidity risk. Account officers frequently request detailed cash flow projections from an applicant that specify exactly when cash inflows and outflows are anticipated.

# Asset Management Ratios

$$

The asset management ratios give the account officer clues as to how well the applicant uses its assets relative to its past performance and the performance of the industry. For example, ratio analysis may reveal that the number of days that finished goods are in inventory is increasing. This suggests that finished goods inventories, relative to the sales they support, are not being used as well as in the past. If this increase is the result of a deliberate policy to increase inventories to offer customers a wider choice and if it results in higher future sales volumes or increased margins that more than compensate for increased capital tied up in inventory, the increased relative size of finished goods inventories is good for the applicant and, thus, the FI. An FI should be concerned, on the other hand, if increased finished goods inventories are the result of declining sales but steady purchases of supplies and production. Inventory aging schedules give more information than single ratios and should be requested by the account officer concerned about deteriorating ratios.

What a loan applicant often describes in words differs substantially from what the ratio analysis reveals. For example, a company that claims to be a high-volume producer but has low sales-to-assets ratios relative to the industry bears further investigation. In discussing the analysis with the applicant, the account officer not only gains a better appreciation of the applicant's strategy and needs but also may help the applicant better understand the company relative to financial and industry norms.

# Debt and Solvency Ratios

$$
\text{Debt-to -assetratio} = \frac{\text{Short -termliabilities +Long -termliabilities}}{\text{Totalassets}} = \frac{2,676 + 300}{4,430} = 67.18 \%

$$

# EBIT

Earnings before interest and taxes.

where EBIT represents earnings before interest and taxes (i.e., operating profit).

Debt and solvency ratios give the account manager an idea of the extent to which the applicant finances its assets with debt versus equity. Specifically, the lower the debt-to-asset ratio, the less debt and more equity the applicant uses to finance its assets (i.e., the bigger the applicant's equity cushion). Similarly, the higher the times interest earned ratio and the cash-flow-to-debt ratio, the more equity and less debt the applicant uses to finance its assets.

Adequate levels of equity capital are as critical to the health of a credit applicant as they are to the health of FIs. The account officer analyzing a credit application or renewal wishes to know whether a sufficient equity cushion exists to absorb fluctuations in the loan applicant's earnings and asset values and whether sufficient cash flow exists to make debt service payments. Clearly, the larger the fluctuations or variability of cash flows, the larger is the need for an equity cushion. Note that from a secured debtor's point of view (e.g., a bank lender), the unsecured creditors and subordinate lenders (such as subordinate bond holders) form part of the quasi-equity cushion in liquidation. The secured creditor must make sure, however, that it enjoys true seniority in cash payments so that the firm's assets are not liquidated in paying down the claims of the subordinate (junior) creditors and equity holders.

With the help of the times interest earned, fixed-charge coverage, and cash coverage ratios, managers, investors, and analysts can determine whether a firm has taken on a debt burden that is too large. The times interest earned ratio measures the number of dollars of operating earnings available to meet each dollar of interest obligations on the firm's debt. A value of 1 for this ratio means that  \$1 of earnings is available to meet each dollar of interest payment obligations. A value of less (greater) than 1 means that the applicants have less (more) than\$ 1 of earnings available to pay each dollar of interest payment obligations. The fixed-charge coverage ratio measures the number of dollars of operating earnings available to meet the firm's interest obligations and other fixed charges. This ratio can be tailored to the applicant's situation, depending on what really constitutes fixed charges that must be paid. One version of it follows: (EBIT + Lease payments)/[Interest + Lease payments + Sinking fund/(1 - T)], where  $T$  is the marginal tax rate. Here, it is assumed that sinking fund payments must be made. They are adjusted by the division of  $(1 - T)$  into a before-tax cash outflow so they can be added to other before-tax cash outflows. The cash coverage ratio measures the number of dollars of operating cash available to meet each dollar of debt interest charges that the firm owes.

These three ratios measure the dollars available to meet debt and other fixed-charge obligations. A value of one for these ratios means that  \$1 of earnings or cash is available to meet each dollar of interest or fixed-charge obligations. A value of less (greater) than 1 means that the firm has less (more) than\$ 1 of earnings or cash available to pay each dollar of interest or fixed-charge obligations. Further, the higher the times interest earned, fixed-charge coverage, and cash coverage ratios, the more equity and less debt the firm uses to finance its assets. Thus, low levels of debt will lead to a dilution of the return to stockholders due to increased use of equity as well as to not taking advantage of the tax deductibility of interest expense.

Profitability Ratios.

$$
\text{Grossmargin} = \frac{\text{Grossprofit}}{\text{Sales}} = \frac{4,175}{12,430} = 33.59 \%
$$

$$
\text{Operatingprofitmargin} = \frac{\text{Operatingprofit}}{\text{Sales}} = \frac{684}{12,430} = 5.50\%
$$

$$
\text{Returnonassets} = \frac{\text{EAT}}{\text{Totalassets}} = \frac{339}{4,430} = 7.65 \%
$$

$$
\text{Returnonequity} = \frac{\text{EAT}}{\text{Totalequity}} = \frac{339}{1,454} = 23.31 \%
$$

$$
\text{Dividendpayout} = \frac{\text{Dividends}}{\text{EAT}} = \frac{50}{339} = 14.75\%
$$

# EAT

Earnings after taxes.

where EAT represents earnings after taxes, or net income.

For all but the dividend payout ratio, the higher the value of the ratio, the higher the profitability of the firm. The dividend payout ratio measures how much of the profit is retained in the firm versus paid out to the stockholders as dividends. The lower the dividend payout ratio, the more profits (percentage wise) are retained in the firm. A profitable firm that retains its earnings increases its level of equity capital as well as its creditworthiness. The analyst should be concerned about large swings in profitability as well as profit trends.[7]

Cautions with Ratio Analysis. While ratio analysis provides useful information about a loan applicant's financial condition, it also has limitations that require care and judgment in its use. For example, many firms operate in more than one industry. For these companies, it is difficult to construct a meaningful set of industry averages. Further, different accounting practices can distort industry comparisons. For example, the loan applicant may be using straight line depreciation for its fixed assets, while industry competitors are using an accelerated cost recovery method (ACRS), which causes depreciation to accrue quickly. ACRS methods will cause fixed asset values to be written down quickly and leave their book value lower than straight line depreciation. This can distort the analysis of fixed asset-based ratios. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to generalize whether a particular value for a ratio is good or bad. For example, a high current ratio can be a sign of a highly liquid firm or one that holds excessive cash. FI loan officers need to be aware of the problems with ratio analysis in analyzing the loan applicant's financial statements and making a loan decision.

Common-Size Analysis and Growth Rates. In addition to the ratios listed previously, an analyst can compute sets of ratios by dividing all income statement amounts by total sales revenue and all balance sheet amounts by total assets. These calculations yield common-size financial statements that can be used to identify changes in corporate performance. Year-to-year growth rates also give useful ratios for identifying trends. Common-size financial statements may provide quantitative clues as to the direction in which the firm is moving as well as the direction that the analysis should take.

Having reviewed the financial and other conditions of the applicant, the FI can include loan covenants (similar to bond covenants discussed in Chapter 6) as a part of the loan agreement. Loan covenants reduce the risk of the loan to the lender. They can include a variety of conditions such as maintenance of various ratios at or within stated ranges, key-person insurance policies on employees critical to the success of the project funded by the loan, and so on.

Following Approval. The credit process does not end when the applicant signs the loan agreement. As is the case for mortgage loans, before allowing a drawdown (the actual release of the funds to the borrower) of a mid-market credit, the account officer must make sure that

# conditions precedent

Those conditions specified in the credit agreement that must be fulfilled before drawdowns are permitted.

conditions precedent have been cleared. Conditions precedent are those conditions specified in the credit agreement that must be fulfilled before drawdowns are permitted. These include various title searches, perfecting of collateral, and the like. Following drawdown, the credit must be monitored throughout the loan's life to ensure that the borrower is living up to its commitments and to detect any deterioration in the borrower's creditworthiness so as to protect the FI's interest in the loan being repaid in full with the promised interest return.

Typically, the borrower's credit needs will change from time to time. A growing company has an expanding need for credit. A company moving into the international arena needs foreign exchange. A contractor may have periodic guarantee requests. Even if the credit agreements being offered do not change, a corporation's credit needs are usually reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that they comply with the terms of the original credit agreement. FIs typically wish to maintain close contact with customers to meet their ongoing financial service requirements—both credit and noncredit—so that the relationship will develop into a permanent, mutually beneficial one (the customer relationship effect).

LG 21-5

# Large Commercial and Industrial Lending

An FI's bargaining strength is severely diminished when it deals with large creditworthy corporate customers. Large corporations are able to issue debt and equity directly in the capital markets as well as to make private placements of securities. Also, they typically maintain credit relationships with several FIs and have significant in-house financial expertise. They manage their cash positions through the money markets by issuing their own commercial paper (see Chapter 5) to meet fund shortfalls and use excess funds to buy Treasury bills, banker's acceptances, and other companies' commercial paper. Moreover, large corporate clients are not seriously restricted by international borders but have operations and access to international capital markets and FIs in many parts of the world. Large corporate clients are very attractive to FIs because, although spreads and fees are small in percentage terms, the transactions are often large enough to make them very profitable as long as a default does not occur and they offer the potential for cross-selling other FI products to the client.

Specifically, the FI's relationship with large corporate clients goes beyond lending. The FI's role as broker, dealer, and advisor to a corporate client may rival or exceed the importance of its role as a lender. A large corporate client is likely to investigate several avenues for obtaining credit and to compare, for example, the flexibility and cost of a bond, a private placement, and borrowing from different FIs. The client may periodically poll FIs to determine opportune times to tap financial markets, even if this means inventorying funds. The FI's loan account officer must often liaise with the FI's investment banker to obtain information and indicative pricing on new security issues. Clearly, the amount of time this involves means that an FI's senior corporate account officer manages far fewer accounts than colleagues providing mid-market credits.

In providing a credit service to large corporations, credit management remains an important issue. Large corporations frequently use loan commitments (a contractual commitment to loan to a firm a certain maximum amount at a given interest rate), performance guarantees (such as letters of credit—see Chapter 5), and term loans, as do mid-market corporates. If the FI is contracting in spot and forward foreign exchange or swaps, or is engaging in other derivative activities with the corporate client as a counterparty, it must do so within the credit limits established by a regular credit review process.

An additional complicating factor is that large corporate accounts often consist of several related corporate entities under a common management. For example, a holding company may wholly own, control, or have substantial stakes in various operating subsidiaries. A subsidiary's credit risk may be better than, the same as, or worse than that of a holding company as a whole. An FI lending to a holding company with no assets other than its equity stake in its subsidiaries puts itself in a subordinate lending position relative to the lenders to the operating subsidiaries, which have direct claims over those subsidiaries' operating assets.

An account officer preparing a credit review for a large corporate customer often faces a complex task. The standard methods of analysis that we introduced when discussing mid-market corporates apply to large corporate clients but with additional complications. The corporate business often crosses more than one business activity and location. Hence, industry comparisons are difficult at best. Additional analytical aids are available to account officers. Specifically, large corporations are tracked by rating agencies and market analysts, who can provide account officers with a great deal of information to aid in their credit analysis. Also, because of these customers' additional complexities and large credit risk exposures, FIs can use sophisticated credit-scoring models in the credit review process based on accounting and/or financial market data. We discuss two such credit-scoring models below.

Credit-Scoring Models. Credit-scoring models use data on observed borrower characteristics either to calculate the probability of default or to sort borrowers into different default risk classes. By selecting and combining different economic and financial borrower characteristics, an FI manager may be able to:

1. Numerically establish which factors are important in explaining default risk.
2. Evaluate the relative degree or importance of these factors.
3. Improve the pricing of default risk.
4. Screen high-risk loan applicants.
5. Calculate any reserves needed to meet expected future loan losses.

To employ credit-scoring models in this manner, the FI manager must identify objective economic and financial measures of risk for any particular class of borrower. For consumer loans, the objective characteristics in a credit-scoring model might include income, assets, age, occupation, and location. For commercial loans, cash flow information and financial ratios such as the debt-to-equity ratio are usually key factors. After data are identified, a statistical technique quantifies or scores the default risk probability or default risk classification.

Altman's Z Score. E. I. Altman developed a  $Z$ -score model for analyzing publicly traded manufacturing firms in the United States. The indicator variable  $Z$  is an overall measure of the borrower's default risk classification. This classification, in turn, depends on the values of various financial ratios of the borrower  $(X_{j})$  and the weighted importance of these ratios based on the observed experience of defaulting versus nondefaulting borrowers derived from a discriminant analysis model. $^{8}$

Altman's credit-scoring model takes the following form:

$$
Z = 1. 2 X_{1} + 1. 4 X_{2} + 3. 3 X_{3} + 0. 6 X_{4} + 1. 0 X_{5}
$$ where


$X_{1} =$  Working capital/Total assets

$X_{2} =$  Retained earnings/Total assets

$X_{3} =$  Earnings before interest and taxes/Total assets

$X_{4} =$  Market value of equity/Book value of total liabilities

$X_{5} =$  Sales/Total assets

According to Altman's credit-scoring model, any firm with a  $Z$  score of less than 1.81 should be considered a high default risk firm; between 1.81 and 2.99, an indeterminate default risk firm; and greater than 2.99, a low default risk firm.

# EXAMPLE 21-4 Calculation of Altman's Z Score

Suppose that the financial ratios of a potential borrowing firm take the following values:

$$

\begin{array}{l} X_{1} = 0. 2 \\ X_{2} = 0 \\ X_{3} = - 0. 2 0 \\ X_{4} = 0. 1 0 \\ X_{5} = 2. 0 \\ \end{array}

$$

See also footnote 4 in this chapter for a discussion of this technique. Other models include linear probability models and logit models. See A. Saunders and M. M. Cornett, Financial Institutions Management: A Risk Management Approach, 9th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2018). 9. Working capital is Current assets—Current liabilities.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

The ratio  $X_{2}$  is zero and  $X_{3}$  is negative, indicating that the firm has had negative earnings or losses in recent periods. Also,  $X_{4}$  indicates that the borrower is highly leveraged. However, the working capital ratio  $(X_{1})$  and the sales/assets ratio  $(X_{5})$  indicate that the firm is reasonably liquid and is maintaining its sales volume. The  $Z$  score provides an overall score or indicator of the borrower's credit risk since it combines and weights these five factors according to their past importance in explaining (discriminating between) borrower default and borrower repayment. For the borrower in question:

$$

\begin{array}{l} Z = 1. 2 (0. 2) + 1. 4 (0) + 3. 3 (- 0. 2 0) + 0. 6 (0. 1 0) + 1. 0 (2. 0) \\ Z = 0. 2 4 + 0 - 0. 6 6 + 0. 0 6 + 2. 0 \\ Z = 1. 6 4 \\ \end{array}

$$

With a  $Z$  score less than 1.81 (i.e., in the high default risk region), the FI should not make a loan to this borrower until it improves its earnings.

2. The steps a mortgage loan officer must take between the time a credit score is determined and a loan is actually given out to a borrower?
3. The differences between mortgage lending and consumer and small-business lending?
4. Why an account officer must be well versed in the FI's credit policy before talking to potential borrowers?
5. Why a credit officer should be concerned if a borrower's number of days in inventory increases beyond the industry norm?
6. Why large corporations do not rely heavily on FIs to fulfill their financing needs?
7. What the major problems with the Z-score model of credit risk are?

Use of the  $Z$ -score model to make credit risk evaluations has a number of problems. The first problem is that this model usually discriminates only among three cases of borrower behavior: high, indeterminate, and low default risk. As discussed in Chapter 20, in the real world various gradations of default exist, from nonpayment or delay of interest payments (nonperforming assets) to outright default on all promised interest and principal payments. This problem suggests that a more accurate or finely calibrated sorting among borrowers may require defining more classes in the scoring model.

The second problem is that there is no obvious economic reason to expect that the weights in the  $Z$ -score model—or, more generally, the weights in any credit-scoring model—will be constant over any but very short periods. Further, discriminant analysis models are very sensitive to the weights for the different variables. Since different industries have different operating characteristics, there is no reason that the functions would be similar for different industries. In the retail market, the demographics of the market play a big role in the value of the weights. For example, credit card companies often evaluate different models for different areas of the country. Because of the sensitivity of the models, extreme care should be taken in the process of selecting the correct sample to validate the model for use. The same concern also applies to the scoring model's explanatory variables ( $X_{j}$ ). Specifically, due to changing financial market conditions, other borrower-specific financial ratios may come to be increasingly relevant in explaining default risk probabilities.

The third problem is that this model ignores important, hard-to-quantify factors that may play a crucial role in the default or no-default decision. For example, the reputation of the borrower and the nature of long-term borrower-lender relationships could be important borrower-specific characteristics, as could macro factors such as the phase of the business cycle. Credit-scoring models like the  $Z$ -score model often ignore these variables. Moreover, traditional credit-scoring models rarely use publicly available information, such as the prices of the outstanding public debt and equity of the borrower.

A fourth problem relates to the infrequency (e.g., quarterly or annually) with which accounting variables are updated. This allows scores to be changed at generally infrequent intervals.

Moody's Analytics Credit Monitor Model. In recent years, following the pioneering work on options by Merton, Black, and Scholes, we now recognize that when a firm raises funds either by issuing bonds or by increasing its bank loans, it holds a very valuable default or repayment option.[10] That is, if a borrower's investments fail to pay off, so that it cannot repay its bond holders or the loan to the FI, it has the option to default on its debt repayments and turn any remaining assets over to the debtholder. Because of limited liability, the borrower's loss is limited, on the downside, by the amount of equity that is invested in the firm. On the other hand, if things go well, the borrower can keep most of the upside returns on asset investments after the promised principal and interest on the debt have been paid. The KMV Corporation (purchased by Moody's in 2002 and now part of Moody's Analytics Enterprise Risk Solutions) has turned this relatively simple idea into a credit-monitoring model. Many of the largest U.S. banks are now using this model to determine the expected default frequency (EDF), that is, the probability of default, of large corporations.[11]


The expected default frequency that is calculated reflects the probability that the market value of the firm's assets will fall below the promised repayments on debt liabilities in one year. If the value of a firm's assets falls below its debt liabilities, it can be viewed as being economically insolvent. Simulations by Moody's Analytics have shown that this model outperforms both accounting-based models and S&P rating changes as predictors of corporate failure and distress.[12] An example for Peabody Energy Corp., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2016, is shown in Figure 21-2. Note that the Moody's Analytics score (EDF) is rising earlier than rating agencies are downgrading the firm's debt. Indeed, the rating agencies were very slow to react to, if not totally insensitive to, the increase in Peabody Energy risk. The Moody's Analytics EDF score starts to fall three years prior to Peabody Energy's bankruptcy and suggests a C rating by November 2013. Thus, the Moody's Analytics EDF score gives a better "early warning" of impending default. In an effort to get control over credit-rating firms that give high-quality ratings to

# CALCULATING THE RETURN ON A LOAN

LG 21-6

An important element in the credit management process, once the decision to make a loan has been made, is its pricing. This includes adjustments for the perceived credit risk or default risk of the borrower. This section demonstrates two ways to calculate the return on a loan: the traditional return on assets approach and a newer approach used by many FIs including banks, thrifts, and insurance companies called risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC), which considers loan returns in the context of the risk of the loan to the FI. While we demonstrate the return calculations using examples of commercial and industrial loans, the techniques can be used to calculate the return on other loans (such as credit card or mortgage loans) as well.

# Return on Assets (ROA)

A number of factors impact the promised return that an FI achieves on any given dollar loan (asset) amount. These factors include the following:

1. The interest rate on the loan.
2. Any fees relating to the loan.
3. The credit risk premium  $(m)$  on the loan.
4. The collateral backing the loan.
5. Other nonprice terms (such as compensating balances and reserve requirements).

In this section, we consider an example of how to calculate the promised return on a C&I loan. Suppose that an FI makes a spot one-year, 1 million loan. The loan rate is set as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text{Baselendingrate} (B R) = 8 \% \\ + \text{Riskpremium} (m) = 2 \% \\ B R + m = 10 \% \\ \end{array}

$$

# LIBOR

The London Interbank Offered Rate, the rate for interbank dollar loans in the foreign or Eurodollar market of a given maturity.

# prime lending rate

The base lending rate periodically set by banks.

# compensating balance

A proportion of a loan that a borrower is required to hold on deposit at the lending institution.

The base lending rate  $(BR)$  could reflect the FI's weighted average cost of capital or its marginal cost of funds, such as the commercial paper rate, the federal funds rate, or LIBOR—the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is the rate for interbank dollar loans in the foreign or Eurodollar market of a given maturity. Alternatively, the base lending rate could reflect the prime lending rate. Traditionally, the prime rate has been the rate charged to the bank's lowest risk customers. Now it is more a rate to which positive or negative risk premiums  $(m)$  can be added. In other words, FIs now charge their best and largest borrowers below prime rate to compete with the commercial paper market.

Direct and indirect fees and charges relating to a loan fall into three general categories:

1. A loan origination fee  $(f)$  charged to the borrower for processing the application.
2. A compensating balance requirement (b) to be held as generally non-interest-bearing demand deposits. Compensating balances represent a percentage of a loan that a borrower cannot actively use for expenditures. Instead, these balances must be kept on deposit at the FI. For example, a borrower facing a 10 percent compensating balance requirement on a  \$100 loan would have to place\$ 10 on deposit (traditionally in a demand deposit) with the FI and could use only \$90 of the \$100 borrowed. This requirement raises the effective cost of loans for the borrower since less than the full loan amount (90 in this case) can actually be used by the borrower and the deposit rate earned on compensating balances is less than the borrowing rate. Thus, compensating balance requirements act as an additional source of return on lending for an FI.[13]

3. A reserve requirement charge  $(RR)$  imposed by the Federal Reserve on the bank's demand deposits, including any compensating balances (see Chapter 13).

Although credit risk may be the most important factor ultimately affecting the return on a loan, FI managers should not ignore these other factors in evaluating loan profitability and risk. Indeed, FIs can compensate for high credit risk in a number of ways other than charging a higher explicit interest rate or risk premium on a loan or restricting the amount of credit available. In particular, higher fees, high compensating balances, and increased collateral backing offer implicit and indirect methods to compensate an FI for lending risk. Indeed, fee income has become increasingly important in the cost-benefit analysis of consumer and business lending. Consequently, the contractually promised gross return on the loan,  $k$ , per dollar lent (or  $1 + k$ )—or ROA per dollar lent—will equal:

$$

1 + k = 1 + \frac{f + (B R + m)}{1 - b (1 - R R)}

$$

The numerator of this formula is the promised gross cash inflow to the FI per dollar lent, reflecting direct fees  $(f)$  plus the loan interest rate  $(BR + m)$  discussed earlier. In the denominator, for every  \$1 that the FI lends, it retains b$  as non-interest-bearing compensating balances. Thus,  $1 - b$  represents the net proceeds of each 1 of loan received by the borrower from the FI, ignoring reserve requirements. However, since  $b$  (the compensating balance) is held by the borrower at the FI in a demand deposit account, the Federal Reserve requires the FI to hold non-(or low-)interest-bearing reserves at the rate  $RR$  against these compensating balances. Thus, the FI's net benefit from requiring compensating balances must consider the cost of holding additional reserves. The net outflow by the FI per \$1 of loans is, thus,  $1 - b(1 - RR)$ , or 1 minus the reserve-adjusted compensating balance requirement.

# EXAMPLE 21-5 Calculation of ROA on a Loan

Suppose a bank does the following:

1. Sets the loan rate on a prospective loan at 10 percent (where  $BR = 6\%$  and  $m = 4\%$ ).
2. Charges a  $\frac{1}{8}$  percent (or 0.125 percent) loan origination fee  $(f)$  to the borrower.
3. Imposes a 8 percent compensating balance requirement  $(b)$  to be held as non-interest-bearing demand deposits.
4. Sets aside reserves  $(RR)$  at a rate of 10 percent of deposits, held at the Federal Reserve (i.e., the Fed's cash-to-deposit reserve ratio is 10 percent).

Placing the numbers from our example into this formula, we have:

$$

1 + k = 1 + \frac{0 . 0 0 1 2 5 + (0 . 0 6 + 0 . 0 4)}{1 - (0 . 0 8) (0 . 9)}

$$

$$

1 + k = 1 + \frac{0 . 1 0 1 2 5}{0 . 9 2 8}

$$

$$

1 + k = 1.1091, \text{or} k = 10.91 \%

$$

This is, of course, larger than the simple promised interest return on the loan,  $BR + m = 10$  percent.

In the special case in which fees  $(f)$  are zero and the compensating balance  $(b)$  is zero:

$$ f = 0
$$

$$ b = 0
$$ the contractually promised return formula reduces to:


$$

1 + k = 1 + (B R + m)

$$

That is, the credit risk premium is the fundamental factor driving the promised return on a loan, once the base rate on the loan has been set.

Note that as commercial lending markets have become more competitive, both origination fees  $(f)$  and compensating balances  $(b)$  have become less important. For example, when compensating balances are still required, FIs may now allow them to be held as time deposits and earn interest. As a result, borrowers' opportunity losses from compensating balances have been reduced to the difference between the loan rate and the compensating balance time-deposit rate. In addition, compensating balance requirements are very rare on international loans such as Eurodollar loans. Finally, note that for a given promised gross return on a loan,  $k$ , F1 managers can use the pricing formula to find various combinations of fees, compensating balances, and risk premiums they may offer their customers that will generate the same returns.

# RAROC Models

An increasingly popular model used to evaluate the return on a loan to a large customer is the risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) model. Bankers Trust (acquired by Deutsche Bank in 1998) pioneered RAROC, which has now been adopted by virtually all the large banks in the United States and Europe, although with some proprietary differences among them.

The essential idea behind RAROC is that rather than evaluating the actual or promised annual cash flow on a loan as a percentage of the amount lent (or ROA), as described in the last subsection, the lending officer balances the loan's expected income against the loan's expected risk. Thus, the numerator of the RAROC equation is net income (or ROA - Cost of funding the loan) on the loan. Further, rather than dividing expected annual loan income by assets lent, it is divided by some measure of asset (loan) value at risk or what is often called value (or capital) at risk, since loan losses have to be written against an FI's capital (see Chapter 12):

$$

\mathrm{RA RO C} = \frac{\text{On e -y ea ri nc om eo na lo an}}{\text{Lo an (as se t)r is ko rv al ue at ri sk}}

$$

A loan is approved by the FI only if RAROC is sufficiently high relative to a benchmark return on equity capital, where ROE measures the return stockholders require on their equity investment in the FI. The idea here is that a loan should be made only if the risk-adjusted return on the loan adds to the FI's equity value as measured by the ROE required by the FI's stockholders. Thus, for example, if an FI's ROE is 10 percent, a loan should be made only if the estimated RAROC is higher than the 10 percent required by the FI's stockholders as a reward for their investment. Alternatively, if the RAROC on an existing loan falls below an FI's RAROC benchmark, the lending officer should seek to adjust the loan's terms (e.g., via the required loan rate or fees) to make it "profitable" again. Therefore, RAROC serves as both a credit-risk measure and a loan pricing tool for the FI manager.

One problem in estimating RAROC is the measurement of loan risk (the denominator in the RAROC equation). In calculating RAROC, most FIs divide one-year loan income by a loan risk measure calculated as the product of the dollar value of the loan, an "unexpected" default rate, and the proportion of the loan that cannot be recaptured on a borrower's default—the so-called loss given default. Thus,

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

8. What factors impact the rate of return on loans issued by FIs?
9. What the difference between the ROA and the RAROC on a loan is?

$$

\mathrm{RA RO C} = \frac{\text{On e -y ea ri nc om eo na lo an}}{\text{Do ll ar va lu eo fa lo an} \times \text{Un ex pe ct ed de fa ul tr at e} \times \text{Lo ss gi ve nd ef au lt}}

$$

The denominator in the RAROC equation is, therefore, an estimate of the unexpected overall loss on the loan in extreme conditions such as the worst year in the next 100 years, which is the product of the unexpected default rate and the loss given default.

# EXAMPLE 21-6 Calculation of RAROC

Suppose a borrower of  $100,000 has risk characteristics that put the firm in a risk class that has experienced an average historical default rate of 0.2 percent. However, one year in every 100 (or 1 percent of the time), such as in a major recession, the bank expects 4 percent of these types of loans to default. This 4 percent can be viewed as the unexpected or 1 in 100 years default rate.[15] Moreover, upon default, the FI has historically recovered only 20 percent of the defaulted loans. As a result, the loss given default is 80 percent. Accordingly, for this borrower, the loan loss risk per dollar lent is 0.032 = (0.04 \times 0.80)$ , or the value (or capital) at risk to the FI (the denominator of the RAROC equation) is 100,000(0.04 \times 0.80) = 3,200.

Suppose the cost of funds for the FI is 9.80 percent and the loan rate is 10 percent on the  \$100,000 loan. After adjusting for fees of 0.1 percent, the expected one-year income on the loan, or the numerator of the RAROC equation, is\$ 100,000 times 0.3 cents per dollar lent (10\% - 9.80\% + 0.10\%), or 0.003. The extreme case loss rate for borrowers of this type is 4 percent (i.e., the default that has or is projected to occur once in every 100 years), and the dollar proportion of loans of this type that cannot be recaptured on default (loss given default) has historically been 80 percent. Then:

$$

\mathrm{RAROC} = \frac{100,000(0.003)}{(100,000)(0.04)(0.8)} = \frac{300}{3,200} = 9.375\%

$$

If the FI's ROE is less than 9.375 percent (e.g., it is 9 percent), the loan can be viewed as being profitable. If the ROE is higher than 9.375 percent (e.g., 9.5 percent), it should be rejected and/or the loan officer should seek higher spreads and fees on the loan.[16]

15. Calculating the unexpected default rate commonly involves calculating the standard derivation  $(\sigma)$  of annual default rates on loans of this type and then multiplying  $\sigma$  by a factor such that 99 percent (or higher) of defaults are covered by capital. For example, if the loss distribution was normally distributed, then the  $\sigma$  of default rates would be multiplied by 2.33 to get the extreme 99 percent default rate. For many FIs, default rates are skewed to the right and have fat tails, suggesting a multiplier much larger than 2.33. Most FIs multiply the standard deviation by a number lying between 6 and 10 to pick up very large unexpected shocks to the borrowing firm. For example, to get coverage of 99.97 percent of defaults, Bank of America has historically used a multiplier of 6.

Using these ratios for Lake of Egypt Marina Inc. and the industry, what can you conclude about Lake of Egypt Marina's financial performance for 2022? (Ratios l, m, n, and o use net income available to common stockholders.)

9. Industrial Corporation has a net income-to-sales (profit margin) ratio of 0.03, a sales-to-assets (asset utilization) ratio of 1.5, and a debt-to-asset ratio of 0.66. What is Industrial's return on equity? (LG 21-4)
10. The following is ABC Inc.'s balance sheet (in thousands): (LG 21-5)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$ 20</td><td>Accounts payable</td><td>\$ 30</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivable</td><td>90</td><td>Notes payable</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory</td><td>90</td><td>Accruals</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Long-term debt</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and equipment</td><td>500</td><td>Equity</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$700</td><td>Total</td><td>$700</td></tr></table>

Also, sales equal 500, cost of goods sold equals 360, interest payments equal 62, taxes equal 56, and net income equals 22. The beginning retained earnings is 0, the market value of equity is equal to its book value, and the company pays no dividends.

a. Calculate Altman's  $Z$  score for ABC, Inc. if ABC has a 50 percent dividend payout ratio and the market value of equity is equal to its book value. Recall the following:

Net working capital  $=$  Current assets - Current liabilities
Current assets  $=$  Cash + Accounts receivable + Inventories
Current liabilities  $=$  Accounts payable + Accruals + Notes payable

<table><tr><td>EBIT = Revenues - Cost of goods sold - Depreciation</td></tr><tr><td>Taxes = (EBIT - Interest)(Tax rate)</td></tr><tr><td>Net income = EBIT - Interest - Taxes</td></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings = Net income(1 - Dividend payout ratio)</td></tr></table> b. Should you approve ABC Inc.'s application to your bank for 500,000 for a capital expansion loan?

c. If ABC's sales were  \$450,000, taxes were\$ 16,000, and the market value of equity fell to one-quarter of its book value (assume cost of goods sold and interest are unchanged), how would that change ABC's income statement? With the new data, does your credit decision change?
d. What are some of the shortcomings of using a discriminant function model to evaluate credit risk?

11. Suppose that the financial ratios of a potential borrowing firm took the following values:  $X_{1} =$  Net working capital/Total assets  $= 0.10$ ,  $X_{2} =$  Retained earnings/Total assets  $= 0.20$ ,  $X_{3} =$  Earnings before interest and taxes/Total assets  $= 0.22$ ,  $X_{4} =$  Market value of equity/Book value of long-term debt  $= 0.60$ ,  $X_{5} =$  Sales/Total assets ratio  $= 0.9$ . Calculate and interpret the Altman's  $Z$  score for this firm. (LG 21-5)
12. Countrybank offers 1-year loans with a stated rate of 10 percent but requires a compensating balance of 10 percent. What is the true cost of this loan to the borrower? (LG 21-6)
13. Metrobank offers 1-year loans with a 9 percent stated rate, charges a  $\frac{1}{4}$  percent loan origination fee, imposes a 10 percent compensating balance requirement, and must pay a 6 percent reserve requirement to the Federal Reserve. What is the return to the bank on these loans? (LG 21-6)
14. An FI is planning to give a loan of 5,000,000 to a firm in the steel industry. It expects to charge an up-front fee of 0.10 percent and a service fee of 5 basis points. The loan has a maturity of 8 years. The cost of funds (and the RAROC benchmark) for the FI is 10 percent. The FI has estimated the risk premium on the steel manufacturing sector to be approximately 0.18 percent, based on two years of historical data. The current market interest rate for loans in this sector is 10.1 percent. The 99th (extreme case) loss rate for borrowers of this type has historically run at 3 percent, and the dollar proportion of loans of this type that cannot be recaptured on default has historically been 90 percent. Using the RAROC model, should the FI make the loan? (LG 21-6)

The following problem is related to the Appendix material.

15. A bank has two loans of equal size outstanding, A and B, and the bank has identified the returns they would earn in two different states of nature, 1 and 2, representing default and no default, respectively.

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">State</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Security A</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.14</td></tr><tr><td>Security B</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.18</td></tr></table>

If the probability of state 1 is 0.2 and the probability of state 2 is 0.8, calculate: (LG 21-6) a. The expected return of each security.

b. The expected return on the portfolio in each state.
c. The expected return on the portfolio.
