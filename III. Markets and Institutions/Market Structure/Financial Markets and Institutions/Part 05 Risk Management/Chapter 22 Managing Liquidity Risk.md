# LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

This chapter looks at the problems created by liquidity risk. Unlike other risks that threaten the very solvency of an FI, liquidity risk is a normal aspect of the everyday management of an FI. For example, banks must manage liquidity so they can pay out cash as deposit holders request withdrawals of their funds. In extreme cases, liquidity risk problems develop into solvency risk problems. Moreover, some FIs are more exposed to liquidity risk than others. At one extreme, depository institutions are highly exposed. At the other extreme, mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, and property-casualty insurance companies have relatively low liquidity risk exposure. However, these FIs are certainly exposed to some liquidity risk. While the focus of the discussion is around liquidity risk at depository institutions, we discuss the unique aspects of liquidity risk in other types of institutions as well. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 was, in part, due to liquidity risk. As mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets started to experience large losses, credit markets froze and banks stopped lending to each other at anything but high overnight rates. The overnight London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR, a benchmark that reflects the rate at which banks lend to one another) more than doubled, rising from 2.57 percent on September 29, 2008, to an all-time high of 6.88 percent on September 30, 2009. Banks generally rely on each other for cash needed to meet their daily liquidity needs.

Interest rates on interbank borrowings are generally low because of confidence that financial institutions will repay each other. However, this confidence broke down during the financial crisis. Without interbank funding, banks became reluctant to lend to other credit markets, resulting in a more general and widespread liquidity crisis. To stem the post-2007 liquidity crisis, central banks around the world had to pump short-term cash into strained markets as they reeled amid the growing crisis that reshaped the contours of the global financial system.

# CAUSES OF LIQUIDITY RISK

LG 22-1

# fire-sale price

The price received for an asset that has to be liquidated (sold) immediately.

Liquidity risk arises for two reasons—a liability-side reason and an asset-side reason. The liability-side reason occurs when an FI's liability holders, such as depositors or insurance policyholders, seek to cash in their financial claims immediately. When liability holders demand cash by withdrawing deposits, the FI needs to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to meet the withdrawal. The most liquid asset is cash. FIs use this asset to pay claim holders who seek to withdraw funds. However, FIs tend to minimize their holdings of cash reserves as assets because those reserves pay no or little interest. To generate interest revenues, most FIs invest in less liquid and/or longer-maturity assets. While most assets can be turned into cash eventually, for some assets this can be done only at a high cost when the asset must be liquidated immediately. The price the asset holder must accept for immediate sale may be far less than it would receive with a longer horizon over which to negotiate a sale. Some assets may be liquidated only at low fire-sale prices, thus threatening the solvency of the FI. Alternatively, rather than liquidating assets, an FI may seek to purchase or borrow additional funds. However, replacing deposits with purchased funds may also be costly in that purchased funds would be obtained at relatively higher interest rates than what is paid on lost deposits.

The second cause of liquidity risk is asset-side liquidity risk, such as the ability to fund the exercise of off-balance-sheet loan commitments. As we describe in Chapter 12, a loan commitment allows a customer to borrow (take down) funds from an FI (over a commitment period) on demand. When a borrower draws on its loan commitment, the FI must fund the loan on the balance sheet immediately. This creates a demand for liquidity. As with liability withdrawals, an FI can meet such a liquidity need by running down its cash assets, selling off other liquid assets, or borrowing additional funds.

To understand the connection between liquidity risk and insolvency risk, consider the simple FI balance sheet in Table 22-1. Before deposit withdrawals, the FI has  \$10 million in cash assets and\$ 90 million in nonliquid assets. These assets are funded with \$90 million in deposits and \$10 million in owners' equity. Suppose that depositors unexpectedly withdraw \$20 million in deposits (perhaps due to the release of negative news about the profits of the FI) and the FI receives no new deposits to replace them. To meet these deposit withdrawals, the FI first uses the \$10 million it has in cash assets and then seeks to sell some of its nonliquid assets to raise an additional 10 million in cash. Suppose also that the FI cannot borrow any more funds in the short-term money markets (see Chapter 5), and because it cannot wait to get better prices for its assets in the future (as it needs the cash

now to meet immediate depositor withdrawals), the FI has to sell any nonliquid assets at 50 cents on the dollar. Thus, to cover the remaining \$10 million in deposit withdrawals, the FI must sell \$20 million in nonliquid assets, incurring a loss of \$10 million from the face value of those assets. The FI must then write off any such losses against its capital or equity funds. Since its capital was only \$10 million before the deposit withdrawal, the loss on the fire-sale of assets of 10 million leaves the FI economically insolvent (i.e., with zero equity capital or net worth).

# LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

# Liability-Side Liquidity Risk

As discussed in Chapter 11, a depository institution's (DI) balance sheet typically has a large amount of short-term liabilities, such as demand deposits and other transaction accounts, that fund relatively long-term, illiquid assets such as commercial loans and mortgages. Demand deposit accounts and other transaction accounts are contracts that give the holders the right to put their financial claims back to the DI on any given day and demand immediate repayment of the face value in cash. Thus, an individual demand deposit account holder with a balance of \$10,000 can demand to be repaid immediately in cash, as can a corporation with \$100 million in its demand deposit account. In theory, at least, a DI that has 50 percent of its liabilities in demand deposits and other transaction accounts must stand ready to pay out the entire amount by liquidating an equivalent amount of assets (or borrowing additional funds) on any given banking day.

# core deposits

Deposits that provide a relatively stable, long-term funding source to a depository institution.

# net deposit drain

The amount by which cash withdrawals exceed additions; a net cash outflow.

In reality, a DI knows that normally only a small proportion of its demand deposits will be withdrawn on any given day. Most demand deposits remain with the DI, thus behaving as core deposits on a day-by-day basis, providing a relatively stable or long-term source of funding for the DI. Moreover, deposit withdrawals may in part be offset by the inflow of new deposits. The DI manager must monitor the resulting net deposit withdrawals or net deposit drains. Specifically, over time a DI manager can normally predict— with a good degree of accuracy—the probability of different-sized net deposit drains (the difference between deposit withdrawals and deposit additions) on any given banking day.

For example, suppose the probability distribution of net deposit drains is strongly peaked at the 5 percent net (deposit) withdrawal level—this DI expects approximately 5 percent of its net deposit funds to be withdrawn on any given day with the highest probability. Assume also that the distribution has a standard deviation of 1 percent. If the distribution is normal, we can state with 95 percent confidence that the rate of deposits withdrawals will be between 3 percent and 7 percent (i.e., plus or minus two standard deviations). A net deposit drain means that a DI is receiving insufficient additional deposits (and other cash inflows) to offset deposit withdrawals, which means that the liability side of its balance sheet is contracting. Table 22-2 illustrates a 5 percent, equal to 3.5 million, net deposit drain.

1. Accounts with this type of put option include demand deposits, NOW accounts (interest-bearing checking accounts with minimum balance requirements), and money market accounts (interest-bearing checking accounts with minimum balance requirements and restrictions as to the number of checks written). We describe these accounts in more detail in Chapter 12. Banks typically liquidate deposit account contracts immediately upon request of the customer. Many deposit account contracts, however, give a bank some powers to delay withdrawals by requiring notification of withdrawal a certain number of days before withdrawal or by imposing penalty fees such as loss of interest.

LG 22-2

An FI can manage a drain on deposits in two major ways: (1) purchased liquidity management and/or (2) stored liquidity management. Traditionally, DI managers relied on stored liquidity as the primary mechanism of liquidity management. Today, many DIs—especially the largest banks with access to the money market and other nondeposit markets for funds—rely on purchased liquidity. Smaller DIs—such as community banks—more often look to stored liquidity.

# purchased liquidity management

An adjustment to a deposit drain that occurs on the liability side of the balance sheet.

Purchased Liquidity Management. A DI manager who purchases liquidity to offset a deposit drain turns to the markets for purchased funds, such as the federal funds market and/or the repurchase (repo) agreement markets (discussed in Chapter 5), which are interbank markets for short-term loans. Alternatively, a DI manager could issue additional fixed-maturity certificates of deposit (see Chapter 12) or additional notes and bonds. For example, the DI in Table 22-2 could fully fund its net deposit drain as long as the total amount of the funds raised equals 3.5 million. This can be expensive for the DI, however, since it must pay market rates for funds to offset net drains on low interest rate deposits. Thus, the higher the cost of purchased funds relative to rates earned on assets, the less attractive this approach to liquidity management becomes. Further, since most of these purchased funds are not covered by deposit insurance, their availability may be limited should the DI incur insolvency difficulties. Table 22-3 shows the DI's balance sheet if it responds to deposit drains by using purchased liquidity techniques.

Note that purchased liquidity management has allowed the DI to maintain its overall balance sheet size of 100 million without disturbing the size and composition of the asset side of its balance sheet—that is, the complete adjustment to the deposit drain occurs on the liability side of the balance sheet. In other words, purchased liquidity management can insulate the asset side of the balance sheet from normal drains on the liability side of the balance sheet. This is one of the reasons for the enormous growth in recent years of DI-purchased liquidity management techniques and associated purchased fund markets such as fed funds, repurchase agreements, and CDs among DIs. (We describe and discuss these instruments and markets in Chapter 5.) In the early 2000s regulators expressed concerns about the increased use of these (wholesale) funding sources by DIs. Indeed, with the liquidity crunch experienced during the financial crisis, additional (wholesale) funds were hard, and sometimes impossible, to obtain.

# stored liquidity management

An adjustment to a deposit drain that occurs on the asset side of the balance sheet.

Stored Liquidity Management. Instead of meeting the net deposit drain by purchasing liquidity in the money markets, the DI can use stored liquidity management. That is, the FI can liquidate some of its assets, thus utilizing its stored liquidity. U.S. banks traditionally have held or "stored" cash reserves in their vaults and at the Federal Reserve for this very purpose. The Federal Reserve sets a minimum requirement for the cash reserves that banks must hold (see Chapter 13). Even so, banks still tend to hold cash reserves in excess of the minimum required amount to meet liquidity drains.

Suppose in our example that on the asset side of the balance sheet the DI normally holds 9 million of its assets in cash (of which 3 million is to meet Federal Reserve minimum reserve requirements and 6 million is an "excess" cash reserve). We depict the situation before the net drain in liabilities in Table 22-4. As depositors withdraw 3.5 million in deposits, the DI meets this by using the excess cash stored in its vaults or held on deposit at other DIs or at the Federal Reserve. If the reduction of 3.5 million in deposit liabilities is met by a 3.5 million reduction in cash assets held by the DI, its balance sheet is as shown in Table 22-5.

When the DI uses its cash as the liquidity adjustment mechanism, both sides of its balance sheet contract. In this example, both the DI's total assets and liabilities/equity shrink from  \$100 million to\$ 96.5 million. The cost to the DI of using stored liquidity, apart from decreased asset size, is that it must hold excess low interest rate assets in the form of cash on its balance sheet.4 Thus, the cost of using cash to meet liquidity needs is the forgone return (or opportunity cost) of being unable to invest these funds in loans and other higher income-earning assets.

Finally, note that although stored liquidity management and purchased liquidity management are alternative strategies for meeting deposit drains, a DI can combine the two methods by using some purchased liquidity management and some stored liquidity management to meet liquidity needs.

# EXAMPLE 22-1 Impact of Stored Liquidity versus Purchased Liquidity Management on a DI's Net Income

Suppose a DI has the following balance sheet:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$ 1m (equal to required reserves)</td><td>Core deposits</td><td>\$ 6m</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>9m</td><td>Subordinated debt</td><td>2m</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td>2m</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$10m</td><td></td><td>$10m</td></tr></table>

The average cost of core deposits is 6 percent and the average yield on loans is 8 percent. Increases in interest rates are expected to cause a net drain of 2 million in core deposits over the next six months. New short-term debt (such as subordinated debt) can be obtained at a cost of 7.5 percent. If the DI uses stored liquidity management to manage liquidity risk, it reduces its loan portfolio (selling loans for cash) to offset this expected decline in deposits. Assuming there is no capital loss on the sale of the loans, the DI's net income will change as follows:

Decrease in interest income-loans

$$
- 0. 0 8 \times \$ 2 \mathrm{m} = - \$ 1 6 0, 0 0 0
$$

Decrease in interest expense-core deposits

$$
- (- 0. 0 6) \times \$ 2 m = \$ 1 2 0, 0 0 0
$$

Change in net income

$$
- \$ 40,000
$$

If the DI uses purchased liquidity management to manage liquidity risk, it issues short-term, subordinated debt to pay off the expected decline in deposits. In this case, the DI's net income will change by:

Decrease in interest expense-core deposits

$$
- 0. 0 6 \times \$ 2 \mathrm{m} = \quad \$ 1 2 0, 0 0 0
$$

Increase in interest expense—short-term debt

$$
- (- 0. 0 7 5) \times \$ 2 \mathrm{m} = - \$ 1 5 0, 0 0 0
$$

Change in net income

$$
- \$ 3 0, 0 0 0
$$

The DI is more profitable if it manages the drain in core deposits using purchased liquidity management. The decrease in net income is  \$30,000 versus\$ 40,000 if it uses stored liquidity management.

# Asset-Side Liquidity Risk

Just as deposit drains can cause a DI liquidity problems, so can loan requests, resulting from the exercise, by borrowers, of loan commitments and other credit lines. In recent years, depository institutions—especially commercial banks—increased their loan commitments tremendously, with the belief they would not be exercised. Unused loan commitments to cash grew from 529.4 percent in 1994 to 1014.6 percent in October 2008 (before falling back to 608.6 percent during the financial crisis). Table 22-6 shows the effect of a  \$5 million exercise of a loan commitment by a borrower. As a result, the DI must fund\$ 5 million in additional loans on the balance sheet. Consider the Before columns in Table 22-6 (the balance sheet before the commitment exercise) and the After columns (as the loan is added to the balance sheet after the exercise). In particular, the exercise of the loan commitment means that the DI needs to provide \$5 million immediately to the borrower (nonliquid assets increase from $91 to $96 million). This can be done either by purchased liquidity management (borrowing an additional \$5 million in the money market and lending these funds to the borrower) or by stored liquidity management (decreasing the DI's excess cash assets from \$9 million to \$4 million). We present balance sheets that result from each of these two policies in Table 22-7.

# Measuring a DI's Liquidity Exposure

Having discussed the sources of liquidity risk for a DI, we next look at several methods currently used to measure the extent of a DI's liquidity risk exposure. These methods take into account the DI's excess cash reserves and its ability to raise additional purchased funds.

# financing gap

The difference between a DI's average loans and average (core) deposits.

Financing Gap and the Financing Requirement. A first way to measure liquidity risk exposure is to determine the DI's financing gap. As we discussed earlier, even though demand depositors can withdraw their funds immediately, they do not do so in normal circumstances. On average, most demand deposits stay at DIs for quite long periods, often two years or more. Thus, a DI manager often thinks of the average deposit base, including demand deposits, as a core source of funds that over time can fund a DI's average amount of loans. We define a financing gap as the difference between a DI's average loans and average (core) deposits, or:

$$
\text{Fi na nc in g} = \text{Av er ag el oa ns -A ve ra ge de po si ts}
$$

If this financing gap is positive, the DI must find liquidity to fund the gap. This funding can come via either purchased liquidity management (i.e., borrowing funds) or stored liquidity management (i.e., liquidating assets), as discussed previously. Thus:

$$
\text{Fi na nc in g} = - \text{Li qu id as se ts} + \text{Bo rr ow ed fu nd s}
$$

We can write this relationship as:

Financing gap + Liquid assets = Financing requirement (borrowed funds)

# financing requirement

The financing gap plus a DI's liquid assets.

As expressed in this fashion, the liquidity and managerial implications of the financing requirement (the financing gap plus a DI's liquid assets) are that the level of core deposits and loans as well as the amount of liquid assets determines the DI's borrowing or purchased fund needs. In particular, the larger a DI's financing gap and liquid asset holdings, the higher the amount of funds it needs to borrow in the money markets and the greater is its exposure to liquidity problems from such a reliance.

The balance sheet in Table 22-8 indicates the relationship between the financing gap, liquid assets, and the borrowed funds financing requirement. This is seen in the following equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text{Fi na nc in gg ap} & + \text{Li qu id as se ts} \\ (\S 5 \text{mi ll on}) & (\S 5 \text{mi ll on}) \end{array} = \begin{array}{l} \text{Fi na nc in gr eq ui re me nt} \\ (\S 1 0 \text{mi ll on}) \end{array}
$$

A widening financing gap can warn of future liquidity problems for a DI since it may indicate increased deposit withdrawals (core deposits falling below  \$20 million in Table 22-8) and increasing loans due to more exercise of loan commitments (loans rising above\$ 25 million). If the DI does not reduce its liquid assets—that is, if they stay at 5 million—the manager must resort to more money market borrowings. As these borrowings rise, sophisticated lenders in the money market may be concerned about the DI's creditworthiness. They may react by imposing higher-risk premiums on borrowed funds or establishing stricter credit limits by not rolling over funds lent to the DI. If the DI's financing requirements dramatically exceed such limits, it may become insolvent.

Sources and Uses of Liquidity. As discussed earlier, a DI's liquidity risk arises from the ongoing conducting of business, such as a withdrawal of deposits or new loan demand, and the subsequent need to meet these demands by liquidating assets or borrowing funds. Therefore, a second measure of liquidity risk exposure a DI manager might use to measure the DI's liquidity position on a daily basis is a net liquidity statement. A net liquidity statement lists sources and uses of liquidity and, thus, provides a measure of a DI's net liquidity position. Such a statement for a hypothetical U.S. bank is presented in Table 22-9.

The DI can obtain liquid funds in three ways. First, it can sell its liquid assets such as T-bills immediately with little price risk and low transaction costs. Second, it can borrow funds in the money/purchased funds market up to a maximum amount (this is an internal guideline based on the manager's assessment of the credit limits that the purchased or borrowed funds market is likely to impose on the bank). Third, it can use any excess cash reserves over and above the amount held to meet regulatory imposed reserve requirements. In Table 22-9, the DI's sources of liquidity total  \$14,500 million. Compare this to the DI's uses of liquidity—in particular, the amount of borrowed or purchased funds it has already utilized (e.g., fed funds, RPs borrowed) and the amount of cash it has already borrowed from the Federal Reserve through discount window loans. These total\$ 7,000 million. As a result, the DI has a positive net liquidity position of 7,500 million. These liquidity sources and uses can be tracked easily on a day-by-day basis.

The net liquidity position in Table 22-9 lists management's expected sources and uses of liquidity for a hypothetical bank. All DIs report their historical sources and uses of liquidity in their annual and quarterly reports. Appendix 22A to this chapter (available through Connect or your course instructor) presents 2019 Statement of Cash Flows for JPMorgan Chase. As a DI manager deals with liquidity risk, historical sources and uses of liquidity statements can be useful tools for determining where future liquidity issues may arise.

Peer Group Ratio Comparisons. A third way to measure a DI's liquidity exposure is to compare certain of its key ratios and balance sheet features—such as loans to deposits, core deposits to total assets, borrowed funds to total assets, and commitments to lend to assets ratios—with those for DIs of a similar size and geographic location (see Chapter 12). A high ratio of loans to deposits and borrowed funds to total assets and/or a low ratio of core deposits to total assets means that the DI relies heavily on the short-term money market rather than on core deposits to fund loans. This could mean future liquidity problems if the DI is at or near its borrowing limits in the purchased funds market. Similarly, a high ratio of loan commitments to assets indicates the need for a high degree of liquidity to fund any unexpected takedowns of these loans by customers—thus, high-commitment DIs often face more liquidity risk exposure than do low-commitment DIs.

Table 22-10 lists the 2019 values of these ratios for the banks we reviewed in Chapter 12: Heartland Bank and Trust Company (HBT) and Bank of America Corporation (BOA). Neither of these banks relied heavily on borrowed funds (short-term money market

Their ratio of borrowed funds to total assets was 2.45 percent and 7.74 percent, respectively. Their ratio of core deposits (the stable deposits of the DI, such as demand deposits, NOW accounts, MMDAs, other savings accounts, and retail CDs) to total assets, on the other hand, was 81.86 percent and 78.49 percent, respectively. As a major money center bank, Bank of America gets slightly more of its liquid funds from the borrowed funds markets than core deposit markets. HBT, a smaller, consumer-oriented bank, uses core deposits much more than borrowed funds to get its liquid funds. Further, the ratios of loans to deposits for HBT and BOA were 83.52 percent and 65.76 percent, respectively. The result is that Bank of America is subject to less liquidity risk than HBT. Furthermore, HBT had a ratio of loan commitments to total assets of only 16.34 percent, while BOA had a much greater ratio of 46.62 percent. If these commitments are taken down (see Chapters 11 and 20), BOA must come up with the cash to fulfill these commitments, more so than HBT. Thus, BOA was exposed to substantially greater liquidity risk from unexpected takedowns of these commitments.

A measure of the potential losses a DI could suffer as the result of a sudden (or fire-sale) disposal of assets.

Liquidity Index. A final way to measure liquidity risk is to use a liquidity index. This index measures the potential losses a DI could suffer from a sudden or fire-sale disposal of assets compared to the amount it would receive at a fair market value established under normal market conditions, which might take a lengthy period of time as a result of a careful search and bidding process. The larger the differences between immediate fire-sale asset prices  $(P_{i})$  and fair market prices  $\left(P_{i}^{*}\right)$ , the less liquid is the DI's portfolio of assets. Define an index I such that:

$$
\mathrm{I} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} [ (w_{i}) (P_{i} / P_{i}^{*}) ]
$$ where


$w_{i} =$  Percentage of each asset in the DI's portfolio

$$

\sum w_{i} = 1

$$

$P_{i} =$  Price if a DI liquidates asset  $i$  today

$P_{i}^{*} = \text{Priceifa DIliquidatesasset } i \text{ atsomefuturepointintime (e.g.,inonemonth)}$

The liquidity index will always lie between 0 and 1. The liquidity index for a particular DI could also be compared with indexes calculated for a peer group of similar DIs.

# EXAMPLE 22-2 Calculation of the Liquidity Index

Suppose that a bank has two assets: 50 percent in one-month Treasury bills and 50 percent in real estate loans. If the bank must liquidate its T-bills today (P1), it receives $99 per $100 of face value. If it can wait to liquidate them on maturity (in one month's time), it will receive the fair market price of $100 per $100 of face value (P1*). If the bank has to liquidate its real estate loans today, it receives $85 per $100 of face value (P2). Liquidation at the end of one month (closer to maturity) will result in a fair market price of 92 per

100 of face value (P_2^*). Thus, the one-month liquidity index value for this bank's asset portfolio is:

$$

\begin{array}{l} I = (1 / 2) (0. 9 9 / 1. 0 0) + (1 / 2) (0. 8 5 / 0. 9 2) \\ = 0. 4 9 5 + 0. 4 6 2 \\ = 0. 9 5 7 \\ \end{array}

$$

Suppose alternatively that a slow or thin real estate market causes the bank to be able to liquidate the real estate loans at only 65 per 100 of face value (P_2) on an immediate sale. The one-month liquidity index for the bank's asset portfolio is:

$$

\begin{array}{l} I = (1 / 2) (0. 9 9 / 1. 0 0) + (1 / 2) (0. 6 5 / 0. 9 2) \\ = 0. 4 9 5 + 0. 3 5 3 \\ = 0. 8 4 8 \\ \end{array}

$$

The value of the one-month liquidity index decreases due to the larger discount on the immediate or fire-sale price—from the fair (full value) market price of real estate—over the one-month period. The larger the discount from fair value, the smaller the liquidity index or higher the liquidity risk the bank faces.

# New Liquidity Risk Measures Implemented by the Bank for International Settlements.

During the financial crisis, many DIs struggled to maintain adequate liquidity. Indeed, extraordinary levels of liquidity assistance were required from central banks in order to maintain the financial system. Even with this extensive support, a number of DIs failed or were forced into mergers. Recognizing the need for DIs to improve their liquidity risk management and control their liquidity risk exposure, the Bank for International Settlement's (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision developed two new regulatory standards for liquidity risk supervision. The standards are intended to "enhance tools, metrics, and benchmarks that supervisors can use to assess the resilience of banks' liquidity cushions and constrain any weakening in liquidity maturity profiles, diversity of funding sources, and stress testing practices."5 The two new liquidity ratios to be maintained by DIs are the liquidity coverage ratio (implemented in 2019) and the net stable funds ratio (implemented in 2018). The rule applies to large, internationally active banking organizations with  \$250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or\$ 10 billion or more in total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure, and to consolidated subsidiary depository institutions of these banking organizations with 10 billion or more in total assets.

The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) aims to ensure that a DI maintains an adequate level of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-day time horizon under an "acute liquidity stress scenario" specified by supervisors. The specified scenario incorporates both institution-specific and systemic shocks that are based on actual circumstances experienced in the global financial crisis. Thus, maintenance of the LCR is intended to ensure that DIs can survive a severe liquidity stress scenario for at least 30 days. The LCR, which is reported to DI supervisors monthly, is as follows:

$$

\text{Liquiditycoverageratio} = \frac{\text{Stockofhigh -qualityliquidassets}}{\text{Totalnetcashoutflowsoverthenext30calendardays}} \geq 100 \%

$$

The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) takes a longer-term look at liquidity on a DI's balance sheet. The NSFR evaluates liquidity over the entire balance sheet and provides incentives for DIs to use stable sources of financing. This longer-term liquidity ratio requires that a minimum amount of stable funding be held over a one-year time horizon based on liquidity risk factors assigned to liquidity exposures of on-and off-balance-sheet assets.

The NSFR is intended to ensure that long-term assets are funded with stable liabilities. It limits reliance on short-term wholesale funding, which was a major problem in the financial crisis. Basically, stable funding is sought for all illiquid assets and securities held, where stable funding is defined as equity and liability financing that is expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR ratio, which will be reported to DI supervisors quarterly starting in 2018, is:

$$

\text{Netstablefundingratio} = \frac{\text{Availableamountofstablefunding}}{\text{Requiredamountofstablefunding}} >100\%

$$

Appendix 22B (available through Connect or your course instructor) provides more detail on how to calculate these two additional measures of liquidity risk.

In 2013, the BIS also introduced additional guidelines for monitoring intraday liquidity risk at internationally active banks. The guidelines specify six operational elements that should be included in a bank's strategy for managing intraday liquidity risk. According to these guidelines, banks should:

1. Have the capacity to measure expected daily gross liquidity inflows and outflows, anticipate the intraday timing of these flows where possible, and forecast the range of potential net funding shortfalls that might arise at different points during the day.
2. Have the capacity to monitor intraday liquidity positions against expected activities and available resources (balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, available collateral).
3. Arrange to acquire sufficient intraday funding to meet intraday objectives.
4. Have the ability to manage and mobilize collateral as necessary to obtain intraday funds.
5. Have a robust capability to manage the timing of liquidity outflows in line with intraday objectives.
6. Be prepared to deal with unexpected disruptions to intraday liquidity flows.

Liquidity Planning. Liquidity planning is a key component in measuring (and being able to deal with) liquidity risk and its associated costs. Specifically, liquidity planning allows managers to make important borrowing priority decisions before liquidity problems arise. Such forward planning can lower the cost of funds (by determining an optimal funding mix) and can minimize the amount of excess reserves that a DI needs to hold.

A liquidity plan has a number of components. The first component is the delineation of managerial details and responsibilities. Responsibilities are assigned to key management personnel should a liquidity crisis occur. The plan identifies those managers responsible for interacting with various regulatory agencies such as the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). It also specifies areas of managerial responsibility in disclosing information to the public, including depositors. The second component of a liquidity plan is a detailed list of fund providers most likely to withdraw as well as the pattern of fund withdrawals. For example, in a crisis, financial institutions such as mutual funds and pension funds are more likely than correspondent banks and small business corporations to withdraw funds quickly from banks and thrifts. In turn, correspondent banks and small corporations are more likely than individual depositors to withdraw funds quickly. This makes liquidity exposure sensitive to the effects of future funding composition changes. In addition, FIs such as depository institutions face particularly heavy seasonal withdrawals of deposits in the quarter before Christmas. The third component of liquidity planning is the identification of the size of potential deposit and fund withdrawals over various time horizons in the future (one week, one month, one quarter, etc.) as well as alternative private market funding sources to meet such withdrawals (e.g., emergency loans from other FIs and the Federal Reserve). The fourth component of the plan sets internal limits on separate subsidiaries' and branches' borrowings as well as bounds for acceptable risk premiums to pay in each market (fed funds, RPs, CDs, etc.).

In addition, the plan details a sequencing of assets for disposal in anticipation of various degrees or intensities of deposit/fund withdrawals. Such a plan may evolve from a DI's asset-liability management committee and may be relayed to various key departments of the DI (e.g., the money desk and the treasury department) that play vital day-to-day roles in liability funding.

Consider, for example, Table 22-11. The data are for a DI that holds 250 million in deposits from mutual funds, pension funds, correspondent banks, small businesses, and individuals. The table includes the average and maximum expected withdrawals over the next one-week, one-month, and one-quarter periods. The liquidity plan for the DI outlines how to cover expected deposit withdrawals should they materialize. In this case, the DI will seek to cover expected deposit withdrawals over the next three months first with new deposits, then with the liquidation of marketable securities in its investment portfolio, then with borrowings from other FIs, and finally, if necessary, with borrowings from the Federal Reserve.

# Liquidity Risk, Unexpected Deposit Drains, and Bank Runs

Under normal banking conditions, and with appropriate management planning, neither net deposit withdrawals nor the exercise of loan commitments poses significant liquidity problems for DIs. This is because, typically, borrowed funds availability or excess cash reserves are adequate to meet anticipated needs. For example, even in December and the summer vacation season, when net deposit withdrawals are high, DIs anticipate these seasonal effects by holding larger than normal excess cash reserves or borrowing more than normal on the wholesale money markets.

Major liquidity problems can arise, however, if deposit drains are abnormally large and unexpected. Abnormal deposit drains may occur for a number of reasons, including:

1. Concerns about a DI's solvency relative to that of other DIs.
2. Failure of a related DI, leading to heightened depositor concerns about the solvency of surviving DIs (a contagion effect).
3. Sudden changes in investor preferences regarding holding nonbank financial assets (such as T-bills or mutual fund shares) relative to DI deposits.

LG 22-5

# bank run

A sudden and unexpected increase in deposit withdrawals from a DI.

In such cases, sudden and unexpected surges in net deposit withdrawals risk triggering a bank run, which could force a DI into insolvency.

Deposit Drains and Bank Run Liquidity Risk. At the core of bank run liquidity risk is the fundamental and unique nature of the demand deposit contract. Specifically, demand deposit contracts are first-come, first-served contracts in the sense that a depositor's place in line determines the amount he or she will be able to withdraw from a DI. For example, suppose that a DI has 100 depositors, each of whom deposited  \$1. Suppose that each has a reason to believe—correctly or incorrectly—that the DI has assets worth only\$ 90 on its balance sheet. A frequent reason for depositors to believe this is the announcement of trouble in the DI's loan portfolio. As a result, each depositor has an incentive to be the first to go to the DI and withdraw his or her \$1 deposit because the DI pays depositors sequentially as it liquidates its assets. If it has \$90 in assets, it can pay in full only the first 90 depositors in the line. The 10 depositors at the end of the line get nothing at all. Thus, demand deposits are in essence either full-pay or no-pay contracts.

Because demand deposit contracts pay in full only a certain proportion of depositors when a DI's assets are valued at less than its deposits—and because depositors realize this—any line outside a DI encourages other depositors to join the line immediately even if they do not need cash today for normal consumption purposes. Thus, even the DI's core depositors, who really do not need to withdraw deposits for current consumption needs, rationally seek to withdraw their funds immediately when they observe a sudden increase in the lines at their DI.

As a bank run develops, the demand for net deposit withdrawals grows. The DI may initially meet this by decreasing its cash reserves, selling off liquid or readily marketable assets such as T-bills and T-bonds, and seeking to borrow in the money markets. As a bank run increases in intensity, more depositors join the withdrawal line, and a liquidity crisis develops. Specifically, the DI finds it difficult, if not impossible, to borrow in the money markets at virtually any price. Also, it has sold all its liquid assets, cash, and bonds as well as any salable loans (see Chapter 25). The DI is likely to have left only relatively illiquid loans on the asset side of the balance sheet to meet depositor claims for cash. However, these loans can be sold or liquidated only at very large discounts from face value. A DI needing to liquidate long-term assets at fire-sale prices to meet continuing deposit drains faces the strong possibility that the proceeds from such asset sales will be insufficient to meet depositors' cash demands. The DI's liquidity problem then turns into a solvency problem; that is, the DI must close its doors.

The incentives for depositors to run first and ask questions later create a fundamental instability in the banking system, in that an otherwise sound DI can be pushed into insolvency and failure by unexpectedly large depositor drains and liquidity demands. This is especially so in periods of contagious runs or bank panics (such as the panic involving the Greek debt and banking crisis of 2010), when depositors lose faith in the banking system as a whole and engage in a run on all DIs in a banking system.

# bank panic

A systemic or contagious run on the deposits of the banking industry as a whole.

# Bank Runs, the Discount Window, and Deposit Insurance

Regulators have recognized the inherent instability of the banking system due to the all-or-nothing payoff features of deposit contracts. As a result, regulatory mechanisms are in place to ease DIs' liquidity problems and to deter bank runs and panics. The two major liquidity risk insulation mechanisms are deposit insurance and the discount window.

Deposit Insurance. Because of the serious effects that a contagious run on DIs could have on the economy (e.g., inability to transfer wealth from period to period, inability to implement monetary policy, inability to allocate credit to various sectors of the economy in special need of financing—see Chapter 1), government regulators of depository institutions have established guarantee programs offering deposit holders varying degrees of insurance protection www.fdic.gov


to deter runs. Specifically, the FDIC was created in 1933 in the wake of the banking panics of 1930-1933, when some 10,000 commercial banks failed. The original level of individual depositor insurance coverage at depository institutions was  \$2,500, which was increased (six times since 1934) to\$ 100,000 in 1980, and to 250,000 in October 2008. With deposit insurance guarantees in place, if a deposit holder believes his or her claim is totally secure, even if the DI is in trouble, the holder has no incentive to run. The deposit holder's place in line no longer affects his or her ability to retrieve funds deposited in the DI. Thus, deposit insurance deters runs as well as contagious runs and panics.

During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, in an attempt to deter bank runs and panics and thus provide stability to the U.S. banking system, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (or TARP) gave the U.S. Treasury funds to buy "toxic" mortgages and other securities from financial institutions and also called for the FDIC to increase deposit insurance to  \$250,000 from\$ 100,000 per person per institution. The \$250,000 cap concerns a depositor's beneficial interest and ownership of deposited funds. In actuality, by structuring deposit funds in a DI in a particular fashion, a depositor can achieve many times the \$250,000 coverage cap on deposits. To see this, consider the different categories of deposit fund ownership available to an individual shown in Table 22-12. Each of these categories represents a distinct accumulation of funds toward the 250,000 insurance cap. Note the coverage ceiling is per DI.

# TABLE 22-12 Deposit Ownership Categories
- Individual ownership, such as a simple checking account.
- Joint ownership, such as the savings account of a husband and wife.
- Revocable trusts, in which the beneficiary is a qualified relative of the settlor, and the settlor has the ability to alter or eliminate the trust.
- Irrevocable trusts whose beneficial interest is not subject to being altered or eliminated.
- Employee benefit plans whose interests are vested and thus not subject to being altered or eliminated.
- Public units—accounts of federal, state, and municipal governments.
Corporations and partnerships.
- Unincorporated businesses and associates.
- Individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
Keogh accounts.
- Executor or administrator accounts.
- Accounts held by DIs in an agency or fiduciary capacity.

# EXAMPLE 22-3 Calculation of Insured Deposits

A married couple with one child and with individual retirement account (IRA) and Keogh private pension plans for both the husband and the wife at the DI could accrue a total coverage cap of 2.0 million as a family:

Husband's deposit account 250,000

Wife's deposit account 250,000

Joint deposit account 250,000

Child's deposit account held in trust 250,000

Husband's IRA 250,000

Wife's IRA 250,000

Husband's Keogh account 250,000

Wife's Keogh account 250,000

Total deposit insurance coverage  $\$ 2,000,000$

By expanding the range of ownership in this fashion, the coverage cap for a family per DI can rapidly approach 2 million or more.

www.federalreserve.gov

The primary intention of deposit insurance is to deter DI runs and panics. A secondary and related objective has been to protect the smaller, less informed saver against the reduction in wealth that would occur if that person were last in line were the DI to fail. Under the current deposit insurance contract, the small, less informed depositor is defined by the  \$250,000 ceiling. Theoretically at least, larger, more informed depositors with more than\$ 250,000 on deposit are at risk if a DI fails. As a result, these large uninsured depositors should be sensitive to DI risk and seek to discipline riskier DIs by demanding higher interest rates on their deposits or withdrawing their deposits completely. Until recently, the manner in which DI failures have been resolved meant that both large and small depositors were often fully protected against losses. This was especially so where large banks got into trouble and were viewed as too-big-to-fail. That is, they were too big to be liquidated by regulators either because of the draining effects on the resources of the insurance fund or for fear of contagious or systemic runs spreading to other major banks. Thus, although uninsured depositors tended to lose in thrift and small-bank failures, in large-bank failures the failure resolution methods employed by regulators usually resulted in implicit 100 percent deposit insurance. As a result, for large banks in particular, neither small nor large depositors had sufficient incentives to impose market discipline on riskier banks.

The Discount Window. Deposit insurance is not the only mechanism by which regulators mitigate DI liquidity risk. A second mechanism has been the central banks' provision of a lender of last resort facility through the discount window. Suppose that a DI has an unexpected deposit drain near the end of a reserve requirement period but cannot meet its reserve target (see Chapter 13). It can seek to borrow from the central bank's discount window facility to offset this liquidity drain. Alternatively, discount window loans can also meet short-term seasonal liquidity needs due to crop-planting cycles. Normally, DIs make such loans by discounting short-term high-quality securities such as Treasury bills and banker's acceptances with the central bank. The interest rate at which such securities are discounted is called the discount rate and is set by the central bank.

In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Reserve's discount window supplied funds to the banking system in unprecedented amounts. The magnitude of destruction resulting from the attacks caused severe disruptions to the U.S. banking system, particularly in DIs' abilities to send electronic payments. The physical disruptions caused by the attacks included outages of telephone switching equipment in lower Manhattan's financial district, impaired records processing and communications systems at individual banks, the evacuation of buildings that were the sites for the payment operations of several large DIs, and the suspended delivery of checks by air couriers. These disruptions left some DIs unable to execute payments to other DIs through the Fed's Fedwire system (see Chapter 4), which in turn resulted in an unexpected shortfall of funds for other DIs. The Federal Reserve took several steps to address the problems in the payments system on and after September 11, 2001. Around noon on the eleventh, the Board of Governors of the Fed released a statement saying that the Fed was open and operating and that the discount window was available to meet liquidity needs of all FIs. The Fed staff also contacted FIs frequently during the next few days, encouraging them to make payments and to consider the use of the discount window to cover unexpected shortfalls that they might encounter. Thus, the Fed's discount window was a primary tool used to restore payments coordination during this period.

The Fed took additional unprecedented steps, expanding the usual function of the discount window, to address the financial crisis. While the discount window had traditionally been available to DIs, in the spring of 2008 (as Bear Stearns nearly failed) investment banks gained access to the discount window through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). In the first three days, securities firms borrowed an average of 31.3 billion per day from the Fed. The largest expansion of the discount window's availability to all FIs occurred in the wake of the Lehman Brothers failure, as a series of actions were taken in response to the increasingly fragile state of financial markets. After March 2008, several new broad-based lending programs were implemented, providing funding to a wide array of new parties, including U.S. money market mutual funds, commercial paper issuers,

insurance companies, and others. These programs rapidly expanded the current lending programs offered via the Fed.

Further, over the next 18 months, in response to a weakening economy and a growing financial crisis, the Fed significantly reduced the level of short-term interest rates by lowering its target federal funds rate to near zero. The overall reduction in the target federal funds rate since late 2007 has been dramatic, going from 5.26 percent in September 2007 to a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008 (see Figure 22-1). It also significantly reduced the spread (premium) between the discount rate and the federal funds target to just a quarter of a point, bringing the discount rate down to a half percent. With lower rates at the Fed's discount window and interbank liquidity scarce as many lenders cut back their lending, more financial institutions chose to borrow at the window. The magnitude and diversity of nontraditional lending programs and initiatives developed during the crisis were unprecedented in Federal Reserve history. The lending programs were all designed to "unfreeze" and stabilize various parts of the credit markets, with the overall goal that parties receiving credit via these new Fed programs would, in turn, provide funding to creditworthy individuals and firms.

After holding its benchmark federal funds rate to near zero between 2008 and 2015, the Fed started a series of small increases in December 2015 and maintained consistent but gradual increases until December 2018. Then, starting in August 2019, the Fed started lowering rates in an attempt to keep the economic expansion from slowing due to signs that a slowdown is well under way.

# LIQUIDITY RISK AND INSURANCE COMPANIES

# LG 22-6 Life Insurance Companies

Like depository institutions, life insurance companies hold cash reserves and other liquid assets in order to meet policy payments and cancellations (surrenders) and other working capital needs that arise in the course of writing insurance. Least predictable among these

# surrender value

The amount that an insurance policyholder receives when cashing in a policy early.

is the early cancellation of an insurance policy which results in the insurer having to pay the insured the surrender value of that policy. In the normal course of business, premium income and returns on an insurer's asset portfolio are sufficient to meet the cash outflows required when policyholders surrender their policies early (see Chapter 15). When premium income is insufficient to meet surrenders, however, a life insurer can sell some of its relatively liquid assets, such as government bonds. In this case, bonds act as a buffer or reserve asset source of liquidity for the insurer. Nevertheless, a drop in market values of insurers' financial assets, such as the drop in the market values of many securities in 2001 and 2008, can result in investment losses for insurance companies and raise the possibility of increased insurance company failures.

Concerns about the solvency of an insurer can result in a run in which new premium income dries up and existing policyholders as a group seek to cancel their policies by cashing them in early. To meet exceptional demands for cash, a life insurer could be forced to liquidate other assets in its portfolio, such as commercial mortgage loans and other securities, potentially at fire-sale prices.[9] Forced asset liquidations can push an insurer, like a DI, into insolvency.

The most severe liquidity stress scenario faced by life insurers is a mass surrender of policies that arise due to a loss in the confidence of the financial strength of a firm. This was experienced by one of the largest life insurance companies in the U.K., Equitable Life, when it received an adverse legal ruling by the House of Lords on its guaranteed annuity liabilities in 2001. Due to this, surrenders rose sharply. In 2001, its net claims arising from surrenders and maturity rose to £6.2 billion from £3.0 billion in 2000. Unable to pay the £1.5 billion cost of losing the court case, it was forced to put itself up for sale. In December 2000, having failed to find a buyer, the insurer closed to new business and began selling its operations to generate cash to pay policyholders. After an 18-year-long winding-down process, Equitable Life's 256-year history finally ended in June 2018, when it has agreed to a £1.8 billion takeover by the insurance company Life Company Consolidation Group (LCCG).

# Property-Casualty Insurance Companies

As discussed in Chapter 15, property-casualty (P&C) insurers sell policies that insure against certain contingencies impacting either real property or individuals. These contingencies are relatively short term and unpredictable, unlike those covered by life insurers. With the help of mortality tables, claims on life insurance policies are generally predictable. P&C claims (such as the estimated 35 billion in insurance losses associated with Hurricane Sandy in 2012) are virtually impossible to predict. Thus, P&C insurers have a greater need for liquidity than life insurers. As a result, P&C insurers tend to hold shorter-term, more liquid assets than do life insurers. P&C insurers' contracts and premium-setting intervals are usually relatively short term as well, so that problems caused by policy surrenders are less severe. P&C insurers' greatest liquidity exposure occurs when policyholders cancel or fail to renew policies with an insurer because of pricing, competition, or safety and solvency concerns. This may cause an insurer's premium cash inflow, when added to its investment returns, to be insufficient to meet its policyholders' claims.

Alternatively, large unexpected claims may materialize and exceed the flow of premium income and income returns from assets. Disasters such as Hurricane Andrew in 1991 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have caused severe liquidity crises and failures among smaller P&C insurers.[10] A more recent example is the near failure of insurance giant AIG, which in late summer 2008 was hit by 18 billion in losses from guarantees (credit default

Swaps, or CDSs) it wrote on mortgage derivatives. As the mortgage debt securities' values declined, AIG was forced to post more collateral to signal to CDS contract counterparties that it could pay off the mortgage guarantees it wrote. Despite these actions by AIG, Standard & Poor's announced that it would downgrade AIG's credit rating. The rating downgrade required AIG to post up to an additional  \$14.5 billion in collateral, funds which it did not have. AIG made an unprecedented approach to the Federal Reserve seeking\$ 40 billion in short-term financing. The company announced that a financing entity—funded by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and AIG—had purchased \$46.1 billion of the complex debt securities insured by AIG. The deal also included a broader restructuring of the federal government's bailout of AIG, which originally included an \$85 billion bridge loan and 37.8 billion in Fed financing.

# Guarantee Programs for Life and

# Property-Casualty Insurance Companies

Both life insurance and property-casualty insurance companies are regulated at the state level (see Chapter 15). Unlike banks and thrifts, neither life nor P&C insurers have a federal guarantee fund. Beginning in the 1960s, most states began to sponsor state guarantee funds for firms selling insurance in that state. As discussed in Chapter 15, these state guarantee funds differ in a number of important ways from deposit insurance. First, although these programs are sponsored by state insurance regulators, they are actually run and administered by the private insurance companies themselves. Second, unlike the Depository Institution Insurance Fund, in which the FDIC established a permanent fund by requiring DIs to pay annual premiums to the fund in excess of insurance fund payouts to resolve failures, no permanent guarantee fund exists for the insurance industry, with the sole exception of the P&C and life guarantee funds for the state of New York. This means that contributions are paid into the guarantee fund by surviving firms only after an insurance company has failed.

Third, the size of the required contributions that surviving insurers make to protect policyholders in failed insurance companies differs widely from state to state. In those states that have no permanent guarantee fund, each surviving insurer is normally levied a pro rata amount, according to the size of its statewide premium income. This amount either helps pay off small policyholders after the assets of the failed insurer have been liquidated or acts as a cash injection to make the acquisition of a failed insurer attractive. The definition of small policyholders generally varies across states from  $100,000 to$ 500,000.

Finally, because no permanent fund exists and the annual pro rata contributions are often legally capped, a delay usually occurs before small policyholders receive the cash surrender values of their policies or other payment obligations from the guarantee fund. This contrasts with deposit insurance, where insured depositors normally receive immediate coverage (payout) of their claims.

Thus, the private nature of insurance industry guarantee funds, their lack of permanent reserves, and low caps on annual contributions mean that they provide less credible protection to claimants than do bank and thrift insurance funds. As a result, the incentives for insurance policyholders to engage in a run, should they perceive that an insurer has asset quality problems or insurance underwriting problems, is quite strong even in the presence of such guarantee funds.

# LIQUIDITY RISK AND INVESTMENT FUNDS

LG 22-7

Investment funds such as mutual funds and hedge funds sell shares as liabilities to investors and invest the proceeds in assets such as bonds and equities. Open-end investment funds must stand ready to buy back issued shares from investors at their current market price or net asset value (see Chapter 17). Thus, at a given market price, the supply of open-end fund shares is perfectly elastic. The price at which an open-end investment fund stands ready to sell new shares or redeem existing shares is the net asset value (NAV).

As discussed in Chapter 17, the NAV is the current or market value of the fund's assets less any accrued liabilities divided by the number of shares in the fund.

An investment fund's willingness to provide instant liquidity to shareholders while it invests funds in equities, bonds, and other long-term instruments could expose it to liquidity problems similar to those faced by depository institutions when the number of withdrawals (or in this case, mutual fund shares redeemed) rises to abnormally high or unexpected levels. Indeed, investment funds can be subject to dramatic liquidity needs if investors become nervous about the true value of a fund's assets. If the market value of the underlying assets falls and is expected to continue to fall, fund holders will want to liquidate their positions as fast as possible. However, the fundamental difference in the way that investment fund contracts are valued compared to the valuation of DI deposit contracts reduces the incentives for investment fund shareholders to engage in depositlike runs. Specifically, if an investment fund were to be closed and liquidated, its assets would be distributed to fund shareholders on an equal or pro rata basis rather than on the first-come, first-served basis employed under deposit and insurance policy contracts.

To illustrate this difference, we can compare the incentives for investment fund investors to engage in a run with those of DI depositors. Table 22-13 shows a simple balance sheet of an open-end investment fund and a DI. When they perceive that a DI's assets are valued below its liabilities, depositors have an incentive to engage in a run on the DI to be first in line to withdraw. In the example in Table 22-13, only the first 90 DI depositors receive  \$1 back for each\$ 1 deposited. The last 10 receive nothing at all.

Now consider the investment fund with 100 shareholders who invested  \$1 each for a total of\$ 100 with assets worth \$90. If these shareholders tried to cash in their shares, none would receive \$1. Instead, an investment fund values its balance sheet liabilities on a market value basis. The price of any share liquidated by an investor,  $P$ , is:

$$

P = \frac{\text{Va lu eo fa ss et s}}{\text{Sh ar es ou ts ta nd in g}} = \text{NA V}

$$

Thus, unlike deposit contracts that have fixed face values of 1, the value of an investment fund's shares reflects the changing value of its assets divided by the number of shares outstanding.

In Table 22-13, the value of each shareholder's claim is:

$$

P = \frac{\mathbb {S} 9 0}{1 0 0} = \mathbb {S} 0. 9 0

$$

That is, each investment fund shareholder participates in the fund's loss of asset value on a pro rata, or proportional, basis. Technically, whether first or last in line, each investment fund shareholder who cashes in shares on any given day receives the same net asset value per share of the fund. In this case, it is 90 cents, representing a loss of 10 cents per share for all shareholders. All investment fund shareholders realize this and know that investors share asset losses on a pro rata basis. As a result, being first in line to withdraw investment fund shares, on any given day, has no overall advantage. Of course, rapidly falling asset values will result in a greater incentive for investors to cash in their shares as quickly as possible before values fall any further. However, this rush, or run, by investors is due to a drop in the underlying value of their investments and not the threat of receiving nothing because they are not first in line to cash in.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

11. What the impact would be on a DI's liquidity needs if it offered deposit contracts of an open-end investment fund type rather than the traditional all-or-nothing demand deposit contract?
12. How the incentives of an investment fund's investors to engage in runs compare with the incentives of DI depositors?

This is not to say that mutual funds bear no liquidity risk. Money market mutual funds (MMMFs) experienced tremendous liquidity risk at the start of the financial crisis. On September 16, 2008 (one day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy), Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest money market fund in the United States, saw its shares fall to 97 cents (below the  \$1.00 book value) after writing off debt issued by Lehman Brothers. Resulting investor anxiety about Reserve Primary Fund spread to other funds, and investors industrywide liquidated their MMMF shares. In just one week investors liquidated\$ 170 billion of the industry's total \$14 trillion invested in MMMFs. In response, on September 19, the federal government took steps to restore confidence in the MMMF industry. Specifically, the Department of Treasury opened the Temporary Guarantee Program for MMMFs, which provided up to \$50 billion in coverage to MMMF shareholders for amounts they held in the funds as of close of business that day. Further, in July 2014, the SEC adopted new rules to address risks of investor runs in money market mutual funds. The new rules require a floating NAV for institutional prime money market funds. This change allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market value of fund assets. Using NAV will reduce the risk of runs in money market funds and provide important new tools that will help further protect investors and the financial system.

In October 2016, the SEC made a final rule that required mutual funds to implement and document a program to manage liquidity risk, including monthly disclosures on the relative liquidity of their assets, beginning December 1, 2018. The new rules are a significant part of the SEC's efforts to overhaul the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rules are also aimed at avoiding a repeat of the kind of problems that surfaced with the collapse of the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund in December 2015. Third Avenue was launched in 2009 and followed a strategy of buying debts in America's most financially leveraged companies (i.e., junk bonds). While the strategy worked at first, it backfired, and the fund posted a nearly 30 percent loss in 2015 prior to its closure.

The SEC's final rule on data and reporting introduces Form N-PORT, a monthly report with six sections and more than 300 data reporting elements that replaces quarterly form N-Q. Form N-PORT supervisory data will be made public on a lagging quarterly basis. The rule requires that each open-ended fund implement formal liquidity risk management program (the rule excludes closed-ended funds and most unit investment trusts). The rule does four things: (1) It clarifies the 15 percent limit on illiquid investments and introduces a new definition of liquidity risk focused on meeting redemption requests, (2) it imposes a requirement for each fund to apply a liquidity classification to portfolio holdings, (3) it calls for maintaining a liquidity minimum, and (4) it requires board oversight and also outlines an option for funds to use swing pricing as a tool to shield against excessive trading costs. The SEC clarified that ETFs that disclose daily portfolio information and already redeem "in kind" (meaning they provide securities rather than cash as redemptions) still must have a formal liquidity risk program. However, they are exempt from classifying the liquidity of investments and holding a liquidity minimum because ETF trading liquidity is supported by authorized participants through the unit-creation processes rather than by ETF unit holders.

Some of the biggest liquidity crises experienced by individual FIs recently have occurred with hedge funds, which are highly specialized investment funds with a limited number of wealthy investors, usually 100 or less. For example, in the summer of 2007, two Bear Stearns hedge funds suffered heavy losses on investments in the subprime mortgage market. The two funds filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 2007. Bear Stearns's market value was hurt badly from these losses. The losses became so great that by March 2008 Bear Stearns was struggling to finance its day-to-day operations. Bear Stearns had no choice but to basically sell itself to the highest bidder to avoid declaring bankruptcy or completely closing down and leaving investors totally empty-handed. JPMorgan Chase purchased the company for  \$236 million. Bear Stearns's skyscraper in New York was worth over\$ 2 billion alone.

# SUMMARY

This chapter provided an in-depth look at the measurement and on-balance-sheet management of liquidity risks. Liquidity risk is a common problem that DI managers face. Well-developed policies for holding liquid assets or having access to markets for purchased funds are normally adequate to meet liability withdrawals. Very large unexpected withdrawals, however, can cause asset liquidity problems to be compounded by incentives for liability claimholders to engage in runs at the first sign of a liquidity problem. The incentives for depositors and life insurance policyholders to engage in runs can push normally sound FIs into insolvency.

# PROBLEMS

1. The AllStar Bank has the following balance sheet:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets (in millions)</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$ 30</td><td>Deposits</td><td>\$ 90</td></tr><tr><td>Other assets</td><td>140</td><td>Borrowed funds</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>\$170</td><td>Other liabilities</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>\$170</td></tr></table>

Its largest customer decides to exercise a 15 million loan commitment. Show how the new balance sheet changes if AllStar uses (a) stored liquidity management or (b) purchased liquidity management. (LG 22-2)

2. Consider the balance sheet for the DI listed below:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets (in millions)</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>$10</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$68</td></tr><tr><td>Securities</td><td>15</td><td>Equity</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>50</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The DI is expecting a 15 million net deposit drain. Show the DI's balance sheet under these two conditions: (LG 22-2) a. The DI purchases liabilities to offset this expected drain.

b. The stored liquidity management is used to meet the liquidity shortfall.

3. A DI has assets of \$10 million consisting of \$1 million in cash and \$9 million in loans. It has core deposits of \$6 million. It also has \$2 million in subordinated debt and \$2 million in equity. Increases in interest rates are expected to result in a net drain of 1 million in core deposits over the year. (LG 22-2) a. The average cost of deposits is 2 percent and the average yield on loans is 5 percent. The DI decides to reduce its loan portfolio to offset this expected decline in deposits. What is the cost and what will be the total asset size of the firm from this strategy after the drain?

b. If the cost of issuing new short-term debt is 3.5 percent, what is the cost of offsetting the expected drain if the DI increases its liabilities? What will be the total asset size of the DI from this strategy after the drain?

4. The Plainbank has \$10 million in cash and equivalents, \$30 million in loans, and 15 million in core deposits. Calculate (a) the financing gap and (b) the financing requirement. (LG 22-3)
5. A DI has \$10 million in T-bills, a \$5 million line of credit to borrow in the repo market, and \$5 million in excess cash reserves (above reserve requirements) with the Fed. The DI currently has borrowed \$6 million in fed funds and 2 million from the Fed discount window to meet seasonal demands. (LG 22-3) a. What is the DI's total available (sources of) liquidity?

b. What is the DI's current total uses of liquidity?
c. What is the net liquidity of the DI?
d. What conclusions can you derive from the result?

6. The Acme Corporation has been acquired by the Conglomerate Corporation. To help finance the takeover, Conglomerate is going to liquidate the overfunded portion of Acme's pension fund. The assets listed below are going to be liquidated. Listed are their face values, liquidation values today, and their anticipated liquidation values one year from now (their fair market values). (LG 22-3)

<table><tr><td>Asset</td><td>Face Value</td><td>Current Liquidation Value</td><td>One-Year Liquidation Value</td></tr><tr><td>IBM stock</td><td>$10,000</td><td>$9,900</td><td>10,500</td></tr><tr><td>GE bonds</td><td>5,000</td><td>4,000</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury securities</td><td>15,000</td><td>13,000</td><td>14,000</td></tr></table>

Calculate the one-year liquidity index for these securities.

7. A DI has the following assets in its portfolio: \$20 million in cash reserves with the Fed, \$20 million in T-bills, and 50 million in mortgage loans. If it needs to dispose of its assets at short notice, it will receive only 99 percent of the fair market value of the T-bills and 90 percent of the fair market value of its mortgage loans. If the DI waits one month to liquidate these assets, it would receive the full fair market value for each security. Calculate the one-month liquidity index using the previous information. (LG 22-3)

8. An investment fund has the following assets in its portfolio: \$40 million in fixed-income securities and \$40 million in stocks at current market values. In the event of a liquidity crisis, it can sell its assets at a 96 percent discount if they are disposed of in two days. It will receive 98 percent if disposed of in four days. Two shareholders, A and B, own 5 percent and 7 percent of equity (shares), respectively. (LG 22-7) a. Market uncertainty has caused shareholders to sell their shares back to the investment fund. What will the two shareholders receive if the investment fund must sell all its assets in two days? In four days?

b. How does this differ from a bank run? How have bank regulators mitigated the problem of bank runs?

9. An investment fund has \$1 million in cash and \$9 million invested in securities. It currently has 1 million shares outstanding. (LG 22-7) a. What is the NAV of this fund?

b. Assume that some of the shareholders decide to cash in their shares of the fund. How many shares, at its current NAV, can the fund take back without resorting to a sale of assets?
 c. As a result of anticipated heavy withdrawals, it sells 10,000 shares of IBM stock currently valued at \$40. Unfortunately, it receives only \$35 per share. What is the net asset value after the sale? What are the fund's cash assets after the sale?
d. Assume after the sale of IBM shares, 100,000 shares are sold back to the fund. What is the current NAV? Is there a need to sell more stocks to meet this redemption?
