# INTEREST RATE AND INSOLVENCY RISK MANAGEMENT: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

In this third chapter on managing risk on an FI's balance sheet, we provide a detailed analysis of interest rate risk and insolvency risk. Chapter 20 established the fact that while performing their asset-transformation functions, financial institutions (FIs) often mismatch the maturities of their assets and liabilities. In so doing, they expose themselves to interest rate risk. This chapter analyzes two methods used to measure an FI's interest rate risk exposure: the repricing model and the duration model. The repricing gap model examines the impact of interest rate changes on an FI's net interest income (NII). However, as we explain later in the chapter, the FI's duration gap is a more comprehensive measure of interest rate risk exposure than the repricing gap. We also discuss in this chapter the on-balance-sheet management of interest rate risk.

Insolvency risk is the result, a consequence, or an outcome of excessive amounts of one or more of the risks taken by an FI (e.g., liquidity risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk). Technically, insolvency occurs when the internal capital or equity resources of an FI's owners are at or near zero as a result of bad balance sheet outcomes due to one or more of these risks. Indeed, insolvency risk experienced by depository institutions (DIs) during the financial market crisis hit the banking industry very badly. Over the period 2008-2016, 520 DIs failed (at a cost to the FDIC of 73 billion).

# INTEREST RATE RISK MEASUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT

While many factors influence the level and movement of interest rates, it is the central bank's monetary policy strategy that most directly underlies the level and movement of interest rates, which in turn affect an FI's cost of funds and return on assets. As discussed in Chapter 4, when the Fed finds it necessary to slow down the economy, it tightens monetary policy by taking actions that raise interest rates. The normal result is a decrease in business and household spending (especially that financed by credit or borrowing). Conversely, if business and household spending declines to the extent that the Fed finds it necessary to stimulate the economy, it allows interest rates to fall (an expansionary monetary policy). The drop promotes borrowing and spending. While these actions by the Fed to increase or decrease interest rates hamper or promote borrowing and spending, they also create interest rate risk for financial institutions. For example, in 2008, as the U.S. economy fell into its deepest recession since the Great Depression, the Fed, in a historic move, unexpectedly announced that it would drop its target fed funds rate to a range between zero and a quarter of 1 percent and lower its discount window rate to a half a percent, the lowest level since the 1940s. Even into 2015, because of the economy's continued weakness, the Fed announced that it expected to keep the fed funds rate below 1 percent. In essence, as long as rates stay low and the Fed makes statements that it does not intend to raise rates, interest rate risk is low. Rather, the critical concern for interest rate risk management is: when will the Fed increase interest rates? It was December 2015 before the Fed eventually raised interest rates (for the first time in 10 years). Even beyond the low rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and several smaller European central banks ventured into the once uncharted territory of negative interest rates. When central banks set negative interest rates, the lender pays the borrower—that is, instead of getting paid for depositing funds with the central bank, the commercial bank now pays the central bank to deposit funds.

In this section, we analyze two methods used to measure an FI's interest rate risk: the repricing gap and the duration gap model. The repricing gap model, sometimes called the funding gap model, concentrates on the impact of interest rate changes on an FI's net interest income (NII), which is the difference between an FI's interest income and interest expense (see Chapter 12). This contrasts with the market value-based duration gap model, which incorporates the impact of interest rate changes on the overall market value of an FI's balance sheet and ultimately on its owners' equity or net worth. Until recently, U.S. bank regulators had been content to base their evaluations of bank interest rate risk exposures on the repricing gap model alone. As discussed later in this chapter, regulators and other analysts now recognize the serious weaknesses of the repricing gap model. As a result, while the repricing gap model is still used to measure interest rate risk in most FIs, it is increasingly being used in conjunction with the duration gap model. In fact, the largest banks are now using the duration gap model as their main measure of interest rate risk.

# LG 23-1

# repricing or funding gap

The difference between those assets whose interest rates will be repriced or changed over some future period (RSAs) and liabilities whose interest rates will be repriced or changed over some future period (RSLs).

# Repricing Gap Model

The repricing or funding gap model is a simple model used by small (and thus most) FIs in the United States. This model is essentially a book value accounting cash flow analysis of the interest income earned on an FI's assets and the interest expense paid on its liabilities (or its net interest income) over some particular period. Under the repricing gap approach, DIs report quarterly on their Call Reports, interest-rate sensitivity reports that show the repricing gaps for assets and liabilities with various maturities; for example:

1. One day
2. More than 1 day to 3 months
3. More than 3 months to 6 months
4. More than 6 months to 12 months
5. More than 1 year to 5 years
6. More than 5 years

# rate sensitivity

The time to repricing of an asset or liability.

# refinancing risk

The risk that the cost of rolling over or reborrowing funds will rise above the returns being earned on asset investments.

# reinvestment risk

The risk that the returns on funds to be reinvested will fall below the cost of the funds.

The gap in each maturity bucket (or bin) is calculated by estimating the difference between the rate-sensitive assets (RSAs) and rate-sensitive liabilities (RSLs) on the balance sheet. Rate sensitivity means that the asset or liability is repriced (either because it matures and the funds will be rolled over into a new asset or liability, or because it is a financial instrument with a variable interest rate) at or near current market interest rates within the maturity horizon of the bucket under consideration. Repricing can be the result of a rollover of an asset or liability (e.g., a loan is paid off at or prior to maturity and the funds are used to issue a new loan at current market rates), or it can occur because the asset or liability is a variable-rate instrument (e.g., a variable-rate mortgage whose interest rate is reset every quarter based on movements in a prime rate). Table 23-1 shows the assets and liabilities of an FI categorized into each of the six previously defined maturity buckets. For simplicity, we assume equity is equal to zero.

The repricing model measures the change in an FI's net interest income exposure (or profit exposure) to interest rate changes in each different maturity bucket. For example, suppose that an FI has a negative  $10 million difference between assets and liabilities being repriced in one day (or the one-day bucket). Assets and liabilities that are repriced each day are likely to be interbank borrowings on the federal funds or repurchase agreement markets (see Chapter 5). Thus, a negative gap (\mathrm{RSA} < \mathrm{RSL})$  exposes the FI to refinancing risk, in that a rise in these short-term rates would lower the FI's net interest income since the FI has more rate-sensitive liabilities than assets in that bucket. Refinancing risk is a type of interest rate risk in that the cost of refinancing can be more than the return earned on asset investments. In other words, assuming equal changes in interest rates on RSAs and RSLs, interest expense will increase by more than interest revenue. Conversely, if the FI has a positive 20 million difference between its assets and liabilities being repriced in 6 months to 12 months, it has a positive gap ( $\mathrm{RSA} > \mathrm{RSL}$ ) for this period and is exposed to reinvestment risk. By holding shorter-term assets relative to liabilities, it faces uncertainty about the interest rate at which it can reinvest funds borrowed over a longer period. Thus, a drop in rates over this period would lower the FI's net interest income, since interest income would decrease by more than interest expense. Specifically, let:

$$
\Delta N I I _ {i} = \text {C h a n g e i n n e t i n t e r e s i g m a i n c o m e i n t h e i t h m a t u r y b u c k e t}
$$

$$
G A P _ {i} = \text {D o l l a r s i z e o f t h e g a p b e t w e e n t h e b o o k v a l u e o f r a t e - s e n s i t i v e a s s e t s}
$$

$$
\Delta R _ {i} = \text {C h a n g e i n t h e l e v e l o f i n t e r s t r a t e s i m p a c t i n g a s s e t s a n d l i b a l i t i e n t s i n t h e}
$$

Then:

$$
\Delta N I I _ {i} = \left(G A P _ {i}\right) \Delta R _ {i} = \left(R S A _ {i} - R S L _ {i}\right) \Delta R _ {i}
$$

In this first bucket, if the gap is negative 10 million and short-term interest rates (such as the fed funds and/or repo rates) rise by 1 percent, the annualized change in the FI's future net interest income is:

$$
\Delta N I I _ {i} = (- \$ 1 0 \text {m i l l o n}) \times 0. 0 1 = - \$ 1 0 0, 0 0 0
$$

That is, the negative gap and associated refinancing risk result in a loss of 100,000 in net interest income for the FI.

This approach is very simple and intuitive. We will see later in this section, however, that market or present-value losses (and gains) also occur on assets and liabilities when interest rates change. These effects are not accounted for in the funding gap model because asset and liability values are reported at their historic book values rather than on a market value basis. Thus, in the repricing gap model, interest rate changes affect only the current interest income earned and interest expense paid on an asset or liability, rather than the market value of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.[2]

The FI manager can also estimate cumulative gaps (CGAP) over various repricing categories or buckets. A common cumulative gap of interest is the one-year repricing gap estimated from Table 23-1 as:

$$
\mathrm {C G A P} = (- \mathrm {\# 1 0 m}) + (- \mathrm {\# 1 0 m}) + (- 1 5 \mathrm {m}) + \mathrm {\# 2 0 m} = - 1 5 \text {m i l l i o n}
$$

If  $\Delta R_{i}$  is the average interest rate change affecting assets and liabilities that can be repriced within a year, the cumulative effect on the bank's net interest income is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta N I I = \left(\sum_ {i = 1 \text {d a y}} ^ {1 \text {y e a r}} R S A _ {i} - \sum_ {i = 1 \text {d a y}} ^ {1 \text {y e a r}} R S L _ {i}\right) \Delta R _ {i} \\ = (C G A P) \Delta R _ {i} \\ = (- \$ 15 \text {m i l l o n}) (0. 0 1) = - \$ 1 5 0, 0 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

We next look at an example of calculating the cumulative one-year gap using an FI in the form of a commercial bank. Remember that the manager considers whether each asset or liability will, or can, have its interest rate changed within the next year. If it will or can, it is a rate-sensitive asset or liability. If not, it is a rate-insensitive asset or liability.

Measuring and Managing Interest Rate Risk Using the Repricing Gap. Consider the simplified bank balance sheet in Table 23-2. Rather than the original maturities, the reported maturities are those remaining on different assets and liabilities at the time the repricing gap is estimated.

Rate-Sensitive Assets. Looking down the asset side of the balance sheet in Table 23-2, we see the following one-year rate-sensitive assets (RSAs):

1. Short-term consumer loans: 50 million, which are repriced at the end of the year and just make the one-year cutoff.
2. Three-month T-bills: 30 million, which are repriced on maturity ( rollover) every three months.

(one-year maturity)</td><td>50</td><td>2. Demand deposits</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>3. Long-term consumer loans
(two-year maturity)</td><td>25</td><td>3. Passbook savings</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>4. Three-month T-bills</td><td>30</td><td>4. Three-month CDs</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>5.

One-year time deposits</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>8. 30-year floating-rate mortgages</td><td>40</td><td>8. Equity capital (fixed)</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>9. Premises</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$270</td><td></td><td>$270</td></tr></table>

2. For example, a 30-year bond purchased 10 years ago when rates were 13 percent would be reported as having the same book (accounting) value as when rates were 7 percent. Using market values, capital gains and losses would be reflected on the balance sheet as rates change.
3. Six-month T-notes: 35 million, which are repriced on maturity ( rollover) every six months.
4. 30-year floating-rate mortgages: 40 million, which are repriced (i.e., the mortgage rate is reset) every nine months. Thus, these long-term assets are RSAs in the context of the repricing model with a one-year repricing horizon.

Summing these four items produces total one-year RSAs of  $155 million. The remaining$ 115 million of assets are not rate sensitive over the one-year repricing horizon—that is, a change in the level of interest rates will not affect the size of the interest income generated by these assets over the next year. $^3$  The $5 million in the cash and due from category and the $5 million in premises are nonearning assets. Although the 105 million in long-term consumer loans, three-year Treasury bonds, and 10-year, fixed-rate mortgages generate interest income, the size of revenue generated will not change over the next year, since the interest rates or coupons earned on these assets are not expected to change (i.e., they are fixed over the next year).

Rate-Sensitive Liabilities. Looking down the liability side of the balance sheet in Table 23-2, we see that the following liability items clearly fit the one-year rate or repricing sensitivity test:

1. Three-month CDs: 40 million, which mature in three months and are repriced on rollover.
2. Three-month banker's acceptances: 20 million, which mature in three months and are repriced on rollover.
 3. Six-month commercial paper: 60 million, which matures and is repriced every six months.
 4. One-year time deposits: 20 million, which are repriced at the end of the one-year gap horizon.

Summing these four items produces one-year rate-sensitive liabilities (RSLs) of  $140 million. The remaining$ 130 million is not rate sensitive over the one-year period. The $20 million in equity capital and $40 million in demand deposits (see the following discussion) do not pay interest and are therefore classified as noninterest paying. The $30 million in passbook savings (see the following discussion) and $40 million in two-year time deposits generate interest expense over the next year, but the level of the interest expense generated will not change if the general level of interest rates change. Thus, we classify these items as rate-insensitive liabilities. We can make strong arguments for and against their inclusion as rate-sensitive liabilities.

Against Inclusion. Historically, demand deposits were prohibited from paying explicit interest. However, as of July 2011 the federal prohibition against the payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed. Despite this change, few depository institutions are paying any interest on demand deposits. Further, although explicit interest is paid on transaction accounts such as NOW accounts, the rates paid by FIs do not fluctuate directly with changes in the general level of interest rates (particularly when the general level of rates is rising). Moreover, many demand deposits act as core deposits for FIs, meaning they are a long-term source of funds. Thus, FIs do not include demand deposits as rate-sensitive liabilities.

# core deposits

Those deposits that act as a long-term source of funds for an FI.

For Inclusion. Even though they pay no explicit interest, demand deposits pay implicit interest because FIs do not charge fees to fully cover their costs for checking services. Further, if interest rates rise, individuals draw down (or run off) all, or more likely, a portion of their demand deposits, forcing the bank to replace them with higher-yielding, interest-bearing, rate-sensitive funds. This is most likely to occur when the interest rates on alternative instruments are high. In such an environment, the opportunity cost of holding funds in demand deposit accounts is likely to be larger than it is in a low-interest rate environment. In this case, FIs would include all or a portion of demand deposits as rate-sensitive liabilities.

Similar arguments for and against the inclusion of retail passbook savings accounts also can be made. Although Federal Reserve Regulation Q ceilings on the maximum rates to be charged for these accounts were abolished in March 1986, banks still adjust these rates only infrequently. However, savers tend to withdraw funds from these accounts when rates rise, forcing banks to replace them with more expensive fund substitutions.

The four repriced liabilities ( $40 +$ 20 + $60 + $20) sum to  $140 million, and the four repriced assets ($ 50 + $30 + $35 + $40) sum to $155 million. Given this, the cumulative one-year repricing gap (CGAP) for the bank is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {C G A P} = (\text {O n e - y e a r R S A}) - (\text {O n e - y e a r R S A}) \\ = \mathrm {R S A} - \mathrm {R S L} \\ = \$ 155 \text {m i l l i o n} - \$ 140 \text {m i l l i o n} = \$ 15 \text {m i l l i o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

Interest rate sensitivity can also be expressed as a percentage of assets (A), commonly referred to as the gap ratio:

$$
\mathrm{GAP ratio} = \frac{CGAP}{A} = \frac{\mathbb{S}15\text{million}}{\mathbb{S}270\text{million}} = 0.056 = 5.6\%
$$

Expressing the repricing gap in this way is useful since it tells us (1) the direction of the interest rate exposure (positive or negative CGAP) and (2) the scale of that exposure as indicated by dividing the gap by the asset size of the institution. In our example, the bank has a CGAP equal to 5.6 percent of the value of its total assets. This version of the gap ratio is used by regulators to measure interest rate risk.[5]

Table 23-3 shows an interest rate sensitivity report for Flushing Financial Corporation for 2019. In this report, Flushing Financial reports the repricing gap for periods ranging from 3 months or less to over 10 years.

Equal Changes in Rates on RSAs and RSLs. The CGAP provides a measure of an FI's interest rate sensitivity. Table 23-4 highlights the relation between CGAP and changes in NII when interest rate changes for RSAs are equal to interest rate changes for RSLs. For example, when CGAP is positive (or the FI has more RSAs than RSLs), NII will rise when interest rates rise (row 1, Table 23-4), since interest income increases more than interest expense does.

# EXAMPLE 23-1 Impact of Rate Changes on Net Interest Income When CGAP Is Positive

Suppose that, for the bank depicted in Table 23-2, interest rates rise by 1 percent on both RSAs and RSLs. The CGAP would project the expected annual change in net interest income  $(\Delta NII)$  of the bank as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta N I I = (R S A \times \Delta R) - (R S L \times \Delta R) = C G A P \times \Delta R \\ = (\$ 1 5 5 \text {m i l l i o n} \times 0. 0 1) - (\$ 1 4 0 \text {m i l l i o n} \times 0. 0 1) = (\$ 1 5 \text {m i l l i o n}) \times 0. 0 1 \\ = (\$ 1. 5 5 \text {m i l l i o n} - \$ 1. 4 0 \text {m i l l i o n}) = \$ 1 5 0, 0 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

Similarly, if interest rates fall equally for RSAs and RSLs (row 2, Table 23-4), NII will fall when CGAP is positive. As rates fall, interest income falls by more than interest expense. Thus, NII falls. Suppose that for our bank, rates fall by 1 percent. The CGAP predicts that NII will fall by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta N I I = [ \$ 1 5 5 \text {m i l l i o n} \times (- 0. 0 1) ] - [ \$ 1 4 0 \text {m i l l i o n} \times (- 0. 0 1) ] = \$ 1 5 \text {m i l l i o n} \times - 0. 0 1 \\ = - \$ 1. 5 5 \text {m i l l i o n} - (- \$ 1. 4 0 \text {m i l l i o n}) = - \$ 1 5 0, 0 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

# CGAP effect

The relation between changes in interest rates and changes in net interest income.

It is evident from this example that the larger the absolute value of CGAP, the larger the expected change in NII (i.e., the larger the increase or decrease in the FI's interest income relative to interest expense). In general, when CGAP is positive, the change in NII is positively related to the change in interest rates. Thus, an FI would want its CGAP to be positive when interest rates are expected to rise. Conversely, when CGAP is negative, if interest rates rise by equal amounts for RSAs and RSLs (row 3, Table 23-4), NII will fall (since the bank has more RSLs than RSAs). If interest rates fall equally for RSAs and RSLs (row 4, Table 23-4), NII will increase when CGAP is negative. As rates fall, interest expense decreases by more than interest income. In general then, when CGAP is negative, the change in NII is negatively related to the change in interest rates. Thus, an FI would want its CGAP to be negative when interest rates are expected to fall. We refer to these relationships as CGAP effects.

Unequal Changes in Rates on RSAs and RSLs. The previous section considered changes in net interest income as interest rates changed, assuming that the change in rates on RSAs was exactly equal to the change in rates on RSLs (in other words, assuming the interest rate spread between rates on RSAs and RSLs remained unchanged). This is not often the case. Rather, rate changes on RSAs generally differ from those on RSLs (i.e., the spread between interest rates on assets and liabilities changes along with the levels of these rates). See Panel a of Figure 23-1, which plots monthly CD rates (liabilities) and prime lending rates (assets) for the period 1990-2020. Panel b shows the monthly spread between the two rates. Notice that although the rates generally move in the same direction, they are not perfectly correlated. In this case, as we consider the impact of rate changes on NII, we have a spread effect in addition to the CGAP effect.

If the spread between the rate on RSAs and RSLs increases, when interest rates rise (fall), interest income increases (decreases) by more (less) than interest expense. The result is an increase in NII. Conversely, if the spread between the rates on RSAs and RSLs decreases, when interest rates rise (fall), interest income increases (decreases) less (more) than interest expense, and NII decreases. In general, the spread effect is such that, regardless of the direction of the change in interest rates, a positive relation exists between changes in the spread (between rates on RSAs and RSLs) and changes in NII. Whenever the spread increases (decreases), NII increases (decreases).

# spread effect

The effect that a change in the spread between rates on RSAs and RSLs has on net interest income (NII) as interest rates change.

# EXAMPLE 23-2 Impact of Spread Effect on Net Interest Income

To understand spread effect, assume for a moment that both RSAs and RSLs equal 155 million. Suppose that rates rise by 1.2 percent on RSAs and by 1 percent on RSLs (i.e., the spread between the rate on RSAs and RSLs increases by 1.2 percent - 1 percent = 0.2 percent). The resulting change in NII is calculated as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta N I I = \left(R S A \times \Delta R _ {R S A}\right) - \left(R S L \times \Delta R _ {R S L}\right) \\ = \Delta \text {I n t e r s t i n c o m e} - \Delta \text {I n t e r s t e x p e n s e} \\ = (\$ 155 \text {million} \times 1.2 \%) - (\$ 155 \text {million} \times 1.0 \%) \\ = \$ 155 \text{ million} (1.2\% - 1.0\%) \\ = \$ 3 1 0, 0 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

See Table 23-5 for various combinations of CGAP and spread changes and their effects on NII. The first four rows in Table 23-5 consider a bank with a positive CGAP; the last four rows consider a bank with a negative CGAP. Notice in Table 23-5 that the CGAP and spread effects can both have the same effect on NII. For example, in row 6 of Table 23-5, if CGAP is negative and interest rates increase, the CGAP effect says NII will decrease. If, at the same time, the spread between RSAs and RSLs decreases as interest rates increase, the spread effect also says NII will decrease. In these cases, FI managers can accurately predict the direction of the change in NII as interest rates change (rows indicated with one arrow under the Change in NII column). When the two work in opposite directions, however, the change in NII cannot be predicted without

# EXAMPLE 23-3 Combined Impact of CGAP and the Spread Effect on Net Interest Income

Suppose that for the FI in Table 23-2, interest rates fall by 1.0 percent on RSAs and by 1.2 percent on RSLs. Now the change in NII is calculated as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta N I I = [ \$ 1 5 5 \text {m i l l i o n} \times (- 0. 0 1 0) ] - [ \$ 1 4 0 \text {m i l l i o n} \times (- 0. 0 1 2) ] \\ = \$ 1.55 \text {m i l l i o n} - (- \$ 1.68 \text {m i l l i o n}) \\ = \$ 0.13 \text {m i l l o n , o r \$ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0} \\ \end{array}
$$

Even though the CGAP effect (i.e., \mathrm{RSA} > \mathrm{RSA}) is putting negative pressure on NII (in Example 23-1, the CGAP effect of a 1 percent decrease in the rate on both RSAs and RSLs produced a decrease in NII of 150,000), the increase in the spread, and the resulting spread effect, is so big that NII increases by 130,000.

Some FIs accept quite large interest rate exposures relative to their asset sizes. For example, the one-year repricing gap to total interest-earning assets ratio of Flushing Financial Corporation was 12.71 percent at the end of 2019 (i.e., it had more RSAs than RSLs). If interest rates rose in 2020, Flushing Financial Corporation was set up to see net interest income increases due to the repricing of its large amount of RSAs (relative to RSLs) at higher rates. Flushing Financial's management set up its balance sheet in expectation of interest rate increases over the next 10 years.

The repricing gap is the measure of interest rate risk historically used by FIs, and it is still the main measure of interest rate risk used by small community banks and thrifts. The repricing gap model is conceptually easy to understand and can easily be used to forecast changes in profitability for a given change in interest rates. The repricing gap can be used to allow an FI to structure its assets and liabilities or to go off the balance sheet to take advantage of a projected interest rate change. However, the repricing gap model has some major weaknesses that have resulted in regulators calling for the use of more comprehensive models (e.g., the duration gap model) to measure the interest rate risk of an FI. We next discuss some of the major weaknesses of the repricing model.

Weaknesses of the Repricing Model. Despite the fact that this model of interest rate risk is used by the vast majority of depository institutions in the United States, the repricing model has four major weaknesses: (1) it ignores market value effects of interest rate changes, (2) it ignores cash flow patterns within a maturity bucket, (3) it fails to deal with the problem of rate-insensitive asset and liability cash flow runoffs and prepayments, and (4) it ignores cash flows from off-balance-sheet activities. This section discusses each of these weaknesses.

Market Value Effects. As discussed in the next section, interest rate changes have a market (or present) value effect in addition to an income effect on asset and liability values. That is, the present values of the cash flows on assets and liabilities change, in addition to the immediate interest received or paid on them, as interest rates change. In fact, the present values (and, where relevant, the market prices) of virtually all assets and liabilities on an FI's balance sheet change as interest rates change. As such, the repricing gap is only a partial and short-term measure of an FI's true overall interest rate risk exposure.

Cash Flow Patterns within a Maturity Bucket. The problem of defining buckets over a range of maturities ignores information regarding the distribution of assets and liabilities within that bucket. For example, the dollar values of RSAs and RSLs within any maturity bucket range may be equal. However, on average, liabilities may be repriced toward the end of the bucket's range and assets may be repriced toward the beginning, in which case a change in interest rates will have an effect on asset and liability cash flows that will not be accurately measured by the repricing gap approach.

# runoff

Periodic cash flow of interest and principal amortization payments on long-term assets such as conventional mortgages that can be reinvested at market rates.

The Problem of Runoffs and Prepayments. Even if an asset or liability is rate insensitive, virtually all assets and liabilities pay some interest and/or principal back in any given year. As a result, the FI receives a cash flow or runoff from its rate-insensitive portfolio that can be reinvested at current market rates. That is, most assets and liabilities (e.g., long-term mortgages) pay some principal and/or interest back to the FI in any given year. This runoff cash flow component of a rate-insensitive asset and liability is itself rate sensitive. The FI manager can easily deal with this in the repricing gap model by identifying for each asset and liability item the estimated dollar cash flow that will be run off within the next year (or other time frame) and adding these amounts to the value of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities.

Similarly, the repricing model assumes that there is no prepayment of RSAs and RSLs. In reality, however, cash flows from RSAs and RSLs do not act in such a predictable fashion. For example, a mortgage may be paid off early, either to buy a new house or to refinance the mortgage should interest rates fall. For a variety of reasons, mortgage borrowers relocate or refinance their mortgages (especially when current mortgage rates are below mortgage coupon rates). This propensity to prepay means that realized cash flows on RSAs and RSLs can often deviate substantially from the stated or expected cash flows in a noprepayment world. As with runoffs, the FI manager can deal with prepayments in the repricing gap model by estimating the amount of prepayment on each asset and liability within the next year (or other time frame) and adding these amounts to the values of RSAs and RSLs.

Cash Flows from Off-Balance-Sheet Activities. The RSAs and RSLs used in the repricing model generally include only assets and liabilities listed on the balance sheet. Changes in interest rates will affect the cash flows on many off-balance-sheet instruments as well. For example, an FI might have hedged its interest rate risk with an interest rate futures contract (see Chapter 24). As interest rates change, these futures contracts—as part of the marking-to-market process—produce a daily cash flow (either positive or negative) for the FI that may offset any on-balance-sheet gap exposure. These offsetting cash flows from futures contracts are ignored by the simple repricing model and should (and could) be included in the model.

LG 23-3

# Duration Gap Model

In Chapter 3, we demonstrated how to calculate duration and showed that the duration measure has economic meaning as the sensitivity of an asset or liability's value to small changes in interest rates. That is:

$$
D = -\frac{\% \Delta \text {in the market value of a security}}{\Delta R / (1 + R)}
$$

# duration gap

A measure of overall interest rate risk exposure for an FI.

For FIs, the major relevance of duration is its use as a measure of interest rate risk exposure. The duration gap model can be used instead of the repricing model discussed earlier to evaluate an FI's overall interest rate exposure—to measure the FI's duration gap.

The Duration Gap for a Financial Institution. To estimate the overall duration gap of an FI, we first determine the duration of an FI's asset portfolio  $(A)$  and the duration of its liability portfolio  $(L)$ . Specifically, the duration of a portfolio of assets or liabilities is the market value weighted average of the durations of the components of the portfolio. These can be calculated as:

$$
D _ {A} = X _ {1 A} D _ {1} ^ {A} + X _ {2 A} D _ {2} ^ {A} + \dots + X _ {n A} D _ {n} ^ {A}
$$ and:


$$

D _ {L} = X _ {1 L} D _ {1} ^ {L} + X _ {2 L} D _ {2} ^ {L} + \dots + X _ {n L} D _ {n} ^ {L}

$$ where


$$

\begin{array}{l} X _ {1 j} + X _ {2 j} + \ldots + X _ {n j} = 1 \\ j = A, L \\ \end{array}

$$

The  $X_{ij}$ 's in the equation represent the market value proportions of each asset or liability held in the respective asset and liability portfolios. Thus, if new 30-year Treasury bonds were 1 percent of a life insurer's portfolio and  $D_1^A$ , the duration of those bonds, was equal to 9.25 years,  $X_{1A}D_1^A = 0.01(9.25) = 0.0925$ . More simply, the duration of a portfolio of assets or liabilities is a market value weighted average of the individual durations of the assets or liabilities on the FI's balance sheet.

Consider an FI's simplified market value balance sheet:

<table><tr><td>Assets ($)</td><td>Liabilities/Equity ($)</td></tr><tr><td>Assets (A) = $100</td><td>Liabilities (L) = $ 90</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Equity (E) = 10 / 100</td></tr></table>

From the balance sheet:

$$

A = L + E

$$ and:


$$

\Delta A = \Delta L + \Delta E

$$ or:


$$

\Delta E = \Delta A - \Delta L

$$

That is, when interest rates change, the change in the FI's equity or net worth  $(E)$  equals the difference between the change in the market values of assets and liabilities on each side of the balance sheet.

Since  $\Delta E = \Delta A - \Delta L$ , we need to determine how  $\Delta A$  and  $\Delta L$  —the changes in the market values of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet—are related to their duration.

From the duration model (assuming annual compounding of interest):

$$

\frac {\Delta A}{A} = - D _ {A} \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$ and:


$$

\frac {\Delta L}{L} = - D _ {L} \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$

6. In what follows, we use the  $\Delta$  (change) notation instead of  $d$  (derivative notation) to recognize that interest rate changes tend to be discrete rather than infinitesimally small. For example, in real-world financial markets the smallest observed rate change is usually one basis point, or 1/100 of 1 percent.

Here we have simply substituted  $\Delta A / A$  or  $\Delta L / L$ , the percentage change in the market values of assets or liabilities, for  $\Delta P / P$ , the percentage change in any single bond's price, and  $D_{A}$  or  $D_{L}$ , the duration of the FI's asset or liability portfolio, for  $D_{i}$ , the duration on any given bond, deposit, or loan. The term  $\Delta R / (1 + R)$  reflects the shock to interest rates as before. To show dollar changes, these equations can be rewritten as:

$$

\Delta A = A \times - D _ {A} \times \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$ and:


$$

\Delta L = L \times - D _ {L} \times \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$

Since  $\Delta E = \Delta A - \Delta L$ , we can substitute these two expressions into this equation. Rearranging and combining these equations results in a measure of the change in the market value of equity:

$$

\Delta E = - \left(D _ {A} - k D _ {L}\right) \times A \times \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$ where


$k = L / A =$  Measure of the FI's leverage—the amount of borrowed funds or liabilities rather than owners' equity used to fund its asset portfolio

The effect of interest rate changes on the market value of an FI's equity or net worth  $(\Delta E)$  breaks down into three effects:

1. The leverage-adjusted duration gap  $= D_{A} - kD_{L}$ . This gap is measured in years and reflects the degree of duration mismatch in an FI's balance sheet. Specifically, the larger this gap in absolute terms, the more exposed the FI is to interest rate risk.
2. The size of the FI. The term  $A$  measures the size of the FI's assets. The larger the asset size of the FI, the larger the dollar size of the potential net worth exposure from any given interest rate shock.
3. The size of the interest rate shock  $= \Delta R / (1 + R)$ . The larger the shock, the greater the FI's exposure.

7. For simplicity, we assume that the interest rate changes are the same for both assets and liabilities. This assumption is standard in Macauley duration analysis (see Chapter 3).

8.  $\Delta E = \left[A\times (-D_A)\times \frac{\Delta R}{(1 + R)}\right] - \left[L\times (-D_L)\times \frac{\Delta R}{(1 + R)}\right]$

Assuming that the level of interest rates and expected shock to interest rates are the same for both assets and liabilities:

$$

\Delta E = \left[ (- D _ {A}) A + (D _ {L}) L \right] \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$ or:


$$

\Delta E = - \left(D _ {A} A - D _ {L} L\right) \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)}

$$

To rearrange the equation in a slightly more intuitive fashion, we multiply and divide both the terms  $D_{A}A$  and  $D_{L}L$  by  $A$  (assets):

$$

\Delta E = - \left[ (A / A) D _ {A} - (L / A) D _ {L} \right] \times A \times [ \Delta R / (1 + R) ]

$$

Therefore:

$$

\Delta E = - \left[ D _ {A} - (L / A) D _ {L} \right] \times A \times \left[ \Delta R / (1 + R) \right]

$$ and thus:


$$

\Delta E = - \left(D _ {A} - k D _ {L}\right) \times A \times [ \Delta R / (1 + R) ]

$$ where


$$ k = L / A
$$

9. We assume that the level of rates and the expected shock to interest rates are the same for both assets and liabilities. This assumption is standard in Macauley duration analysis. Although restrictive, this assumption can be relaxed. Specifically, if  $\Delta R_{A}$  is the shock to assets and  $\Delta R_{L}$  is the shock to liabilities, we can express the duration gap model as:

$$
\Delta E = - \left[ \left(D _ {A} \times A \times \frac {\Delta R _ {A}}{1 + R _ {A}}\right) - \left(D _ {L} \times L \times \frac {\Delta R _ {L}}{1 + R _ {L}}\right) \right]
$$

Given this, we express the exposure of the net worth of the FI as:

$\Delta E = -$  Leverage adjusted duration gap  $\times$  Asset size  $\times$  Interest rate shock

Interest rate shocks are largely external to the FI and often result from changes in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy or from international capital movements (as discussed in Chapter 4). The size of the duration gap and the size of the FI, however, are largely under the control of its management. Table 23-6 shows the duration gap and the market value impact on Fannie Mae's net portfolio for interest rate shocks for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and the three months ended September 30, 2018. For both periods, the effective duration gap was approximately zero months.

We next use an example to explain how a manager can utilize information on an FI's duration gap to restructure the balance sheet to immunize stockholders' net worth against interest rate risk (i.e., set the balance sheet up before a change in interest rates, so that  $\Delta E$  is nonnegative for a forecasted change in interest rates). The general rules we illustrate are as follows. If the duration gap (DGAP) is negative, there is a positive relation between changes in interest rates and changes in the market value of the FI. Thus, if interest rates increase (decrease), the market value of the FI increases (decreases). If the DGAP is positive, there is a negative relation between changes in interest rates and changes in the market value of the FI. Thus, if interest rates decrease (increase), the market value of the FI increases (decreases). Table 23-7 highlights this relation between DGAP and changes in an FI's equity value.

# EXAMPLE 23-4 Duration Gap Measurement and Exposure

Suppose that the FI manager calculates that:

$$
D _ {A} = 5 \text {y e a r s}
$$

$$
D _ {L} = 3 \text {y e a r s}
$$

Then the manager learns from an economic forecasting unit that rates are expected to rise from 10 percent to 11 percent in the immediate future. That is:

$$
\Delta R = 1 \% = 0.01
$$

$$
1 + R = 1. 1 0
$$

The FI's initial balance sheet is:

<table><tr><td>Assets ($ millions)</td><td>Liabilities ($ millions)</td></tr><tr><td>A = $100</td><td>L = $ 90</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">E = 10</td></tr><tr><td>$100</td><td>$100</td></tr></table>

The FI manager calculates the potential loss to equity holders' net worth  $(E)$  if the forecast of rising rates proves true:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta E = - \left(D _ {A} - k D _ {L}\right) \times A \times \frac {\Delta R}{(1 + R)} \\ = - [ 5 - (0. 9) (3) ] \times \$ 1 0 0 \text {m i l l i o n} \times \frac {0 . 0 1}{1 . 1} = - \$ 2. 0 9 \text {m i l l i o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

The FI could lose  $2.09 million in net worth if rates rise by 1 percent. The FI started with$ 10 million in equity, so the loss of 2.09 million is almost 21 percent of its initial net worth. The market value balance sheet after the rise in rates by 1 percent then appears as follows:10

<table><tr><td>Assets ($ millions)</td><td>Liabilities ($ million)</td></tr><tr><td>A = $95.45</td><td>L = $87.54</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">$95.45</td><td>E = 7.91</td></tr><tr><td>$95.45</td></tr></table>

Even though the rise in interest rates would not push the FI into economic insolvency, it reduces the FI's net-worth-to-assets ratio from 10 percent (10/100) to 8.29 percent (7.91/95.45). To counter this effect, the manager might reduce the FI's duration gap. In an extreme case, this gap might be reduced to zero:

$$
\Delta E = (0) \times A \times \Delta R / (1 + R) = 0
$$

To do this, the FI should not directly set  $D_A = D_L$ , which ignores the fact that the FI's assets (A) do not equal its borrowed liabilities (L) and that  $k$  (which reflects the ratio  $L / A$ ) is not equal to 1. To see the importance of factoring in leverage (or  $L / A$ ), suppose that the manager increases the duration of the FI's liabilities to five years, the same as  $D_A$ . Then:

$$
\Delta E = - [ 5 - (0. 9) (5) ] \times \$ 1 0 0 \text {m i l l i o n} \times (0. 0 1 / 1. 1) = - 0. 4 5 \text {m i l l i o n}
$$

The FI is still exposed to a loss of 0.45 million if rates rise by 1 percent.

An appropriate strategy involves changing  $D_{L}$  until:

$$
D _ {A} = k D _ {L} = 5 \text {y e a r s}
$$

For example:

$$
\Delta E = - [ 5 - (0. 9) 5. 5 5 ] \times \$ 1 0 0 \text {m i l l i o n} \times (0. 0 1 / 1. 1) = 0
$$

In this case, the FI manager sets  $D_{L} = 5.55$  years, or slightly longer than  $D_{A} = 5$  years, to compensate for the fact that only 90 percent of assets are funded by borrowed liabilities, with the other 10 percent funded by equity. Note that the FI manager has at least three other ways to reduce the duration gap to zero:

1. Reduce  $D_A$ . Reduce  $D_A$  from 5 years to 2.7 years (equal to  $kD_L$ , or [0.9][3]) so that

$$
\left(D _ {A} - k D _ {L}\right) = [ 2. 7 - (0. 9) (3) ] = 0
$$

10. These values are calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac{\Delta A}{A} = -5\Bigg(\frac{0.01}{1.1}\Bigg) = -0.04545 = -4.545\% \\ 1 0 0 + (- 0. 0 4 5 4 5) 1 0 0 = 9 5. 4 5 \\ \end{array}
$$ and:


$$

\begin{array}{l} \frac {\Delta L}{L} = - 3 \left(\frac {0 . 0 1}{1 . 1}\right) = - 0. 0 2 7 2 7 = - 2. 7 2 7 \\ 9 0 + (- 0. 0 2 7 2 7) 9 0 = 8 7. 5 4 \\ \end{array}

$$

2. Reduce  $D_{A}$  and increase  $D_{L}$ . Shorten the duration of assets and lengthen the duration of liabilities at the same time. One possibility is to reduce  $D_{A}$  to 4 years and to increase  $D_{L}$  to 4.44 years so that

$$

\left(D _ {A} - k D _ {L}\right) = [ 4 - (0. 9) (4. 4 4) ] = 0

$$

3. Change  $k$  and  $D_{L}$ . Increase  $k$  (leverage) from 0.9 to 0.95 and increase  $D_{L}$  from 3 years to 5.26 years so that:

$$

\left(D _ {A} - k D _ {L}\right) = \left[ 5 - (0. 9 5) (5. 2 6) \right] = 0

$$

As mentioned earlier, an assumption of the duration gap model is that the change in interest rates is the same for both assets and liabilities. Without this assumption, the duration gap equation is invalid. Rather, if interest rate changes on assets and liabilities differ, the FI must evaluate the change in asset values and liability values separately. The change in equity is then the difference in these values.

# EXAMPLE 23-5 Unequal Interest Rate Changes on Assets and Liabilities

Suppose that in Example 23-4 the FI manager learns that rates are expected to rise from 10 to 11.5 percent in the immediate future on assets, and they are expected to rise from 10 to 11 percent on liabilities. Or,

$$

\Delta R _ {A} = 1 \% = 0.015 \quad \text {and} \quad 1 + R _ {A} = 1.10

$$

$$

\Delta R _ {L} = 1 \% = 0.010 \quad \text {and} \quad 1 + R _ {L} = 1.10

$$

The FI manager calculates the potential loss to equity holders' net worth  $(E)$  if the forecast of rising rates proves true by first finding the change in asset values and liability values given the change in interest rates on the individual portfolios.

$$

\Delta A = - D _ {A} \frac {d R _ {A}}{1 + R _ {A}} A = \Delta A = - 5 \times \frac {0 . 0 1 5}{1 . 1 0} \times \$ 1 0 0 \text {m i l l i o n} = - \$ 6. 8 2 \text {m i l l i o n}

$$ and


$$

\Delta L = - D _ {L} \frac {d R _ {L}}{1 + R _ {L}} L = \Delta L = - 4 \times \frac {0 . 0 1 0}{1 . 1 0} \times \$ 9 0 \text {m i l l i o n} = - \$ 3. 2 7 \text {m i l l i o n}

$$

Thus,

$$

\Delta E = \Delta A - \Delta L = - \$ 6.82 \text {m i l l i o n} - (- \$ 3.27 \text {m i l l i o n}) = - \$ 3.55 \text {m i l l i o n}

$$

The market value balance sheet after the unequal rise in rates in interest rates is:

<table><tr><td>Assets ($ millions)</td><td>Liabilities ($ millions)</td></tr><tr><td>A = 93.18</td><td>L = 86.73</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>E = 6.45</td></tr><tr><td>93.18</td><td>95.45</td></tr></table>

The preceding examples demonstrate how the duration model can be used to immunize an FI's entire balance sheet against interest rate risk (i.e., so that the value of the FI's equity is unaffected by changes in interest rates).

LG 23-2

Difficulties in Applying the Duration Model to Real-World FI Balance Sheets. Critics of the duration model have often claimed that it is difficult to apply in real-world situations. However, duration measures and immunization strategies are useful in most real-world situations. In fact, the model recently proposed by the Federal Reserve and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to monitor bank interest rate risk is heavily based on the duration model. We next consider the various criticisms of the duration model and discuss ways that an FI manager would deal with these criticisms in practice.

Duration Matching Can Be Costly. Critics charge that although in principle an FI manager can change  $D_{A}$  and  $D_{L}$  to immunize the FI against interest rate risk, restructuring the balance sheet of a large and complex FI can be both time-consuming and costly. This argument may have been true historically, but the growth of purchased funds, asset securitization, and loan sales markets has considerably eased the speed and lowered the transaction costs of major balance sheet restructurings. (See Chapter 25 for a discussion of these strategies.) Moreover, an FI manager could still manage interest rate risk exposure using the duration model by employing techniques other than direct portfolio rebalancing to immunize against interest rate risk. Managers can obtain many of the same results of direct duration matching by taking offsetting (hedging) positions in the markets for derivative securities, such as futures, forwards, options, and swaps (see Chapter 24).

Immunization Is a Dynamic Problem. Even though assets and liabilities are duration matched today, the same assets and liabilities may not be matched tomorrow. This is because the duration of assets and liabilities changes as they approach maturity, and, most importantly, the rate at which their durations change through time may not be the same on the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. As a result, the manager has to continuously restructure the balance sheet to remain immunized. In theory, the strategy requires the portfolio manager to rebalance the portfolio continuously to ensure that the durations of its assets and liabilities are matched. Because continuous rebalancing may not be easy to do and involves costly transaction fees, most FI managers seek to be only approximately dynamically immunized against interest rate changes by rebalancing at discrete intervals, such as quarterly. That is, FI managers accept the trade-off between being perfectly immunized and the transaction costs of maintaining an immunized balance sheet dynamically.

Large Interest Rate Changes and Convexity. Duration measures the price sensitivity of fixed-income securities for small changes in interest rates of the order of one basis point (or one hundredth of 1 percent). But suppose that interest rate shocks are much larger, of the order of 2 percent or 200 basis points. In this case, duration becomes a less accurate predictor of how much the prices of securities will change and, therefore, a less accurate measure of the interest rate sensitivity and the interest rate gap of an FI. Figure 23-2 is a graphic representation of the reason for this. Note the change in an asset's or liability's price, such as that of a bond, due to yield (interest rate) changes according to the duration model and the "true relationship," as calculated directly, using the exact present value calculation for a bond.

Specifically, the duration model predicts that the relationship between an interest rate change (or shock) and a bond's price change will be proportional to the bond's duration  $(D)$ . By precisely calculating the true change in the bond's price, however, we would find that for large interest rate increases, duration overpredicts the fall in the bond's price, and for large interest rate decreases, it underpredicts the increase in the bond's price. That is, the duration model predicts symmetric effects for rate increases and decreases on the bond's price. As Figure 23-2 shows, in actuality, the capital loss effect of rate increases tends to be smaller than the capital gain effect of rate decreases. This is the result of the bond's price-yield relationship exhibiting a property called convexity rather than linearity, as assumed by the basic duration model (see the more detailed discussion in Chapter 3). Nevertheless, an FI manager sufficiently concerned about the impact of large rate changes

# convexity

The degree of curvature of the price-yield curve around some interest rate level.

Figure 23-2 Duration Estimated versus True Bond Price


In the previous example, an important question for the FI manager is whether a 0.27 percent error is big enough to be concerned about. This depends on the size of the interest rate change and the size of the portfolio under management. Clearly, 0.27 percent of a large number will still be a large number!

# EXAMPLE 23-6 The Impact of Convexity for Large Interest Rate Changes

Consider a four-year bond that pays 8 percent coupons annually and has a yield to maturity of 10 percent. Table 23-8 shows that the market value of this bond is 936.603 (see point A in Figure 23-3) and the duration of this bond is 3.562 years. Suppose interest rates change such that the yield to maturity on the bond increases to 12 percent. The true market value of the bond (point B in Figure 23-3) decreases to:

$$

V _ {b} = \left(\frac {8 0}{1 + 0 . 1 2}\right) ^ {1} + \left(\frac {8 0}{1 + 0 . 1 2}\right) ^ {2} + \left(\frac {8 0}{1 + 0 . 1 2}\right) ^ {3} + \left(\frac {8 0}{1 + 0 . 1 2}\right) ^ {4} = \$ 8 7 8. 5 0 6

$$

This is a drop of 58.097. According to the duration model, however, the change in the bond's value is:

$$

P = 9 3 6. 6 0 3 \times (- 3. 5 6 2) \times (0. 0 2 / 1. 1 0) = - \$ 6 0. 6 5 8

$$ or the new bond value is 875.945 (point C in Figure 23-3).


The difference in these two values,  $2.561 ($ 878.506 - $875.945), (or, 0.29 percent [ $2.561/878.506]), is due to the convexity in the "true" market value calculation versus the linearity in the duration model. This linearity assumption leads to inaccuracies in the duration value calculations that increase with the size of the interest rate change.[12]

Reversing the experiment reveals that if the yield on the bond decreases from 10 percent to 8 percent, the true or actual price of the bond increases to 1,000.000 (point D in

11. Technically speaking, convexity can be viewed as the rate of change of the bond's value with respect to any interest rate change, whereas duration measures the change in a bond's value with respect to a change in interest rates.
12. Even allowing for convexity, there still may be a very small difference between the true change in the value of a bond and the value change predicted by the duration model adjusted for convexity. This is because convexity itself varies as the level of interest rates changes. In practice, few investors or fund managers concern themselves with this issue.

Figure 23-3). This is an increase in value of  $63.397. The duration model, however, predicts a$ 60.658 increase in the bond, or that the new bond value is $997.261 (point E in Figure 23-3). The duration model has underpredicted the bond price increase by $2.739, or by over 0.27 percent of the true price increase.

# INSOLVENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

In the previous two chapters and in this chapter, we have examined three major areas of risk exposure facing a modern FI manager. To ensure survival, an FI manager needs to protect the institution against the risk of insolvency—to shield it from those risks that are sufficiently large to cause the institution to fail. The primary means of protection against the risk of insolvency and failure is an FI's equity capital. However, capital also serves as a source of funds and as a necessary requirement for growth under the existing minimum capital-to-assets ratios set by regulators.

Indeed, part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008-2009 was the Capital Purchase Program, which was designed to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. Under the program, the Treasury purchased over  $205 billion in senior preferred stock issued by FIs. The senior preferred shares qualify as Tier I capital and rank senior to common stock. However, financial institutions had to meet certain standards. For example, they had to (1) ensure that incentive compensation for senior executives did not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threatened the value of the financial institution; (2) agree to pay back any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings, gains, or other criteria that were later proven to be materially inaccurate; (3) refrain from making any golden parachute payment to a senior executive based on the Internal Revenue Code provision; and (4) agree not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of$ 500,000 for each senior executive. In addition to capital injections received as part of the Capital Purchase Program, TARP provided additional emergency funding to Citigroup ($25 billion) and Bank of America ($20 billion). Through December 2019, $245 billion of TARP capital injections had been allocated to DIs, of which $239.8 billion had been paid back, along with a return of 35.8 billion in dividends and assessments.


FI managers may often prefer low levels of capital because they allow the institution to generate a higher return on equity for the firm's stockholders. The moral hazard problem of deposit insurance (see Chapter 13) exacerbates this tendency. However, this strategy results in a greater chance of insolvency. Since regulators are more concerned with the safety of the financial system than stockholder returns, there is a need for minimum capital requirements (Chapter 13 discussed the regulatory requirements on an FI's capital). In the remainder of this chapter, we focus on how various risks affect the level of an FI's capital.

# net worth

A measure of an FI's capital that is equal to the difference between the market value of its assets and the market value of its liabilities.

# book value

LG 23-4

# market value or mark-to-market value basis

Balance sheet values that reflect current rather than historical prices.

# Capital and Insolvency Risk

Capital. To understand how an FI's equity capital protects against insolvency risk, we must define capital more precisely. The problem is that equity capital has many definitions: an economist's definition of capital may differ from an accountant's definition, which in turn may differ from a regulator's definition. Specifically, the economist's definition of an FI's capital, or owners' equity stake, is the difference between the market values of its assets and its liabilities. This is also called an FI's net worth (see Chapter 12). This is the economic meaning of capital. But regulators and accountants have found it necessary to adopt definitions that depart by a greater or lesser degree from economic net worth. The concept of an FI's economic net worth is really a market value accounting concept. With the exception of the investment banking industry, regulatory- and accounting-defined capital and required leverage ratios are based in whole or in part on historical or book value accounting concepts.

We begin by looking at the role of economic capital or net worth as a device to protect against two of the major types of risk described in the previous chapters and in this chapter: credit risk and interest rate risk. We then compare this market value concept with the book value concept of capital. Because it can actually distort an FI's true solvency position, the book value of capital concept can be misleading to managers, owners, liability holders, and regulators alike. We also examine some possible reasons FI regulators continue to rely on book value concepts when such economic value transparency problems exist.

The Market Value of Capital. To understand how economic net worth insulates an FI against the risk of insolvency, consider the following example. Table 23-9 presents a simple balance sheet, where an FI's assets and liabilities are valued in market value terms. On a market value or mark-to-market value basis, asset and liability values are adjusted each day to reflect current market conditions. Thus, the economic value of the FI's equity

TABLE 23-9 An FI's Market Value Balance Sheet (in millions of dollars)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term securities</td><td>$ 80</td><td>Liabilities (short-term floating-rate deposits)</td><td>$ 90</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term loans</td><td>20</td><td>Net worth</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$100</td><td></td><td>$100</td></tr></table> is 10 million, which is the difference between the market value of its assets and liabilities, and it is economically solvent. Let's consider the impact of two classic types of FI risk—credit and interest rate—on this FI's net worth.


Market Value of Capital and Credit Risk. The balance sheet in Table 23-9 indicates that the FI has  $20 million in long-term loans. Suppose that as the result of a recession, a number of its borrowers have cash flow problems and are unable to keep up their promised loan repayment schedules. A decline in the current and expected future cash flows on loans lowers the market value of the FI's loan portfolio below$ 20 million. Suppose that loans are really worth only $12 million (the price the FI would receive if it could sell these loans in a secondary market). This means the market value of the loan portfolio has fallen from $20 million to 12 million. The revised market value balance sheet is presented in Table 23-10.

The loss of  $8 million in the market value of loans appears on the liability side of the balance sheet as a loss of$ 8 million of the FI's net worth—the loss of asset value is directly charged against the equity owners' capital or net worth. As you can see, the liability holders are fully protected because the total market value of their $90 million in liability claims is still $90 million. This is due to the fact that liability holders legally are senior claimants and equity holders are junior claimants to the FI's assets. Consequently, equity holders bear losses on the asset portfolio first. In fact, in this example, liability holders are hurt only when losses on the loan portfolio exceed 10 million (which was the FI's original net worth).

Let's consider a larger credit risk shock in which the market value of the loan portfolio plummets from  $20 million to$ 8 million, a loss of $12 million (see Table 23-11). This larger loss renders the FI insolvent. The market value of its assets ($88 million) is now less than the value of its liabilities ($90 million). The owners' net worth stake has been completely wiped out—reduced from $10 million to $0 million, resulting in zero net worth. Therefore, this hurts liability holders, but only a bit. Specifically, the equity holders bear the first $10 million of the 12 million loss in value of the loan portfolio. Only after the equity holders are completely wiped out do the liability holders begin to lose. In this example, the economic value of their claims on the FI has fallen from

$90 million to$ 88 million, or a loss of  $2 million (a percentage loss of 2.22 percent). After insolvency, the remaining$ 88 million in assets is liquidated and distributed to depositors. Note here that we are ignoring insurance guarantees afforded to some FI (e.g., bank) liability holders.[13]

This example clearly demonstrates the concept of net worth or capital as an "insurance" fund protecting liability holders against insolvency risk. The larger the FI's net worth relative to the size of its assets, the more insolvency protection its liability holders and, in some cases, liability guarantors such as the FDIC have. This is the reason that regulators focus on capital requirements such as the ratio of net worth to assets in assessing an FI's insolvency risk exposure and in setting deposit insurance premiums (see Chapter 13).

Market Value of Capital and Interest Rate Risk. Consider the market value balance sheet in Table 23-9 before interest rates rise. As we discussed earlier in the chapter, rising interest rates reduce the market value of the FI's long-term securities and loans, while floating-rate instruments find their market values largely unaffected if interest rates on such securities are instantaneously reset. Suppose that a rise in interest rates reduces the market value of the FI's long-term securities to  $75 million from$ 80 million and the market value of its long-term loans to $17 million from $20 million. Because all deposit liabilities are assumed to be short-term floating-rate deposits, their market values are unchanged at $90 million. After the shock to interest rates, the market value balance sheet is represented in Table 23-12. The loss of $8 million in the market value of the FI's assets is once again reflected on the liability side of the balance sheet by an $8 million decrease in net worth to $2 million. Thus, as with increased credit risk, the equity holders first bear losses in asset values due to adverse interest rate changes. Only if the fall in the market value of assets exceeds 10 million are the liability holders, as senior claimants to the FI's assets, adversely affected.

These examples show that market valuation of the balance sheet produces an economically accurate picture of net worth and, thus, an FI's solvency position. The equity holders directly bear the credit and interest rate risks that result in losses in the market value of assets and liabilities in the sense that such losses are charges against the value of their ownership claims in the FI. The market value of equity is more relevant than book value

As long as the owners' capital or equity stake is adequate, or sufficiently large, liability holders (and implicitly regulators that back the claims of liability holders) are protected against insolvency risk. If regulators were to close an FI before its economic net worth became zero, neither liability holders, nor those regulators guaranteeing the claims of liability holders, would stand to lose. Thus, many academics and analysts advocate the use of market value accounting and market value of capital closure rules for all FIs, especially because the book value of capital rules are closely associated with the savings institutions disaster in the 1980s (discussed in Chapter 13).


To see why book value of capital rules may incorrectly measure insolvency risk, consider the same credit and interest rate risk scenarios discussed above, but this time in a world where book value accounting and capital regulations hold sway.

The Book Value of Capital. Table 23-13 uses the same initial balance sheet as in Table 23-9, but assumes that assets and liabilities are now valued at their historical book values. In Table 23-13, the  $80 million in long-term securities and$ 20 million in long-term loans reflect the historical or original book values of those assets—that is, they reflect the (historical) values at the time the loans were made and the securities were purchased, which may have been many years ago when the economy was in a different stage of the business cycle and interest rates were at different levels. Similarly, on the liability side, the 90 million in liabilities also reflects their historical cost, so that the equity of the FI is now the book value of the stockholders' claims rather than the market value of those claims. For example, the book value of capital—the difference between the book value of an FI's assets and the book value of its liabilities—usually comprises the following three components in banking:

1. Par value of shares—the face value of the common shares issued by the FI (the par value is usually 1 per share) times the number of shares outstanding.
 2. Surplus value of shares—the difference between the price the public paid for common shares when originally offered (e.g., $5 per share) and their par values (e.g., $1), times the number of shares outstanding.
3. Retained earnings—the accumulated value of past profits not yet paid in dividends to shareholders. Since these earnings could be paid in dividends, they are part of the equity owners' stake in the FI. Consequently for an FI,

Book value of capital  $=$  Par value + Surplus + Retained earnings

As the balance sheet in Table 23-13 is constructed, the book value of capital equals 10 million. However, invariably, the book value of equity does not equal the market value of equity (the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities). This inequality between the book and market values of equity can be best understood by examining the effects of the same credit and interest rate shocks on the FI, but assuming book value rather than market value accounting methods.

The Book Value of Capital and Credit Risk. Suppose that some of the 20 million in loans are in difficulty due to the inability of businesses to maintain their repayment schedules. We assumed in Table 23-10 that the revaluation of the promised cash flows of loans leads to an immediate downward adjustment of the loan portfolio's market value from www.fasb.org


$20 million to$ 12 million, and a market value loss of 8 million. By contrast, under historical book value accounting methods, such as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), FIs have more discretion in reflecting and timing the recognition of loan loss on their balance sheets, and thus more control over the impact of such losses on capital.

Indeed, managers of FIs may well resist writing down the values of bad assets as long as possible to try to present a more favorable picture to depositors, shareholders, and regulators. Such resistance might be expected if managers believe that the recognition of such losses could threaten their careers. Similarly, FI managers can selectively sell assets to inflate their reported capital. For example, managers can sell assets that have market values above their book values, resulting in an increase in the book value of capital. Only pressure from auditors and regulators such as bank, thrift, and insurance examiners may force loss recognition and write-downs of the values of problem assets. For example, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 includes a push for DIs to accrue more loan loss reserves during good times. Prior to the financial crisis, DIs had been restricted by accounting standards and the SEC from building capital for loan loss reserves that were likely to occur but difficult to predict. Therefore, banks felt pressured to keep reserves low. The restrictions worsened the effects of the financial crisis for DIs as the reserves they had set aside prior to the crisis did not cover their losses during the financial crisis and left them scrambling for capital.

Book Value of Capital and Interest Rate Risk. Although book value accounting systems recognize credit risk problems, albeit only partially and usually with a long and discretionary time lag, their failure to recognize the impact of interest rate risk is even more extreme. In the market value accounting example in Table 23-12, a rise in interest rates lowered the market values of long-term securities and loans by  $8 million and led to a fall in the market value of net worth from$ 10 million to 2 million. In a book value accounting world, when all assets and liabilities reflect their original cost of purchase, the rise in interest rates has no effect on the value of assets, liabilities, or the book value of equity—the balance sheet remains unchanged. Table 23-13 reflects the position both before and after the interest rate rise. This was the case for those thrifts that continued to report long-term fixed-rate mortgages at historical book values even though interest rates rose dramatically in the early 1980s. As a result, these FIs continued to record a positive book value of capital position. On a market value net worth basis, however, their mortgages were worth far less than the book values shown on their balance sheets. Indeed, more than half of the firms in the industry were economically insolvent, many massively so.

The Discrepancy between the Market and Book Values of Equity. The degree to which the book value of an FI's capital deviates from its true economic market value depends on a number of factors, especially:

1. Interest rate volatility—the higher the interest rate volatility, the greater the discrepancy.
2. Examination and enforcement—the more frequent are on-site and off-site examinations and the stiffer the examiner/regulator standards regarding charging off problem loans, the smaller the discrepancy.
3. Asset trading—the more assets that are traded, the easier it is to assess the true market value of the asset portfolio.

In actual practice, we can get an idea of the discrepancy between book values (BV) and market values (MV) of equity for large publicly traded FIs even when the FI does not mark its balance sheet to market. Specifically, in an efficient capital market, the FI's stock price reflects the market value of the FI's outstanding equity shares. This valuation is based on the FI's current and expected future net earnings or dividend flows. The market value of equity per share (MV) is therefore:

$$

M V = \frac {\text {M a r k e t v a l u e o f e q u i t y o w i n s h i p i n s h a r e s o u t s t a n d i n g}}{\text {N u m b e r o f s h a r e s}}

By contrast, the historical or book value of the FI's equity per share (BV) is equal to:

$$

# market-to-book ratio

A ratio that shows the discrepancy between the stock market value of an FI's equity and the book value of its equity.

The ratio MV/BV is often called the market-to-book ratio and shows the degree of discrepancy between the market value of an FI's equity capital as perceived by investors in the stock market and the book value of capital on its balance sheet. The higher the market-to-book ratio, the more the book value of capital understates an FI's true equity or economic net worth position as perceived by investors in the capital market. If the market-to-book value is less than 1, the FI's equity is perceived by investors in the stock market to be worth less than the book value of its capital. Table 23-14 lists the market-to-book ratios for selected U.S. depository institutions. The values range from a low of 0.980 times for Citigroup to 2.583 times for BB&T and Trust Financial.

Arguments against Market Value Accounting. The first argument against market value (MV) accounting it that it is difficult to implement. This may be especially true for small commercial banks and thrifts with large amounts of nontraded assets such as small loans in their balance sheets. When market prices or values for assets cannot be determined accurately, marking to market may be done only with error. A counterargument to this is that the error resulting from the use of market valuation of nontraded assets is still likely to be less than that resulting from the use of original book or historical valuation since the market value approach does not require all assets and liabilities to be traded. As long as current and expected cash flows on an asset or liability and an appropriate discount rate can be specified, approximate market values can always be imputed. Indeed, with the increase of loan sales and asset securitization (see Chapter 25), indicative market prices are available on an increasing variety of loans.

Further, during the financial crisis, the Financial Accounting Standards Board clarified its position on the application of market value accounting where there are limited or no observable inputs for marking certain assets to market, as was the case with many of the mortgage-backed securities at the center of the crisis. The guidance does not eliminate market value accounting, but it does provide management with much more discretion with respect to applying the convention when pricing illiquid assets. This discretion includes the ability to use internal assumptions with respect to future cash flows, which means employing generally more benign estimates than what the "market" is currently imposing. The guidance specifically allows management to use internal cash flow models and assumptions to estimate fair value when there are limited market data available.

# DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

6. Why an FI can be economically insolvent when its book value of net worth is positive?
7. What the major components of an FI's book value of equity are?
8. Whether book value accounting for loan losses is backward or forward looking?
9. What a market-to-book ratio that is less than 1 implies about an FI's performance?
10. What the arguments against the use of market value accounting are?

A second argument against market value accounting is that it introduces an unnecessary degree of variability into an FI's earnings—and thus net worth—because paper capital gains and losses on assets are passed through the income statement. Critics argue that reporting unrealized capital gains and losses is distortionary if the FI actually plans to hold these assets to maturity. FI managers argue that in many cases, they do hold loans and other assets to maturity and, therefore, never actually realize capital gains or losses. Further, regulators have argued that they may be forced to close banks too early under the prompt corrective action requirements imposed by the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 (see Chapter 13), especially if an interest rate spike is only temporary (as much empirical evidence shows) and capital losses on securities can be quickly turned into capital gains as rates fall again. The counterargument is that FIs are increasingly trading, selling, and securitizing assets rather than holding them to maturity. Further, the failure to reflect capital gains and losses from interest rate changes means that the FI's equity position fails to reflect its true interest rate risk exposure.

In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which sets accounting rules for U.S. firms) eased its stance on marking-to-market such that DIs (as well as other firms) that meet certain conditions are no longer required to take earnings hits when asset markets are flawed. Specifically, the FASB ruling allows DIs to avoid market losses by stating that they intend to hold on to the asset and that it is more likely than not that they will. The rule says that once an asset is other than temporarily impaired, only losses related to the underlying creditworthiness shall affect earnings and regulatory capital. Losses attributed to market conditions are disclosed and accounted for elsewhere. The rule draws a distinction that is especially relevant to mortgage-backed securities, a market that had largely dried up during the financial crisis.

A third argument against market value accounting is that FIs are less willing to accept longer-term asset exposures, such as mortgage loans and C&I loans, if these assets must be continually marked to market to reflect changing credit quality and interest rates. For example, as discussed earlier in the chapter, long-term assets are more interest rate sensitive than are short-term assets. The concern is that market value accounting may interfere with FIs' special functions (see Chapter 1) as lenders and monitors and may even result in (or accentuate) a major credit crunch. Of the three arguments against market value accounting, this one is probably the most persuasive to regulators concerned about small business finance and economic growth.

# SUMMARY

This chapter provided a look at the measurement and on-balance-sheet management of interest rate and insolvency risks. The chapter first introduced two methods used to measure an FI's interest rate risk exposure: the repricing gap model and the duration gap model. The repricing gap model concentrates only on the net interest income effects of rate changes and ignores balance sheet or market value effects. As such it gives a partial, but potentially misleading, picture of an FI's interest rate risk exposure. The duration gap model is superior to the simple repricing gap model because it incorporates the effects of interest rate changes on the market values of assets and liabilities. The chapter concluded with an analysis of the role of an FI's capital in insulating it against credit, interest rate, and other risks. According to economic theory, shareholder equity capital or economic net worth should be measured on a market value basis as the difference between the market value of an FI's assets and liabilities. In actuality, regulators use a mixture of book value and market value accounting rules. For example, FIs are required to mark-to-market investment securities held as trading assets, while being able to carry most loans at their book values. This mix of book value and market value accounting for various assets and liabilities creates a potential distortion in the measured net worth of the FI.
