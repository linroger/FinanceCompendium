# WHY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SELL AND SECURITIZE LOANS: CHAPTER OVERVIEW

LG 25-1 Loan sales and securitization—the packaging and selling of loans and other assets backed by loans issued by the FI—are mechanisms that FIs have used to hedge their credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk exposures. In addition, loan sales and securitization have allowed FI asset portfolios to become more liquid, provided an important source of fee income (with FIs acting as servicing agents for the assets sold), and helped reduce the adverse effects of regulatory "taxes" such as capital requirements, reserve requirements, and deposit insurance premiums on FI profitability. Loan sales involve splitting up larger loans and loan portfolios, whereas loan securitization involves the grouping of smaller loans into larger pools. While loan sales have been in existence for many years, the use of loan sales (by removing existing loans from the balance sheet) is increasingly being recognized as a valuable tool in an FI manager's portfolio of credit risk management techniques. In Chapter 1, we discussed the role of FIs as both asset transformers and asset brokers. By increasingly relying on loan sales and securitization, FIs such as depository institutions have begun moving away from being strictly asset transformers that originate and hold assets to maturity toward becoming more reliant on servicing and other fees. This makes depository institutions look increasingly similar to securities firms and investment banks in terms of the enhanced importance of asset brokerage over asset transformation functions.

# TABLE 25-1 Basic Description of Loan Sales and Other Forms of Mortgage Securitization

Loan sale—an FI originates a loan and subsequently sells it.

Pass-through securities—mortgages or other assets originated by an FI are pooled and investors are offered an interest in the pool in the form of pass-through certificates or securities.

Examples of pass-through securities are Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) securities.

Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)—similar to pass-throughs, CMOs are securities backed by pools of mortgages or other assets originated by an FI. Pass-throughs give investors common rights in terms of risks and returns, but CMOs assign varying combinations of risk and return to different groups of investors in the CMO by repackaging the pool.

Mortgage-backed bonds (MBBs)—a bond issue backed by a group of mortgages on an FI's balance sheet. With MBBs, the mortgages remain on the FI's balance sheet and funds used to pay the MBB holders' coupons and principal repayments may or may not come from the collateralized mortgages.

In Chapter 7, we discussed the basics of asset sales and securitization and the markets in which these securities trade. This chapter investigates the role of loan sales and other forms of asset securitization in improving the return-risk trade-off for FIs. However, as seen in the midand late 2000s with assets backed with subprime mortgages, asset securitization can result in huge losses if the underlying assets do not pay as promised. This chapter describes the process associated with loan sales and the major forms, or vehicles, of asset securitization and analyzes their unique characteristics. Table 25-1 presents a definition of the loan sale and securitization mechanisms that this chapter discusses.

# LOAN SALES

# loan sale

Sale of a loan originated by a bank with or without recourse to an outside buyer.

# recourse

The ability of a loan buyer to sell the loan back to the originator should it go bad.

# correspondent banking

A relationship between a small bank and a large bank in which the large bank provides a number of deposit, lending, and other services.

A loan sale occurs when an FI originates a loan and sells it with or without recourse to an outside buyer. If the loan is sold without recourse, the FI not only removes it from its balance sheet (purchasing new investments with the freed-up funds), but it also has no explicit liability if the loan eventually goes bad. The loan buyer (not the FI that originated the loan) bears all the credit risk. If, however, the loan is sold with recourse, under certain conditions the buyer can put the loan back to the selling FI. Therefore, the FI retains a contingent (credit risk) liability. In practice, most loan sales are without recourse because a loan sale is technically removed from the balance sheet only when the buyer has no future credit risk claim on the FI. Loan sales usually involve no creation of new types of securities, such as those described later in the chapter when we consider the securitization activities of FIs.

FIs have sold loans among themselves for more than 100 years. In fact, a large part of correspondent banking involves small FIs making loans that are too big for them to hold on their balance sheets—either for lending concentration risk or capital adequacy reasons—and selling (or syndicating) parts of these loans to large FIs with whom they have had a long-term deposit-lending correspondent relationship. In turn, the large banks often sell (or syndicate) parts of their loans (called participations) to smaller FIs. The syndicated loan market—that is, the market for buying and selling loans once they have been originated—can be segmented into three categories: market makers, active traders, and occasional sellers/investors. Market makers are generally the large commercial banks (e.g., JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs), which commit capital to create liquidity and take outright positions in the markets. Institutions that actively engage in primary loan origination have an advantage in trading on the secondary market, mainly because of their acquired skill in accessing and understanding loan documentation. Active traders are mainly investment banks, commercial banks, and vulture funds (see below). Other financial institutions such as insurance companies also trade but to a lesser extent. Occasional participants are either sellers of loans (who seek to remove loans from their balance sheets to meet regulatory constraints or to manage their exposures) or buyers of loans (who seek exposure to sectors or countries, especially when they do not have the critical size to do so in the primary loan markets).

# highly leveraged transaction (HLT) loan

A loan that finances a merger and acquisition; a leveraged buyout results in a high leverage ratio for the borrower.

Even though this market has existed for many years, it grew slowly until the early 1980s when it entered a period of spectacular growth, largely due to expansion in highly leveraged transaction (HLT) loans to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Specifically, the volume of loans sold by U.S. banks increased from less than  $20 billion in 1980 to$ 285 billion in 1989. Many of these loans were sold at far less than their original book value (i.e., they were classified as distressed loans, or loans trading below 90 cents on the dollar). These losses reduced bank capital to the extent that many banks (and savings institutions) failed (see Chapter 14). In the early 1990s, the volume of loan sales declined dramatically, along with the decline in LBO and M&A activity. In 1991, the volume of loan sales had fallen to approximately $10 billion. In the late 1990s, the volume of loan sales expanded again, partly due to an expanding economy and a resurgency in M&As. For example, the loan market research firm Loan Pricing Corporation reported that secondary trading volume in 1999 was more than $79 billion. Loan sales continued to grow to almost $120 billion in the early 2000s as FIs sold distressed loans. Triggered by an economic slowdown, distressed loan sales jumped from 11 percent of total loan sales in 1999 to 36 percent in 2001, and 42 percent in 2002. As the U.S. economy improved in the early and mid-2000s, the percentage of distressed loan sales fell (e.g., to 17 percent in 2006). Even as the economy slowed in 2007 and 2008, while loans sales surged to over $500 billion, distressed loan sales remained low. In 2007, distressed loans were just 9 percent of total loan sales, and in 2008 they were under 8 percent of all loan sales. Loan sales fell only slightly (to 474 billion) in 2009, during the worst of the financial crisis. However, as might be expected during a recession, the percent of distressed loans increased significantly, to almost 30 percent. Loan sales decreased slightly in 2010, as the U.S. economy began to improve. However, distressed loans remained high, over 20 percent. In 2011 and 2012, the U.S. economy continued to struggle and loan sales growth remained flat. However, the percent of distressed loans decreased significantly, to 8.7 and 5.5 percent in 2011 and 2012, respectively, as many financial institutions had already sold off their marketable distressed loans in 2009 and 2010. Figure 25-1 shows the growth in loan sales over the period 1991-2019.

# Types of Loan Sales Contracts

The two basic types of loan sales contracts are participations and assignments. Currently, assignments represent the bulk of loan sales.

# participation in a loan

The act of buying a share in a loan syndication with limited contractual control and rights over the borrower.

Participations. The unique characteristics of participations in loans are:

- The holder (buyer) is not a party to the underlying (primary) credit agreement, so that the initial contract between the loan seller (which may be a syndicate of FIs) and the borrower remains in place after the sale.
- The loan buyer can exercise only partial control over changes in the loan contract's terms. The holder can vote on only material changes to the loan contract, such as the interest rate or collateral backing.

The economic implication of these characteristics is that the buyer of the loan participation has a double risk exposure—to the borrower as well as to the original lender (or lenders). Specifically, if the selling FI fails, the loan participation bought by an outside party may be characterized as an unsecured obligation of the FI rather than a true sale. Alternatively, the borrowers' claims against a failed selling FI may be netted against its loans, reducing the amount of loans outstanding and adversely impacting the buyer of a participation in those loans. As a result of these exposures, the buyer bears a double monitoring cost as well.

# assignment

The purchase of a share in a loan syndication with some contractual control and rights over the borrower.

Assignments. Because of the monitoring costs and the risks involved in participations, loans are sold on an assignment basis in more than 90 percent of the cases on the U.S. domestic market. The key features of an assignment are:

- All ownership rights are transferred on sale, meaning that the loan buyer holds a direct claim on the borrower.
- U.S. domestic loans are normally transferred with a Uniform Commercial Code filing, meaning there is documentation of a change of ownership in which the buyer has first claim on the borrower's assets in the event of bankruptcy.

Although ownership rights are generally much clearer in a loan sale by assignment, contractual terms frequently limit the seller's (e.g., an FI's) scope regarding to whom the loan can be sold. A loan sale by assignment means the borrower (e.g., IBM) must negotiate any changes on the loan with an FI it may have had no prior relationship with or knowledge of. To protect the borrower (IBM), the original loan contract may require either the FI agent or the borrower (IBM) to agree to the sale. (An FI agent is an FI that distributes interest and principal payments to lenders in loan syndications with multiple lenders.) The loan contract may also restrict the sale to a certain class of institutions, such as those that meet certain net worth/net asset size conditions (say, Allstate Insurance Company). Currently, the trend appears to be toward originating loan contracts with very limited assignment restrictions. This is true in both the U.S. domestic and foreign loan sales markets. The most tradable loans are those that can be assigned without buyer restrictions. In evaluating ownership rights, the buyer of the loan (Allstate) also needs to verify the original loan contract and to establish the full implications of the purchase regarding the buyer's (Allstate's) rights to collateral if the borrower (IBM) defaults. Because of these contractual problems, trading frictions, and costs, some loan sales take as long as three months to complete, although for most loan sales the developing market standard is that loan sales should be completed within 10 days.

# LG 25-2

# LDC loans

Loans made to a less developed country (LDC).

# The Loan Sales Market

The U.S. loan sales market has three segments: two involve sales and trading of domestic loans and the third involves sales of LDC loans (less developed country loans that have been made to certain Asian, African, and Latin American countries).

Traditional Short-Term Segment. In the traditional short-term segment of the market, FIs sell loans with short maturities, often one to three months. This market has characteristics similar to those of the market for commercial paper (see Chapter 5) in that loan sales have similar maturities and issue sizes. Loan sales, however, usually have yields that are 1 to 10 basis points above those of commercial paper of a similar rating and, unlike commercial paper, are secured by the assets of the borrowing firm. However, commercial paper issuers generally are blue chip corporations that have the best credit ratings. Banks may sell the loans of less creditworthy borrowers, thereby raising required yields. Indeed, since commercial paper issuers tend to be well-known companies, information, monitoring, and credit assessment costs are lower for commercial paper issues than for loan sales. Moreover, since there is an active secondary market in commercial paper, but not for loan sales, the commercial paper buyer takes on less liquidity risk than does the buyer of a loan sale. The key characteristics of the loans bought and sold in the short-term loan sales market are:

The loans are secured by assets of the borrowing firm or other external guarantors.

They have been made to investment-grade borrowers or better.

They are issued for a short term (90 days or less).

 They are sold in units of 1 million and up.

- Loan rates are closely tied to the commercial paper rate.

Traditional short-term loan sales dominated the market until 1984 and the emergence of the HLT and LDC loan markets. The growth of the commercial paper market (see Chapter 5) has also reduced the importance of this market segment.

HLT Loan Sales. With the increase in M&As and LBOs financed via highly leveraged transactions (HLTs), especially from 1985 to 1989, a new segment in the loan sales market, HLT loan sales or highly leveraged loan market, appeared. HLT loans mainly differ according to whether they are nondistressed (bid price exceeds 90 cents per $1 of loans) or distressed (bid price is less than 90 cents per $1 of loans or the borrower is in default).

Virtually all HLT loans have the following characteristics:

They are secured by assets of the borrowing firm (usually given senior security status).

They have long maturity (often threeto six-year maturities).

- They have floating rates tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the prime rate, or a CD rate (HLT rates are normally 200–275 basis points above these rates).
They have strong covenant protection.

# financial distress

The state when a borrower is unable to meet a payment obligation to lenders and other creditors.

# vulture fund

A specialized fund that invests in distressed loans.

Nevertheless, HLTs tend to be quite heterogeneous with respect to the size of the issue, the interest payment date, interest indexing, and prepayment features. After origination, some HLT borrowers such as Macy's and El Paso Electric have suffered periods of financial distress in that they were unable to make timely payments on many of the bonds they had issued and loans they had outstanding. As a result, a distinction between the market for distressed and nondistressed HLTs is usually made.

The Buyers. Of the wide array of potential buyers, some are interested in only a certain segment of the market for regulatory and strategic reasons. In particular, an increasingly specialized group of buyers of distressed loans includes investment banks and vulture funds. For the nondistressed market and the traditional U.S. domestic loan sales market, the seven major buyers are investment banks, vulture funds, other domestic banks, foreign banks, insurance companies and pension funds, closed-end bank loan mutual funds, and nonfinancial corporations.

Investment Banks. Investment banks are predominantly buyers of loans because (1) analysis of these loans utilizes investment skills similar to those required for junk bond trading and (2) investment banks are often closely associated with the borrower in underwriting the original junk bond/HLT deals. As such, large investment banks—for example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs—are relatively more informed agents in this market, either by acting as market makers or in taking short-term positions on movements in the market prices of these loans.

Vulture Funds. Vulture funds are specialized investment funds established to invest in distressed loans, often with an agenda that does not include helping the distressed firm survive. These investments can be active, especially for those seeking to use the loans purchased for bargaining in a restructuring deal, which generates restructuring returns that strongly favor the loan purchaser. Alternatively, such loans may be held as passive investments or high-yield securities in a well-diversified portfolio of distressed securities. Investment banks, in fact, manage many vulture funds. Most secondary market trading in U.S. loan sales occurs in this segment of the market.

Other Domestic Banks. Interbank loan sales are at the core of the traditional market and historically have revolved around correspondent banking and regional banking/branching restrictions. Restrictions on nationwide banking in the past led banks to originate regionally undiversified and borrower undiversified loan portfolios. Small banks often sold loan participations to their large correspondents to improve regional/borrower diversification and to avoid regulatory imposed single-borrower loan concentration ceilings. (A loan to a single borrower should not exceed 10 percent of a bank's capital.) This arrangement also worked in the other direction, with the larger banks selling participations to smaller banks.

The traditional interbank market, however, has been shrinking as a result of three factors. First, the traditional correspondent banking relationship is breaking down as markets become more competitive. Second, concerns about counterparty risk and moral hazard have increased. In particular, moral hazard is the risk that the selling bank will seek to offload its "bad" loans (via loan sales), keeping the "good" loans in its portfolio. Third, the barriers to nationwide banking have been removed, particularly following the full implementation of interstate banking in 1997 (after the passage of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act in 1994) and the (continuing) contraction in the number of small banks (see Chapter 13). Nevertheless, some small banks find the loan sales market enormously useful as a way to regionally diversify their loan portfolios.

Foreign Banks. Foreign banks remain the dominant buyer of domestic U.S. loans. Because of the cost of branching, the loan sales market allows foreign banks to achieve a well-diversified domestic U.S. loan portfolio without developing a nationwide banking network.

Insurance Companies and Pension Funds. Subject to meeting liquidity and credit quality restrictions (such as buying only BBB rated loans or above), insurance companies (such as Aetna) and pension funds are important buyers of long-term loans.

Closed-End Bank Loan Mutual Funds. First established in 1988, these leveraged mutual funds, such as Highland Capital Management of Dallas, Texas, invest in domestic U.S. bank loans. Although they could purchase loans in the loan sales market, the largest funds have moved into primary loan syndications as well because of the attractive fee income available. These mutual funds increasingly participate in funding loans originated by commercial banks. Indeed, some money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, have actively encouraged closed-end fund participation in primary loan syndications.

Nonfinancial Corporations. Some corporations—primarily the financial services arms of the very largest U.S. and European companies (e.g., GE Capital and ITT Financial)—buy loans. This activity amounts to no more than 5 percent of total U.S. domestic loan sales.

The Sellers. The sellers of domestic loans and HLT loans are major money center banks, small regional or community banks, foreign banks, investment banks, and the U.S. government.

Major Money Center Banks. The largest money center banks have dominated loan selling. In recent years, market concentration in loan selling has been accentuated by the increase in HLTs (and the important role that major money center banks have played in originating loans in HLT deals) as well as growth in real estate loan sales.

Small Regional or Community Banks. As mentioned earlier, small banks sell loans and loan participations to larger FIs for diversification and regulatory purposes. Although they are not a major player in the loan sales market, small banks have found loan sales to be essential for diversifying their credit risk.

Foreign Banks. To the extent that foreign banks are sellers rather than buyers of loans, these loans come from branch networks such as the Japanese-owned banks in California or through selling loans originated in their home country in U.S. loan sales markets.

Investment Banks. Investment banks such as Merrill Lynch (a subsidiary of Bank of America) act as loan sellers either as part of their loan origination activities or as active traders in the market.

The U.S. Government and Its Agencies. In recent years, the U.S. government and its agencies have shown an increased willingness to engage in loan sales. This has been aided by the passage of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which authorizes federal agencies to sell delinquent and defaulted loan assets. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also has been an increasingly large seller of mortgage loans on multifamily apartment properties. However, the largest loan sales by a government agency to date have been made by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Established in 1989 and disbanded at the end of 1995, the RTC had to resolve more than 700 problem savings institutions through merger, closure, or conservatorship. With respect to the U.S. commercial and industrial loan sales market, RTC dispositions had a relatively moderate supply-side effect largely because the bulk of RTC's asset sales were real estate assets (such as multifamily mortgages). The tendency of the RTC was to combine good and bad loans into loan packages and sell them at auction to bidders.

# Secondary Market for Less Developed Country Debt

Since the mid-1980s, a secondary market for trading less developed country (LDC) debt has developed among large commercial and investment banks in New York and London. The volume of trading has grown dramatically, from around  $2 billion per year in 1984 to over$ 6 billion today. Like domestic loan sales, the removal of LDC loans from the balance sheet allows an FI to free up assets for other investments. Further, being able to sell these loans—even if at a price below the face value of the original loan—may signify that the FI's balance sheet is sufficiently strong to bear the loss. In fact, a number of studies have found that announcements of FIs writing down the value of LDC loans—prior to their charge-off and sale—have a positive effect on FI stock prices. For example, on May 19, 1987, Citicorp announced that the bank was adding a staggering $3 billion to its reserves against losses on loans to developing countries. In the week following the announcement, Citicorp's stock rose from $50.625 to 55.375.

In recent years, there have been a large number of changes in the structure of the market. Now there are three market segments: sovereign bonds, performing loans, and nonperforming loans. $^{2}$  The first segment of the LDC debt market is that for sovereign bonds (i.e., government-issued debt). Sovereign bonds have historically been issued in foreign currencies, either U.S. dollars or euros. LDC sovereign debt tends to have lower credit ratings than other sovereign debt because of the increased economic and political risks. The second segment of the LDC debt market is that for performing LDC loans. Performing loans are original or restructured outstanding sovereign loans on which the sovereign country is currently maintaining promised payments to lenders or debt holders. Any discounts from 100 percent reflect expectations that these countries may face repayment problems in the future. The third segment of the LDC market is that for nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans reflect the secondary market prices for the sovereign loans of countries where there are no interest or principal payments currently being made. These are normally traded at very deep discounts from 100 percent.

# Factors Encouraging Future Loan Sales Growth

The introduction to this chapter stated that one reason that FIs sell loans is to manage their credit risk better. Loan sales remove assets (and credit risk) from the balance sheet and allow an FI to achieve better asset diversification. Other than credit risk management, however, FIs are encouraged to sell loans for a number of other economic and regulatory reasons.

Fee Income. An FI can often report any fee income earned from originating loans as current income, but interest earned on direct lending can be accrued (as income) only over time (see Chapter 12). As a result, originating and quickly selling loans can boost an FI's reported income under current accounting rules.

**Liquidity Risk.** In addition to credit risk, holding loans on the balance sheet can increase the overall illiquidity of an FI's assets. This illiquidity is a problem because FI liabilities tend to be highly liquid. Asset illiquidity can expose the FI to harmful liquidity problems when depositors unexpectedly withdraw their deposits. To mitigate a liquidity problem, an FI's management can sell some of its loans to outside investors (see Chapter 22). Thus, the FI loan market has created a secondary market that has significantly reduced the illiquidity of loans held as assets on the balance sheet.

Capital Costs. The capital adequacy requirements imposed on FIs are a burden as long as required capital exceeds the amount the FI believes to be privately beneficial. Thus, FIs struggling to meet a required capital-to-assets  $(K / A)$  ratio can boost this ratio by reducing assets  $(A)$  rather than boosting capital  $(K)$ —see Chapter 13. One way to downsize or reduce  $A$  and boost the  $K / A$  ratio is through loan sales.

Reserve Requirements. Regulatory requirements, such as reserves that a bank must hold at the central bank, represent a form of tax that adds to the cost of funding the loan portfolio. Regulatory taxes such as reserve requirements create an incentive for banks to

2. A fourth, but very small, market is that for Brady bonds. Brady bonds reflect programs under which the U.S. and other FIs have exchanged their dollar loans for dollar bonds issued by the relevant less developed countries (LDCs). These bonds have a much longer maturity than that promised on the original loans and a lower promised original coupon (yield) than the interest rate on the original loan. However, the principal usually has been collateralized through the issuing country's purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds and holding them in a special-purpose escrow account. Should that country default on its Brady bonds, the buyers of the bonds could access the dollar bonds held as collateral. These loan-for-bond restructuring programs, also called debt-for-debt swaps, were developed under the auspices of the U.S. Treasury's 1989 Brady Plan and international organizations such as the IMF. Once loans were swapped for bonds by banks and other FIs, they could be sold on the secondary market. The Brady bond process ended in the 1990s. Yet a small amount of these bonds still exist and trade.
3. However, if FIs primarily sell high-quality loans, the average quality of the remaining loans may actually decrease. 4. Under current reserve requirement regulations (Regulation D, amended May 1986), bank loan sales with recourse are regarded as a liability and hence are subject to reserve requirements. The reservability of loan sales extends to a bank issuing a credit guarantee and a recourse provision. Loans sold without recourse (or credit guarantees by the selling bank) are free of reserve requirements. With the elimination of reserve requirements on nontransaction accounts and the lowering of reserve requirements on transaction accounts in 1991, the reserve tax effect is likely to become a less important feature driving bank loan sales (as well as the recourse/nonrecourse mix) in the future.

remove loans from the balance sheet by selling them without recourse to outside parties. Such removal allows banks to shrink both their assets and deposits and, thus, the amount of reserves they have to hold against their deposits.

# Factors Deterring Future Loan Sales Growth

The loan sales market has experienced a number of up-and-down phases in recent years. Notwithstanding the value of loan sales as a credit risk management tool and other reasons described above, a number of factors may deter the market's growth and development in the future. We discuss these next.

Access to the Commercial Paper Market. Since 1987, large banks have enjoyed much greater powers to underwrite commercial paper directly, without experiencing legal challenges by the securities industry claiming that underwriting by banks is contrary to the Glass-Steagall Act. These underwriting powers were expanded in 1999 with the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act, which eliminated Glass-Steagall restrictions on underwriting activities such as commercial paper underwriting (see Chapter 13). This means that the need to underwrite or sell short-term bank loans as an imperfect substitute for commercial paper underwriting has now become much less important. In addition, more and more smaller middle market firms are gaining direct access to the commercial paper market. As a result, such firms have less need to rely on bank loans to finance their short-term expenditures, with fewer loan originations generally resulting in fewer loans being sold.

Customer Relationship Effects. As the financial institutions industry consolidates and expands the range of financial services sold, customer relationships have become even more important. To the extent that a loan customer (borrower) views the sale of its loan by its FI as an adverse statement about the customer's value to the FI, loan sales can harm revenues generated by the FI as current and potential future customers take their business elsewhere.

Legal Concerns. A number of legal concerns are currently hampering the loan sales market's growth, especially for distressed loans. In particular, although FIs are normally secured creditors, other creditors may attack this status through fraudulent conveyance proceedings if the borrowing firm enters bankruptcy. Fraudulent conveyance is any transfer of assets (such as a loan sale) at less than fair value made by a firm while it is insolvent. Fraudulent conveyance prevents an insolvent firm from giving away its assets or selling them at unreasonably low prices and thereby depriving its remaining creditors of fair treatment on liquidation or bankruptcy. For example, fraudulent conveyance proceedings have been brought against the secured lenders to firms such as Revco, Circle K, Allied Stores, and RJR Nabisco. In these cases, the sale of loans to a particular party were found to be illegal. More recently, in late 2011 the FHFA (the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) sued 17 different financial institutions (including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup) for misrepresenting the quality of mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As of late 2013, the FHFA had secured  $28 billion from banks, including$ 6.97 billion from Bank of America, $4 billion from JPMorgan Chase, $3.68 billion from Royal Bank of Scotland, and 1.35 billion from Goldman Sachs. Further, in October 2012 the U.S. Justice Department filed a complaint against Bank of America claiming that the bank and its Countrywide Financial unit generated thousands of defective loans and sold them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The lawsuit was the sixth brought against a major U.S. bank by the Justice Department in less than 18 months. As discussed earlier, contractual terms in loan contracts can limit the loan originator's scope regarding to whom the loan can be sold. Fraudulent conveyance proceedings are challenges of loan sales as defined in the original loan contract. Such lawsuits represent one of the factors that have slowed the growth of the distressed loan market.

# LOAN SECURITIZATION

LG 25-4

Loan securitization involves a change of strategy from a traditional FI's policy of holding the loans it originates on its balance sheet until maturity. Instead, loan securitization consists of packaging loans or other assets into newly created securities and selling these asset-backed securities (ABS) to investors. By packaging and selling loans to outside parties, the FI removes considerable liquidity, interest rate, and credit risk from its asset portfolio. Rather than holding loans on the balance sheet until maturity, shortly after origination, the originate-to-distribute model entails the FI's sale of the loan and other asset-backed securities for cash, which can then be used to originate new loans/ assets, thereby starting the securitization cycle over again. Thus, the process of securitization allows FIs' asset portfolios to become more liquid, provides an important source of fee income (with FIs acting as servicing agents for the assets sold), and helps reduce the effects of regulatory taxes such as capital requirements, reserve requirements, and deposit insurance premiums.

Credit derivatives, such as asset securitization and credit default swaps, allow investors to separate the credit risk exposure from the lending process itself. That is, FIs can assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants, originate loans, fund loans, and even monitor and service loans without retaining exposure to loss from credit events, such as default or missed payments. This decoupling of the risk from the lending activity allows the market to efficiently transfer risk across counterparties. However, it also loosens the incentives to carefully perform each of the steps of the lending process. This loosening of incentives was an important factor leading to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, which witnessed the aftereffects of poor loan underwriting, inferior documentation and due diligence, failure to monitor borrower activity, and fraudulent activity on the part of both lenders and borrowers. Although bank regulators attempt to examine the off-balance-sheet activities of banks to ascertain their safety and soundness, there is far less scrutiny off the balance sheet than there is for on-balance-sheet activities (i.e., traditional lending and deposit taking). To the extent that counterparty credit risk was not fully disclosed to, or monitored by, regulators, the increased use of these innovations transferred risk in ways that were not necessarily scrutinized or understood. It was in this context of increased risk and inadequate regulation that the credit crisis developed.

This section discusses the three major forms of securitization—pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and mortgage-backed bonds—and analyzes their unique characteristics. Although depository institutions mainly undertake loan securitization, the insurance industry has also entered into this area. In addition, although all three forms of securitization originated in the real estate lending market, these techniques are currently being applied to loans other than mortgages—for example, credit card loans, auto loans, student loans, and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. The Securities Industry and Financial Market Association, a bond industry trade group representing member and associate securities firms, banks, and government agencies, reported that  $516.9 billion of asset-backed securities and$ 269.9 billion of mortgage-backed securities were issued by U.S. corporations in 2018.

# Pass-Through Security

FIs frequently pool the mortgages and other loans they originate and offer investors an interest in the pool in the form of pass-through certificates or securities. Pass-through mortgage securities "pass through" promised payments by households of principal and interest on pools of mortgages created by financial institutions to secondary market investors (mortgage-backed security bond holders) holding an interest in these pools. We illustrate this process in Figure 25-2. After a financial institution accepts mortgages (step 1 in Figure 25-2), it pools them and sells interests in these pools to pass-through security holders (step 2 in Figure 25-2). Each pass-through mortgage security represents a fractional ownership share in a mortgage pool. Thus, a 1 percent owner of a pass-through mortgage security issue is entitled to a 1 percent share www.sifma.org

of the principal and interest payments made over the life of the mortgages underlying the pool of securities. The originating financial institutions (e.g., bank or mortgage company) or a third-party servicer receives principal and interest payments from the mortgage holder (step 3 in Figure 25-2) and passes these payments (minus a servicing fee) through to the pass-through security holders (step 4).

Although many different types of loans (and other assets) on FIs' balance sheets are currently being securitized as pass-throughs, the original use of this type of securitization is a result of government-sponsored programs to enhance the liquidity of the residential mortgage market. These programs indirectly subsidize the growth of home ownership in the United States. We begin by analyzing the government-sponsored securitization of residential mortgage loans. Three government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises (introduced in Chapter 7) are directly involved in the creation of mortgage-backed pass-through securities. Informally, they are known as Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were particularly hard hit by the subprime mortgage market collapse in the midand late 2000s, as these government-sponsored agencies are deeply involved in the market that securitizes subprime mortgages. The two agencies recorded approximately $9 billion in losses in the last half of 2007 related to the market for subprime mortgage-backed securities. In March 2008, government regulators reduced capital requirements on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to 20 percent from 30 percent in a bid to add liquidity to the troubled mortgage market. Regulators estimated that this reduction, in combination with the release of portfolio caps announced in February 2008, was expected to provide up to $200 billion of immediate liquidity to the mortgage-backed securities market and allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase or guarantee about 2 trillion in mortgages in 2008. Continued losses, however, would constrain the agencies' ability to buy or guarantee mortgages and, in turn, mortgage-backed securities.

These fears and concerns became a reality during the financial crisis. In July 2008, Fannie's and Freddie's share prices fell sharply, resulting in a situation in which market participants refused to extend credit to Fannie and Freddie under any terms. Even though Fannie and Freddie maintained access to the debt markets (albeit at higher-than-usual interest rates), their inability to raise new capital cast doubts on their long-term viability. As a result, the federal government concluded that "the companies cannot continue to operate safely and soundly and fulfill their critical public mission, without significant action" to address their financial weaknesses. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), enacted on July 30, 2008, authorized the government to take over the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). On September 7, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) established a conservatorship for both Fannie and Freddie.

In February 2011, the Obama administration recommended phasing out the GSEs and gradually reducing the government's involvement in the mortgage market. In the proposal, any dismantling of Fannie and Freddie would happen gradually to avoid a shake-up in the mortgage markets. Steps to reduce the government's role in the mortgage market likely would raise borrowing costs for home buyers, adding pressure on the still-fragile U.S. housing markets. Consequently, the implementation of the proposal is likely to take years and be driven by the pace of the housing market's recovery (see Chapter 7).

The Incentives and Mechanics of Pass-Through Security Creation. In order to analyze the securitization process, we trace the mechanics of a mortgage pool securitization to provide insights into the return-risk benefits of this process to the mortgage originating FI, as well as the attractiveness of these securities to investors. Given that more than 7.88 trillion of mortgage-backed securities are outstanding—a large proportion sponsored by GNMA—we analyze the creation of a GNMA pass-through security next.[5]

Suppose that an FI has just originated 1,000 new residential mortgages in its local area. The average size of each mortgage is 100,000. Thus, the total size of the new mortgage pool is:

$$
1, 0 0 0 \times \$ 1 0 0, 0 0 0 = \$ 1 0 0 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

Each mortgage, because of its small size, receives credit risk insurance protection from the FHA. This insurance costs a small fee to the originating FI. In addition, each of these new mortgages has an initial stated maturity of 30 years and a mortgage rate—often called the mortgage coupon—of 9 percent per year. Suppose that the FI originating these loans relies mostly on liabilities such as demand deposits as well as its own capital or equity to finance its assets. Under current capital adequacy requirements, each  $1 of new residential mortgage loans must be backed by some capital. As discussed in Chapter 13, regular 1to 4-family residential mortgages are separated into two risk categories ("category 1 residential mortgage exposures" and "category 2 residential mortgage exposures"). Category 1 residential mortgages include traditional, first-lien, prudently underwritten mortgage loans. Category 2 residential mortgages include junior liens and non-traditional mortgage products. The risk weight assigned to the residential mortgage exposure then depends on the mortgage's loan-to-value ratio. For example, if the loans in the$ 100 million mortgage pool are classified as category 1 mortgages and have a loan-to-value ratio between 60 and 80 percent, they are assigned a risk weight of 50 percent and the risk-based capital requirement is 8 percent (see Chapter 13). Therefore, the FI capital needed to back the 100 million mortgage portfolio is:

$$
\text {C a p i t a l} = \$ 100 \text {m i l l o n} \times 0.5 \times 0.08 = \$ 4 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

We assume that the remaining  $96 million needed to fund the mortgages comes from the issuance of demand deposits. Current regulations require that for every dollar of demand deposits held by the FI, a 10 percent cash reserve has to be held at the Federal Reserve Bank or in the vault (see Chapter 13). Assuming that the FI funds the cash reserves on the asset side of the balance sheet with demand deposits, the bank must issue$ 106.67 million [\ $96 million/(1 - 0.1)] in demand deposits (i.e., \$ 96 million to fund mortgages and \$10.67 million to fund the required cash reserves on these demand deposits). The reserve requirement on demand deposits is essentially an additional tax, over and above the capital requirement, on funding the FI's residential mortgage portfolio. Note that since a 0 percent reserve requirement currently exists on CDs and time deposits, the FI needs to raise fewer funds if it uses CDs to fund its mortgage portfolio.

TABLE 25-2 FI Balance Sheet (in millions of dollars)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Cash reserves</td><td>$ 10.67</td><td>Demand deposits</td><td>$106.67</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term mortgages</td><td>100.00</td><td>Capital</td><td>4.00</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$110.67</td><td></td><td>$110.67</td></tr></table> www.fdic.gov

Given these considerations, the FI's initial postmortgage balance sheet may look like the one in Table 25-2. In addition to the capital and reserve requirement taxes, the FI also must pay an annual insurance premium to the FDIC based on the size of its deposits (see Chapter 13). Assuming a deposit insurance premium of 45 basis points (for a low-quality bank), the fee would be:

$$
\$ 106.67 \text {m i l l o n} \times 0. 0 0 4 5 = \$ 4 8 0, 0 1 5
$$

Although the FI is earning a 9 percent mortgage coupon on its mortgage portfolio, it is facing three levels of regulatory taxes:

1. Capital requirements
2. Reserve requirements
3. FDIC insurance premiums

Thus, one incentive to securitize is to reduce the regulatory "tax" burden on the FI to increase its after-tax return.

In addition to facing regulatory taxes on its residential mortgage portfolio earnings, the FI in Table 25-2 has two risk exposure problems:

1. Interest rate risk exposure. The FI funds the 30-year mortgage portfolio from (short-term) demand deposits. Thus, it has a maturity mismatch (see Chapters 20 and 23). This is true even if the mortgage assets have been funded with short-term CDs, time deposits, or other purchased funds.
2. Liquidity risk exposure. The FI is holding an illiquid asset portfolio of long-term mortgages and no excess reserves. As a result, it is exposed to the type of potential liquidity problems discussed in Chapter 22, including the risk of having to conduct mortgage asset "fire sales" to meet large unexpected demand deposit withdrawals.

One possible solution to these interest rate and liquidity risk problems is to lengthen the FI's on-balance-sheet liabilities by issuing longer-term deposits or other liability claims such as medium-term notes. Another solution is to engage in interest rate swaps to transform the FI's liabilities into those of a long-term, fixed-rate nature (see Chapter 24). These techniques, however, do not resolve the problem of regulatory taxes and the burden they impose on the FI's returns.

In contrast, creating GNMA pass-through securities can largely resolve the interest rate and liquidity risk problems on the one hand and reduce the burden of regulatory taxes on the other. This requires the FI to securitize the 100 million in residential mortgages by issuing GNMA pass-through securities. In our example, the FI can do this since each of the 1,000 underlying mortgages has FHA/VA mortgage insurance, the same stated mortgage maturity of 30 years, and coupons of 9 percent. Therefore, they are eligible for securitization under the GNMA program if the FI is an approved lender (which we assume it is—see Chapter 7).

The steps followed in this securitization process are summarized in Figure 25-3. The FI begins the securitization process by packaging the 100 million in mortgage loans. The packaged mortgage loans are removed from the balance sheet by placing them with a third-party trustee off the balance sheet. This third-party trustee may be another FI of high creditworthiness or a legal trustee. Next, the FI determines that (1) GNMA will guarantee, for a fee, the timing of interest and principal payments on the bonds issued to back the mortgage pool and (2) the FI itself will continue to service the pool of mortgages for a fee,

even after they are placed in trust. Then, GNMA issues pass-through securities backed by the underlying 100 million pool of mortgages. These GNMA securities or pass-through bonds are sold to outside investors in the capital market, and the proceeds (net of any underwriting fees) go to the originating FI.

Prepayment Risk on GNMA Pass-Throughs. Mortgage loan securitization reduces (or removes) the regulatory tax burden, interest rate risk exposure, and liquidity risk exposure that FIs face when they issue mortgages. It does, however, introduce a new risk—so-called prepayment risk—to the pass-through security holder. Following the sale, each mortgagee makes a payment every month to the FI. The FI aggregates these payments and passes the funds through to GNMA bond investors via the trustee net of servicing fee and insurance fee deductions. Most fixed-rate mortgages are fully amortized over the mortgage's life. This means that so long as the mortgagee does not seek to prepay the mortgage early within the 30-year period, either to buy a new house or to refinance the mortgage should interest rates fall, bond holders can expect to receive a constant stream of payments each month analogous to the stream of income on fixed-coupon, fixed-income bonds. In reality, however, mortgagees do not act in such a predictable fashion. For a variety of reasons, they relocate or refinance their mortgages (especially when current mortgage rates are below mortgage coupon rates). This propensity to prepay means that realized coupons/cash flows on pass-through securities can often deviate substantially from the stated or expected coupon flows in a no-prepayment world (see below). This unique

Collateralized mortgage obligations, discussed in the next section, provide a way to reduce this prepayment risk.

Assuming that an FI incurs no fees or underwriting costs in the securitization process, its balance sheet might be similar to the one in Table 25-3 immediately after the securitization has taken place. A dramatic change in the FI's balance sheet exposure has occurred. First,  $100 million cash has replaced$ 100 million illiquid mortgage loans. Second, the maturity mismatch is reduced as long-term mortgages are replaced by cash (a short-term asset). Third, the FI has an enhanced ability to deal with and reduce its regulatory taxes. Specifically, it can reduce its capital, since capital standards require none be held against cash on the balance sheet compared to the residential mortgages in the pool, which require 8 percent capital be held against 50 percent of the face value of the mortgage (i.e., on a $100,000 mortgage, an FI must hold $4,000 (100,000 × 0.5 × 0.08) in capital—see Chapter 13). The FI also reduces its reserve requirement and deposit insurance premiums if it uses part of the cash proceeds from the GNMA sale to pay off or retire demand deposits and downsize its balance sheet.

Of course, keeping an all or highly liquid asset portfolio and/or downsizing is a way to reduce regulatory taxes, but these strategies are hardly likely to enhance an FI's profits. The real logic of securitization is that the FI can use cash proceeds from the mortgage/ GNMA sale to create or originate new mortgages, which in turn can be securitized. In so doing, the FI is acting more as an asset (mortgage) broker than a traditional asset transformer, as we discussed in Chapter 1. The advantage of being an asset broker is that the FI profits from mortgage pool servicing fees plus up-front points and fees from mortgage origination. At the same time, the FI no longer must bear the illiquidity and maturity mismatch risks and regulatory taxes that arise when it acts as an asset transformer and holds mortgages to maturity on its balance sheet. Put more simply, the FI's profitability becomes more fee dependent than interest rate-spread dependent.

Prepayment Risk on Pass-Through Securities. As we discussed earlier, the cash flows on the pass-through directly reflect the interest and principal cash flows on the underlying mortgages minus service and insurance fees. However, over time, mortgage rates change. As coupon rates on new mortgages fall, there is an increased incentive for individuals in the pool to pay off old, high-cost mortgages and refinance at lower rates. However, refinancing involves transaction costs and recontracting costs. As a result, mortgage rates may have to fall by some amount below the current coupon rate before there is a significant increase in prepayment in the pool. This was particularly evident from the early 2000s to the middle of the first decade as new residential mortgage rates fell to their lowest levels in 30 years. Figure 25-4 plots the prepayment frequency of a pool of mortgages in relation to the spread between the current mortgage coupon rate  $(Y)$  and the mortgage coupon rate  $(r)$  in the existing pool. Notice when the current mortgage rate  $(Y)$  is above the rate in the pool  $(Y > r)$ , mortgage prepayments are small, reflecting monthly forced turnover as people have to relocate because of jobs, divorces, marriages, and other considerations. Even when the current mortgage rate falls below  $r$ , those remaining in the mortgage pool do not rush to prepay because up-front refinancing, contracting, and penalty costs are likely to outweigh any present value savings from lower mortgage rates. However, as current mortgage rates continue to fall, the propensity for mortgage holders to prepay increases significantly. Conceptually, mortgage holders have a very valuable call option on the mortgage when this option is in the money. That is, when current mortgage rates fall sufficiently lower so that the present value savings of refinancing outweigh the exercise price (the cost of prepayment penalties and other fees and costs), the mortgage will be called by the mortgage holder.

Figure 25-4 The Prepayment Relationship

Since the FI has sold the mortgage cash flows to GNMA investors and must by law pass through all payments received (minus servicing and guaranty fees), investors' cash flows directly reflect the rate of prepayment. As a result, instead of receiving an equal monthly cash flow,  $PMT$ , as is done under a no-prepayment scenario, the actual cash flows ( $CF$ ) received on these securities by investors fluctuate monthly with the rate of prepayments (see Figure 25-5).

In a no-prepayment world, each month's cash flows are the same:  $PMT_{1} = PMT_{2} = \ldots = PMT_{360}$ . However, in a world with prepayments, each month's realized cash flows from the mortgage pool can differ. In Figure 25-5 we show a rising level of cash flows from month 2 onward peaking in month 60, reflecting the effects of early prepayments by some of the 1,000 mortgagees in the pool. This leaves less outstanding principal and interest to be paid in later years. For example, if 300 mortgagees fully prepay by month 60, only 700 mortgagees will remain in the pool at that date. The effect of prepayments is to lower dramatically the principal and interest cash flows received in the later months of the pool's life. For instance, in Figure 25-5, the cash flow received by GNMA bond holders in month 360 is very small relative to month 60 and even months 1 and 2. This reflects the decline in the pool's outstanding principal. Thus, the pass-through security places on the investor in the mortgage pool a prepayment risk that reflects the uncertainty, in terms of timing, of the cash flows received from his or her investments in the bonds backed by the mortgage pool.

Figure 25-6 The Creation of a CMO

# collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)

A mortgage-backed bond issued in multiple classes or tranches.

# Collateralized Mortgage Obligation

Although pass-throughs are still the primary mechanism for securitization, the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is a second vehicle for securitizing FI assets that is used increasingly. Innovated in 1983 by FHLMC and Credit Suisse First Boston, the CMO is a device for making mortgage-backed securities more attractive to investors. The CMO does this by repackaging the cash flows from mortgages and pass-through securities in a different fashion to attract different types of investors with different degrees of aversion to prepayment risk. A pass-through security gives each investor a pro rata share of any promised and prepaid cash flows on a mortgage pool. The CMO is a multiclass pass-through with a number of different bond holder classes or tranches differentiated by the order in which each class is paid off. Thus, a CMO is a type of derivative security with mortgages as the primary asset. Unlike a pass-through, each bond holder class has a different guaranteed coupon just as a regular T-bond has, but more importantly, the allocation of early cash flows due to mortgage prepayments is such that at any one time, all prepayments go to retire the principal outstanding of only one class of bond holders at a time, leaving the other classes' prepayment protected for a period of time. Thus, a CMO serves as a way to distribute or reduce prepayment risk.

# Creation of CMOs

CMOs can be created either by packaging and securitizing whole mortgage loans or, more frequently, by placing existing pass-throughs in a trust off the balance sheet. The trust or third-party FI holds the GNMA pass-throughs as collateral against issues of new CMO securities. The trust issues these CMOs in three or more different classes. For example, the first CMO that Freddie Mac issued in 1983, secured by 20,000 conventional home mortgages worth $1 billion, had three classes: A, $215 million; B, $350 million; and C, $435 million. We show a three-class or tranche CMO in Figure 25-6.

Class A CMO holders will be the least prepayment protected since after paying any guaranteed coupons to the three classes of bond holders, A, B, and C, all remaining cash flows from the mortgage pool have to be used to repurchase the principal outstanding of class A bond holders. Thus, these bonds have the shortest average life with a minimum of prepayment protection. They are, therefore, of great interest to investors seeking short-duration mortgage-backed assets to reduce the duration of their mortgage-related asset portfolios. In recent years depository institutions have been large buyers of CMO Class A securities.

After Class A bonds have been retired, remaining cash flows (after coupon payments) are used to retire the bonds of Class B. As a result, Class B holders will have higher prepayment protection than Class A and expected durations of five to seven years, depending on the level of interest rates. Pension funds and life insurance companies primarily purchase these bonds, although some depository institutions buy this bond class as well.

Class C holders will have the greatest prepayment protection. Because of their long expected duration, Class C bonds are highly attractive to insurance companies and pension funds seeking long-term duration assets to match their long-term duration liabilities. Indeed, because of their failure to offer prepayment protection, regular GNMA pass-throughs may not be very attractive to these institutions. Class C CMOs, with their high but imperfect degree of prepayment protection, may be of greater interest to the managers of these institutions.

# EXAMPLE 25-1 Calculation of Payments to Three Classes of CMO Bond Holders

Suppose that an investment bank buys a 150 million issue of GNMAs and places them in trust as collateral. It then issues a CMO with the following three classes:

Class A: Annual fixed coupon 7 percent, class size 50 million.

Class B: Annual fixed coupon 8 percent, class size 50 million.

Class C: Annual fixed coupon 9 percent, class size 50 million.

Suppose that in month 1 the promised amortized cash flows (PMT) on the mortgages underlying the GNMA pass-through collateral are  $1 million, but an additional$ 1.5 million cash flow results from early mortgage prepayments. Thus, in the first month, the cash flows available to pay promised coupons to the three classes of bond holders are:

$$
P M T + \text {P r e p a m e n t s} = \$ 1 \text {m i l l o n} + \$ 1. 5 \text {m i l l o n} = \$ 2. 5 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

This cash flow is available to the trustee, who uses it in the following fashion:

1. Coupon payments. Each month the trustee pays the guaranteed coupons to the three classes of bond holders at annualized coupon rates of 7 percent, 8 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. Given the stated principal of $50 million for each class, the Class A (7 percent annual coupon) bond holders receive approximately $291,667 in coupon payments in month 1; the Class B (8 percent annual coupon) bond holders receive approximately $333,333 in month 1; and the Class C (9 percent annual coupon) bond holders receive approximately $375,000 in month 1. Thus, the total promised coupon payments to the three classes amounts to 1,000,000 (equal to PMT, the no-prepayment principal and interest cash flows in the GNMA pool).
2. Principal payments. The trustee has  $2.5 million available to pay as a result of promised mortgage payments plus early prepayments, but the total payment of coupon interest amounts to only$ 1 million. For legal and tax reasons, the remaining $1.5 million must be paid to the CMO bond holders. The unique feature of the CMO is that the trustee pays this remaining $1.5 million to Class A bond holders only. This retires early some of these bond holders' principal outstanding. At the end of month 1, only $48.5 million ($50 million – $1.5 million) of Class A bonds remains outstanding, compared to $50 million of Class B and 50 million of Class C bonds. These payment flows are shown graphically in Figure 25-7.

Suppose that in month 2 the promised amortized cash flows (PMT) on the mortgages underlying the GNMA pass-through collateral are  $991,250, but again an additional$ 1.5 million cash flow results from early mortgage prepayments. Thus, in month 2, the cash flows available to pay promised coupons to the three classes of bond holders are:

$$
\mathrm {P M T} + \text {P r e p a m e n t s} = \ 9 9 1, 2 5 0 + \$ 1. 5 \text {m i l l i o n} = \$ 2, 4 9 1, 2 5 0
$$

1. Coupon payments. The trustee pays the guaranteed coupons to the three classes of bond holders at annualized coupon rates of 7 percent, 8 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. Given the remaining principal of $48.5 million for Class A (7 percent annual coupon) bonds, these bond holders receive approximately $282,917 in coupon payments in month 2. Given Class B and C bonds' stated principal of $50 million, the Class B (8 percent annual coupon) bond holders again receive approximately $333,333 in month 2; and the Class C (9 percent annual coupon) bond holders again receive approximately $375,000 in month 2. Thus, the total promised coupon payments to the three classes amounts to $991,250 (equal to PMT, the no-prepayment principal and interest cash flows in the GNMA pool).
 2. Principal payments. The trustee has $2,491,250 available to pay as a result of promised mortgage payments plus early prepayments. Again, the remaining $1.5 million must be paid to the CMO bond holders. The trustee again pays this remaining $1.5 million to Class A bond holders only. This retires early some of these bond holders' principal outstanding. At the end of month 2, only $47 million ($48.5 million – $1.5 million) of Class A bonds remains outstanding, compared to $50 million of Class B and $50 million of Class C.

This continues until the full amount of the principal of Class A bonds is paid off. Once this happens, any subsequent prepayments go to retire the principal outstanding to Class B bond holders and, after they are paid off, to Class C bond holders.

Clearly, issuing CMOs is often equivalent to engaging in double securitization. An FI packages mortgages and issues a GNMA pass-through. An investment bank such as Goldman Sachs or another CMO issuer such as FHLMC, a commercial bank, or a savings bank may buy this entire issue or a large part of it. Goldman Sachs, for example, then places these GNMA securities as collateral with a trust and issues three new classes of bonds backed by the GNMA securities as collateral. (These trusts are sometimes called real estate mortgage investment conduits, or REMICS, see below.) As a result, the investors in each CMO class have a claim to the GNMA collateral should the issuer fail. The investment bank or other issuer creates the CMO to make a profit by repackaging the cash flows from the single-class GNMA pass-through into cash flows more attractive to different groups of investors. The sum of the prices at which the three CMO bond classes can be sold normally exceeds that of the original pass-through:

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3} P _ {\mathrm {i C M O}} > P _ {\mathrm {G N M A}}
$$

Gains from repackaging come from the way CMOs restructure prepayment risk to make it more attractive to different classes of investors. Specifically, under a CMO, each class has a guaranteed or fixed coupon. By restructuring the GNMA as a CMO, an FI can offer investors who buy bond Class C a high degree of mortgage prepayment protection compared to a pass-through; those who buy Class B receive an average degree of prepayment protection; those who buy Class A have virtually no prepayment protection. Thus, CMOs redistribute prepayment risk among investors.

Figure 25-8 illustrates the typical pattern of outstanding principal balances for a three-tranche (class) CMO over time. With no prepayment, the outstanding principal balance is represented in Figure 25-8 by the curved line  $MN$ . Given any positive flow of prepayments, within a few years, the class A bonds clearly would be fully retired, point  $X$  in Figure 25-8. In practice, this often occurs one and a half to three years after issue. After the trustee retires Class A, only Classes B and C remain. As the months pass, the trustee uses any excess cash flows over and above the promised coupon payments to Class B bond holders to retire bond class B's principal. Eventually, all of the principal on Class B bonds is retired (point  $Y$  in Figure 25-8)—in practice, five to seven years after CMO issue. After Class B bonds are retired, all remaining cash flows are dedicated to paying the promised coupon of Class C bond holders and retiring the full amount of principal on Class C bonds (point  $Z$  in Figure 25-8). In practice, Class C bonds can have an average life of as long as 20 years.

Figure 25-8 Pattern of Principal Balances Outstanding for Three-Class CMO

CMOs can always have more than the three classes described earlier. Indeed, issues of up to 17 different classes have been made. Clearly, the 17th-class bond holders would have an enormous degree of prepayment protection, since the first 16 classes would have had their bonds retired before the principal outstanding on this bond class would be affected by early prepayments. In addition, trustees have created other special types of classes as products to attract investor interest. Frequently, CMO issues contain a Z class as the last regular class. The Z implicitly stands for zero, but these are not really zero-coupon bonds. This class has a stated coupon such as 10 percent and accrues interest for the bond holder on a monthly basis at this rate. The trustee does not pay this interest, however, until all other classes of bonds are fully retired. When the other classes have been retired, the Z class bond holder receives the promised coupon and principal payments plus accrued interest payments. Thus, the Z class has characteristics of both a zero-coupon bond (no coupon payments for a long period) and a regular bond.

Another type of CMO class that is partially protected from prepayment risk is a planned amortization class, or PAC. A PAC is designed to produce constant cash flows within a range (or band) of prepayment rates. The greater predictability of the cash flows on these classes of bonds occurs because they must satisfy a principal repayment schedule, compared to other CMO classes in which principal repayment might or might not occur. PAC bond holders have priority over all other classes in the CMO issue in receiving principal payments from the underlying mortgages. Thus, the greater certainty of the cash flows for the PAC bonds comes at the expense of the non-PAC bonds, called support bonds, which absorb the prepayment risk. Just as sequential bonds were created to allow investors to specify maturity ranges for their investments, PACs can be divided sequentially to provide more narrow paydown structures. Although PAC bonds are somewhat protected from prepayment risk, they are not completely risk-free. If prepayments are fast enough or slow enough, the cash flows of the PAC bonds will change.[7]

One drawback of CMOs is that originators may not be able to pass through all interest payments on a tax-free basis when they issue multiple debt securities. This creates a tax problem for various originators. A provision of the 1986 Tax Reform Act authorized the creation of a new type of mortgage-backed security called a REMIC (real estate mortgage investment conduit). A REMIC allows for the pass-through of all interest and principal payments before taxes are levied. Today, most CMOs are created as REMICs because of this tax advantage.

As noted, CMOs are attractive to secondary mortgage market investors because they can choose a particular CMO class that fits their maturity needs. While there is no guarantee that the CMO securities will actually mature in exact accordance with the horizon desired by the investor, the CMO significantly increases the probability of receiving cash flows over a specified horizon. For example, a third-class CMO holder knows that he or she will not be paid off until all firstand second-class holders are paid in full.

# Mortgage-Backed Bond

# mortgage- (asset-) backed bonds (MBBs)

Bonds collateralized by a pool of assets.

As discussed in Chapter 7, mortgage- (asset-) backed bonds (MBBs) differ from pass-throughs and CMOs in two key dimensions. First, while pass-throughs and CMOs help FIs remove mortgages from their balance sheets, mortgages backing MBBs normally remain on the balance sheet. Second, pass-throughs and CMOs have a direct link between the cash flows on the underlying mortgages and the cash flows on the bond instrument issued. In contrast, the relationship for MBBs is one of collateralization—the cash flows on the mortgages backing the bond are not necessarily directly connected to interest and principal payments on the MBB. Thus, a MBB is also a type of derivative with mortgages as the primary security.

An FI issues an MBB to reduce risk to the MBB holders, who have a first claim to a segment of the FI's mortgage assets. The FI segregates a group of mortgage assets on its balance sheet and pledges this group of assets as collateral against the MBB issue. A trustee normally monitors the segregation of assets and ensures that the market value of the collateral exceeds the principal owed to MBB holders. That is, FIs back most MBB issues by excess collateral. This excess collateral backing of the bond, in addition to the priority rights of the bond holders, generally ensures the sale of these bonds with a high investment grade credit rating. In contrast, the FI, when evaluated as a whole, could be rated as BB or even lower. A high credit rating results in lower coupon payments than would be required if significant default risk had lowered the credit rating. To explain the potential benefits and the sources of any gains to an FI from issuing MBBs, we examine the following simple example.

# EXAMPLE 25-2 Gains to an FI from Issuing MBBs

Consider an FI with  $20 million in long-term mortgages as assets. It is financing these mortgages with$ 10 million in short-term uninsured deposits (e.g., wholesale deposits over $250,000) and $10 million in insured deposits (e.g., retail deposits of 250,000 or less). In this example, we ignore the issues of capital and reserve requirements. Look at the balance sheet structure shown in Table 25-4.

This balance sheet poses problems for the FI manager. First, the FI has significant interest rate risk exposure due to the mismatch of the maturities of its assets and liabilities. Second, because of this interest rate risk and the potential default and prepayment risk on the FI's mortgage assets, uninsured depositors are likely to require a positive and potentially significant risk premium to be paid on their deposits. By contrast, the insured depositors may require approximately the risk-free rate on their deposits because they are fully insured by the FDIC (see Chapter 22).

To reduce its interest rate risk exposure and to lower its funding costs, the FI can segregate 12 million of the mortgages on the asset side of its balance sheet and pledge them as collateral backing a  $10 million long-term MBB issue. Because the$ 10 million in MBBs is backed by mortgages worth $12 million, the mortgage-backed bond issued by the FI may cost less to issue, in terms of required yield, than uninsured deposit rates currently being paid—it may well be rated AA, while uninsured deposits might be rated BB. The FI can then use the proceeds of the $10 million bond issue to replace the 10 million of uninsured deposits.

Consider the FI's balance sheet after the issue of the MBBs (Table 25-5). It might seem that the FI has miraculously engineered a restructuring of its balance sheet that has resulted in a better match of the maturities of its assets and liabilities and a decrease in funding costs. The bond issue has lengthened the average maturity of liabilities by replacing short-term wholesale deposits with long-term MBBs and has lowered funding costs because AA rated bond coupon rates are below BB rated uninsured deposit rates. This outcome, however, occurs only because the insured depositors do not worry about risk exposure since they are 100 percent insured by the FDIC. The result of the MBB issue and the segregation of  $12 million of assets as collateral backing the$ 10 million bond issue is that the insured deposits of $10 million are now backed by only $8 million in free or unpledged assets. If smaller depositors were not insured by the FDIC, they would surely demand very high risk premiums for holding these risky deposits. The implication of this is that the FI gains only because the FDIC is willing to bear enhanced credit risk through its insurance guarantees to depositors. As a result, the FI is actually gaining at the expense of the FDIC. Consequently, it is not surprising that the FDIC is concerned about the growing use of this form of securitization by risky banks and thrifts.

MBB issuance also has a number of costs. First, MBBs tie up mortgages on the FI's balance sheet for a long time, thus decreasing the asset portfolio's liquidity. Further, the balance sheet becomes more illiquid due to the need to overcollateralize MBBs to ensure a high-quality credit risk rating for the issue; in our example, the overcollateralization was 2 million. Second, the MBB issuer (the FI) is subject to any prepayment risk on the mortgages underlying the MBB. Third, the FI continues to be liable for capital adequacy and reserve requirement taxes by keeping the mortgages on the balance sheet. Because of these costs, MBBs are the least used of the three basic vehicles of securitization.

# SECURITIZATION OF OTHER ASSETS

The major use of the three securitization vehicles—pass-throughs, CMOs, and mortgage-backed bonds—has been to package fixed-rate residential mortgage assets. The standard features on mortgages have made the packaging and securitization of these securities relatively easy. But these techniques can and have been used for other assets, including the following:

Automobile loans

Credit card receivables

- Small-business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration
- Commercial and industrial loans
Student loans
CDOs/Close
Equipment loans
Junk bonds
- Adjustable rate mortgages

At the end of 2018, securitized automobile loans totaled  $222.8 billion, credit card receivables totaled$ 123.8 billion, student loans totaled $170.9 billion, equipment loans totaled $84.3 billion, and CDOs/Close totaled 808.3 billion (Figure 25-9).

# CAN ALL ASSETS BE SECURITIZED?

# LG 25-5

The extension of securitization technology to assets other than fixed-rate residential mortgages raises questions about the limits of securitization and whether all assets and loans can eventually be securitized. Conceptually, the answer is that they can, so long as doing so is profitable or the benefits to the FI from securitization outweigh its costs. With heterogeneous loans, it is important to standardize the salient features of loans. Default risks, if significant, have to be reduced by diversification. Expected maturities have to be reasonably similar. As mechanisms are developed to overcome these difficulties, it is perfectly reasonable to expect securitization to grow. Table 25-6 summarizes the overall benefits versus the costs of securitization.

From Table 25-6, given any set of benefits, the more costly and difficult it is to find asset packages of sufficient size and homogeneity, the more difficult and expensive it is to securitize. For example, C&I loans have maturities running from a few months to eight years or more. Further, they have varying interest rate terms (fixed, LIBOR floating, federal funds rate floating) and fees. In addition, C&I loans contain different contractual covenants (covering items such as dividend payments by firms) and are made to firms in a wide variety of industries. Despite this, FIs have still been able to issue securitization packages called Close (collateralized loan obligations containing high-quality, low-default risk loans) and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations containing a diversified collection of junk bonds or risky bank loans). The interest and principal payments on a CDO are linked to the timing of default losses and repayments on a pool of underlying loans or bonds. A synthetic CDO is a type of CDO in which the underlying credit exposures are credit default swaps (CDSs) rather than a pool of loans or bonds. Thus, the periodic payments are linked to the cash flows from the credit default swaps. If the credit event occurs in the underlying portfolio, the synthetic CDO (and any investors) become responsible for the losses. Synthetic CDOs are securitized securities that can offer extremely high returns to investors. However, investors can lose more than their initial investments if several credit events occur in the underlying portfolio. The riskiest of the CDOs, sometimes called "toxic waste," pay out only if everything goes right.

The best CDOs will pay out unless the entire portfolio defaults. Generally, it has been much harder to securitize low-quality loans into CDOs. Specifically, the harder it is to value a loan or asset pool, the greater the costs of securitization due to the need for overcollateralization or credit risk insurance. The major sellers of CDOs are commercial and investment banks, through their SIVs or SPVs (see Chapter 13). The major buyers are hedge funds, commercial banks, investment banks, and pension funds. While the banks that create and sell the CDOs distribute the cash flows from the underlying assets to the CDO buyers, the valuation of these credit derivatives is not based solely on the estimated cash flows from underlying assets. Rather, the valuation of CDOs involves the use of metrics and algorithms developed by traders and mathematicians.

TABLE 25-6 Benefits versus Costs of Securitization

<table><tr><td>Benefits</td><td>Costs</td></tr><tr><td>1. New funding source (bonds versus deposits).</td><td>1. Public/private credit risk insurance and guarantees.</td></tr><tr><td>2. Increased liquidity of bank loans.</td><td>2. Overcollateralization.</td></tr><tr><td>3. Enhanced ability to manage the duration gap and thus interest rate risk.</td><td>3. Valuation and packaging (the cost of asset heterogeneity).</td></tr><tr><td>4. A savings to the issuer (if off balance sheet) on reserve requirements, deposit insurance premiums, and capital adequacy requirements.</td><td></td></tr></table>

Of all of the instruments that caused damage to FIs and the world's financial markets in general during the financial crisis, the most damaging one was arguably the CDO backed by subprime debt. Many FIs had invested heavily in these CDOs. The size of CDO market grew from  $2.5 billion in 1995 to$ 1,056.9 billion in 2007 right before the financial crisis. As discussed below, CDOs were at the very heart of the financial crisis, and this market decreased in size significantly as a result to $598.7 billion in 2013. By 2018, this market recovered significantly with $808.3 billion outstanding (Figure 25-9). Cash flow CDOs have as their underlying collateral real securities, such as bonds, CDO tranches, and asset-backed securities tranches. The most naive investors simply looked at the ratings on these CDO tranches and then bought the tranche if they liked the rating. They did not attempt or did not have the models to confirm if the price they were asked to pay was a fair value. Other investors accepted what CDO arrangers and the ratings agencies recommended for valuation technology. However, these models consistently underestimated the worst-case scenario and overvalued CDO tranches. The best practice in valuing cash flow CDOs is to simulate the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the CDO tranches, loan by loan, and then simulate the losses and cash flows of the CDO tranches in the CDO structure. Most investors until recently have done no analysis—because they did not have such software capabilities at their disposal. As a result, they consistently overpaid for cash flow CDO tranches and they took on risk that they did not understand.

Within the CDO market, CLO issuance is far surpassing other types of asset-backed securities. In 2007, Close were 27 percent of CDOs outstanding. As of December 2018, Close represent 76 percent of all CDOs, according to SIFMA. With the Federal Reserve hiking rates nine times from December 2015 through December 2018, money managers have piled into leveraged loans via collateralized loan obligations (Close). That demand has helped lift the size of the U.S. leveraged-loan market to around  $1.3 trillion, overtaking the high-yield bond market (interestingly,$ 1.3 trillion is also equivalent in size to the U.S. subprime mortgage market in March 2007). As demand outstripped supply, investors agreed to weaker safeguards and protections on loans to junk-rated companies, according to Moody's Investors Service. Almost 85 percent of leveraged loans are "covenant-lite," meaning they lack meaningful protections against significant losses. In the 2006-2007 period, that proportion was less than 25 percent. In addition, Moody's indicated that the rating profile of the leveraged loan universe has declined. In particular, the proportion of leveraged loans rated B2 or lower was at 64 percent in 2018 compared to 47 percent in 2006. Despite these negative trends, Close have continued to purchase about 60 percent of syndicated leveraged loan volumes, according to S&P Global.

The potential boundary to securitization may well be defined by the relative degree of heterogeneity and the credit quality of an asset type or group. It is not surprising that 30-year, fixed-rate residential mortgages were the first assets to be securitized since they are the most homogeneous of all assets in FI balance sheets. For example, the existence of secondary markets for houses provides price information that allows reasonably accurate market valuations of the underlying asset and extensive data are available on mortgage default rates by locality.

# SUMMARY

This chapter discussed the increasing role of loan sales in addition to the legal and regulatory factors that are likely to affect the future growth of this market. The chapter also discussed three major forms of securitization—pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and mortgage-backed bonds (MBBs)—and described recent innovations in the securitization of other FI assets. Loan sales provide a simple alternative to the full securitization of loans through bond packages. In particular, they provide a valuable tool to an FI that wishes to manage its credit risk exposure better. Recently, by increasingly relying on securitization, banks and thrifts have begun to move away from being asset transformers and toward becoming asset brokers. Thus, over time we have seen the traditional differences between commercial banking and investment banking diminish as more and more loans and assets are securitized.
