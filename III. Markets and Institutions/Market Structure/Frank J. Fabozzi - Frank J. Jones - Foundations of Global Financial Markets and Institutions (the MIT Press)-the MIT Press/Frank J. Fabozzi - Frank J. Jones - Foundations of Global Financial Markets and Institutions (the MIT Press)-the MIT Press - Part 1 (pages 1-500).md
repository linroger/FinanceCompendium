Preface

```

The first edition of this book, published in 1994, was written by Frank

Fabozzi and Franco Modigliani, the 1985 recipient of the Nobel Memorial

Prize in Economic Sciences. In the Preface to the first edition, they wrote

that the prior 30 years had been a time of profound, indeed revolutionary,

change in the financial markets and institutions of the world. The hallmarks

- f that change were innovation, globalization, and deregulation. Since 1994,
those forces have actually gathered more strength, and the financial
landscape continues to undergo large and visible changes around the globe.
Their purpose in writing the book was to instruct students about this
fascinating revolution. They described the wide array of financial
instruments that are now available for investing, funding operations, and
controlling the wide range of financial risks. Each type of financial
instrument was shown to be a response to the needs of borrowers, lenders,
and investors, who manage assets and liabilities in a world of constantly
changing interest rates, asset prices, regulatory constraints, and international
competition and opportunities. The book devoted a considerable amount of
space to explaining how the world's key financial institutions manage their
assets and liabilities and how innovative financial instruments support that
management. The focus on the actual practices of financial institutions was
particularly beneficial to students who will inevitably have to respond to
changes in those institutions and their environment.

This is the fifth edition of the book. The fourth edition was published in

2009. Given the significant changes in various aspects of the global

financial markets, this edition is a substantial revision of the fourth edition.

The table on pages xix–xxi compares the fourth edition to this new edition.

The overriding emphasis when revising the book was to make it more

global centric—hence the addition of the word "Global" in the book's new

title. Consequently, the U.S. financial market is still covered in considerable

detail, but we describe non-U.S. financial markets as well. For practical

reasons, it is not possible for us to include a detailed discussion of every

country's financial market. Instead, we show how the financial markets of

- ther countries may be similar to or differ significantly from that of the U.S.
market.

```
Overview of the Book

```

The emphasis on topic coverage is best explained by providing an overview

- f the book and how the current edition differs from the previous edition
(the fourth edition). The book is divided into eight parts. Every chapter
concludes with key points that are in bullet format so that the student can
quickly review the concepts and principles covered in the chapter.

```
Part I: Financial Markets and Players

```

In this nine-chapter part, chapter 1 provides an introduction to financial

markets, the attributes of financial assets, and the link between financial

markets and the real economy. Chapter 2 (a new chapter) explains the role

- f governments in financial markets. Trying to understand the attributes of
financial instruments without a thorough understanding of those who
participate (the "players") in the financial market makes little sense.
Understanding why private market participants actively buy certain types of
financial instruments and avoid other types requires becoming familiar with
the investment objectives of a wide range of investor types, as well as with
any regulatory constraints that might be imposed. Chapter 3 covers the
special role of financial entities called "financial intermediaries" and asset
management firms. In chapter 4 (a new chapter), we provide an overview of
private market participants. A key player in the financial market that we
believe deserves its own chapter is the credit rating agencies, the subject of
chapter 5 (a new chapter). Chapter 6 focuses on depository institutions,
followed in chapter 7 (a new chapter) by the role of central banks.
Insurance companies and the wide range of activities of investment banking
firms are the subjects of chapters 8 and 9, respectively.

```
Part II: Understanding Risks and Asset Pricing

```

The five chapters in part II cover the risks that investors and issuers are

exposed to when participating in financial markets and the implications for

the pricing of assets. One of the objectives in the study of finance is to

understand the trade-off between risk and return. The term "risk" carries

many meanings in finance, depending on the context in which it is used.

Rather than leave the concept of risk vague and describe its meaning in

different contexts as they arise throughout the book, in chapter 10—a new

chapter to this edition of the book—we provide an overview of risk. The

chapter covers the difference between risk and uncertainty, the key elements

- f financial risk management and the identification of financial risks, the
various types of investment risk faced by investors, and the various types of
funding risk faced by entities seeking to raise capital.

The major topics in the balance of part II cover the properties and

general principles in the pricing of financial assets (chapter 11), asset return

distributions and the quantification of some risk measures (chapter 12), the

selection of assets to include in a portfolio (chapter 13, a new chapter), and

the theory of how assets are priced (chapter 14). These are the major

theories in finance, and there is considerable debate as to whether these

theories correctly describe the way investors should construct an investment

portfolio (i.e., portfolio theory) and how assets should be priced (i.e., asset

pricing theory).

Chapter 12, which describes return distributions and risk measures, is a

new chapter to this book. The four principal topics covered in the chapter

are the different types of distributions that financial asset returns can follow,

different measures of dependence between asset returns, attributes of

portfolio risk measures, and alternative ratios of reward to risk. This chapter

precedes the chapters on portfolio theory and asset pricing, because the

material presented is necessary to understand those theories and (just as

important) the limitations of those theories. Although the topics draw on

basic concepts in statistics, the coverage is at an elementary level. There are

three important takeaways from chapter 12. The first is that substantial

empirical evidence from real-world markets indicates that return

distributions for financial assets do not follow the normal distribution, as

assumed in much of finance theory. In fact, some market commentators

believe that the failure of many financial models reported during the Great

Recession of 2008–2009 is the result of relying on the assumption that

returns follow a normal distribution, the principal distribution covered in

introductory probability and statistics courses. The second takeaway is that

a measure of dependence between financial asset returns as assumed in

traditional portfolio theory, the covariance or correlation, is just one

measure of dependence. For the purpose of both portfolio management and

risk management, better measures can be employed. Finally, the measure of

portfolio risk used in traditional finance theory is the variance or standard

deviation. Other measures that offer a better means for capturing risk are

available, and these measures affect the reward/risk ratios that should be

used by investors when constructing portfolios.

```
Part III: Interest Rates, Interest Rate Risk, and Credit Risk

```

The structure of interest rates and interest rate and credit risks are the

subjects of part III. Chapter 15, the first of two chapters in part III, focuses

- n the classical theory of interest rates, which, it is assumed, provides the
anchor for all interest rates in an economy.

The classical theory of interest rates provides insight into what factors

determine the level of interest rates in an economy. However, there is not a

single interest rate. Rather there is a structure of interest rates. In chapter

16, we look closely at the structure of interest rates. We will see that there

are a myriad of factors influencing the interest rates that investors seek on

alternative investment products. These factors include the type of issuer, the

characteristics of the debt obligation, and the state of the economy. The

concepts introduced at the beginning of chapter 16 are used to demonstrate

how debt obligations should be priced in the market, as well as how to

determine the calculation of a bond's yield. In the last section of chapter 16,

we explain the relationship between the yield on a debt instrument and its

maturity, which is referred to as the "term structure of interest rates." The

different economic theories that have been offered to explain the term

structure of interest rates are described.

```
Part IV: Primary and Secondary Markets

```

The three chapters in part IV first cover the fundamentals of primary

markets (chapter 17) and secondary markets (chapter 18). The

characteristics of these markets and their regulation are covered in these

two chapters. The chapters begin by discussing regulations in the U.S.

market and then move on to regulation in other developed countries. The

last of the three chapters, chapter 19, covers the foreign exchange market.

Chapter 19 is a new chapter in the book. In the previous edition, this topic

was covered in the chapter on foreign exchange derivatives.

```
Part V: Global Government Debt Markets

```

In the previous edition of the book, two chapters covered the government

debt market: one on the U.S. Treasury market and the other on the

municipal securities market. In this edition, the U.S. Treasury market is

covered in chapter 20, but that chapter has been expanded to include nonU.S. sovereign debt markets. The U.S. municipal securities market is

described in chapter 21. That chapter also covers subnational government

debt markets and the importance of the development of that market for

infrastructure financing in both developed and developing markets. Given

the substantial expansion of the coverage in these chapters, they are

basically new chapters.

```
Part VI: Corporate Funding Markets

```

The seven chapters covered in part VI describe the various financial

markets that corporations and other business entities use to obtain funding.

The first three chapters (chapters 22, 23, and 24) focus on equity markets.

Chapter 22 describes the structure and trading venues of the U.S. equity

market, and chapter 23 covers strategies that are used by investors in this

market and the important topic of pricing efficiency. Non-U.S. equity

markets, with emphasis on the relatively new and large Chinese market, are

covered in chapter 24, a new addition to the book. The debt markets

available to corporation and other business entities are covered in chapters

25–28. The global short-term funding market (more popularly referred to as

the "global money market") is the subject of chapter 25; the intermediateto long-term corporate notes and bonds are the subject of chapter 26.

Securitization is a tool for the creation of a corporate debt instrument

backed by a pool of corporate-related assets, such as receivables and future

revenue. Often one thinks of securitization being used for the creation of

mortgage-backed securities that we discuss in the next part of the book.

However, corporations use securitization for a variety of reasons, such as

reducing funding costs and managing risk. The securitization process and

the parties to a securitization are described in chapter 27.

A new addition to the book is the financial market for small and

medium-sized enterprises and new entrepreneurial ventures, with emphasis

- n start-ups and venture capital. This coverage is in chapter 28, where the
various types of financial instruments available to such entities—as well as
the regulations pertaining to the issuance of those financial instruments—
are discussed.

```
Part VII: Real Estate Markets

```

Real estate can be classified as either residential properties or commercial

properties. Residential real estate includes oneto four-family properties.

Chapter 29 describes the residential mortgage market where homeowners

- btain funding to purchase a home and the types of mortgage loans. The
pooling of residential mortgage loans to create a residential mortgagebacked security is the subject of chapter 30. In that chapter, agency
residential mortgage-backed securities and residential private-label
mortgage-backed securities are described. Also described in that chapter are
mortgage derivative securities: collateralized mortgage obligations and
stripped mortgage-backed securities.

Commercial real estate is income-producing properties and is the subject

- f chapter 31. The major commercial property types are multifamily
housing, apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial properties
(including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, health care facilities (e.g.,
senior housing care facilities), and timberlands. Commercial real estate
investments are classified as follows: private commercial real estate equity,
public commercial real estate equity, private commercial real estate debt,
and public commercial real estate debt. Each type is described in the
chapter.

```
Part VIII: Collective Investment Vehicles and Financial

Derivatives Markets

```

This last part of the book has eight chapters and begins with a description of

collective investment vehicles (chapter 32), which is a new addition to the

book. Collective investment vehicles are products that are managed by asset

management firms. These investment vehicles involve the pooling of funds

by asset management firms and the investment of those funds in certain

financial assets. The major collective investment vehicles covered in this

chapter are investment company shares (i.e., mutual funds/open-end funds

and closed-end funds), exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, real estate

investment trusts, and venture capital funds.

The seven remaining chapters focus on various types of financial

derivatives, or simply, "derivatives." Chapters 33 and 34 describe financial

futures and options, respectively. The pricing and applications of futures

and options are the subjects of chapters 35 and 36, respectively. The various

types of interest rate derivatives traded in the over-the-counter market

(forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps, and floors) are

described in chapter 37. Foreign-exchange derivative markets are covered

in chapter 38, and the market for credit risk transfer vehicles (the most

important being credit default swaps) is the subject of the last chapter in the

book, chapter 39.

In a market economy, the allocation of economic resources is the outcome

- f many private decisions. Prices are the signals operating in a market
economy that direct economic resources to their best use. The types of
markets in an economy can be divided into (1) the markets for products
(manufactured goods and services), called the **product markets**, and (2) the
market for the factors of production (labor and capital), called the **factor**

**markets** .

Our purpose in this book is to focus on one part of the factor markets,

the market for financial assets, or more simply, the **financial market** . The

financial market is one of the three major components of the **financial**

**system** . The other two components are financial institutions and financial

market infrastructure. **Financial institutions** are the entities that provide

financial services to other entities in the financial system. They include

depository institutions (e.g., banks), insurance companies, and securities

firms. **Financial market infrastructure** is the component of the financial

system that involves processing the payments of financial assets.

In this chapter, we will look at the role of financial markets, the "things"

that are traded (i.e., bought and sold) in financial markets, the reasons for

the integration of world financial markets, and the government's role in the

regulation of these markets. Chapters that follow deal with the key financial

institutions, and the financial market infrastructure will be discussed when

we describe the different sectors of the financial market.

```
Financial Assets

```

We begin with a few basic definitions. An **asset**, broadly speaking, is any

possession that has value in an exchange. Assets can be classified as

tangible or intangible. A **tangible asset** is one whose value depends on

particular physical properties—examples are buildings, land, or machinery.

**Intangible assets**, by contrast, represent legal claims to some future benefit.

Their value bears no relation to the form, physical or otherwise, in which

these claims are recorded.

Financial assets are intangible assets. For financial assets, the typical

benefit or value is a claim to future cash. With one exception (real estate,

which is a tangible asset), this book deals with the various types of financial

assets, the markets where they are traded, and the principles for valuing

them. Throughout this book, we use the terms "financial asset," **financial**

**instrument**, and **security** interchangeably.

The entity that has agreed to make future cash payments is called the

**issuer** - f the financial asset; the owner of the financial asset is referred to as

the **investor** . Here are just seven examples of financial assets:

a loan by Bank of America (investor) to an individual

(issuer/borrower) to purchase a car

a bond issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury

a bond issued by AT&T

a bond issued by the City of New York

a bond issued by the German government

a share of common stock issued by Apple Inc.

a share of common stock issued by Honda Motor Company, a Japanese

automotive company

In the case of the car loan, the terms of the loan establish that over time,

the borrower must make specified payments to the Bank of America. The

payments include repayment of the amount borrowed plus interest. The

cash flow for this asset is made up of the specified payments that the

borrower must make.

In the case of a U.S. Treasury bond, the U.S. government (the issuer)

agrees to pay the investor the bond interest payments every six months until

the bond matures, and then at the maturity date, repay the amount

borrowed. The same is true for the bonds issued by AT&T, the City of New

York, and the German government. In the case of AT&T, the issuer is a

corporation, not a government entity. In the case of the City of New York,

the issuer is a municipal government. The issuer of the German government

bond is a central government entity.

The common stock of Apple Inc. entitles the investor to receive

dividends distributed by the company. In this case, the investor also has a

claim to a pro rata share of the net asset value of the company in the case of

the company's liquidation in a bankruptcy. The same is true of the common

stock of Honda Motor Company.

```
Debt versus Equity Instruments

```

The claim that the holder of a financial asset has may be either a fixed

amount or a varying, or residual, amount. In the former case, the financial

asset is referred to as a **debt instrument** . The car loan, the U.S. Treasury

bond, the AT&T bond, the City of New York bond, and the German

government bond cited above are examples of debt instruments requiring

fixed payments.

An **equity instrument** (also called a **residual claim** ) obligates the issuer

- f the financial asset to pay the holder an amount based on earnings, if
approved by the board of directors, after holders of debt instruments have
been paid. Common stock is an example of an equity instrument. A
partnership share in a business is another example.

Some securities fall into both categories. For example, **preferred stock**

is an equity instrument, issued in the United States but not all countries,

which entitles the investor to receive a fixed amount. This payment is

contingent, however, and due only after payments to debt instrument

holders are made.

Another "combination" instrument is a convertible bond, which allows

the investor to convert debt into equity under certain circumstances. Both

**fixed-income instruments** .
debt and preferred stock are called

Certain types of financial instruments may seem odd at first. For

example, there are bonds issued by life insurance companies where

payments are made based on mortality rates or bonds issued by a mining

company where the payments are based on the price of the natural resource

being mined. Once you understand the needs of issuers and the risk/return

relationships in financial markets to compensate investors for taking on

certain risks, what may at first appear to be an odd or unusual financial

instrument will make economic sense. Indeed, the purpose of this book is to

help you understand the global financial markets and the players in the

markets, so that you can understand why every type of financial instrument

traded in the market fulfills the needs of issuers, investors, or both.

```
The Price of a Financial Asset and Risk

```

A basic economic principle is that the price of any financial asset is equal to

the present value of its expected cash flow, even if the cash flow is not

known with certainty. By **cash flow**, we mean the stream of cash payments

- ver time. For example, if a U.S. government bond promises to pay \$20
every six months for the next 30 years and \$1,000 at the end of 30 years,
then this is the bond's cash flow. In the case of the car loan by Bank of
America, if the borrower is obligated to pay \$500 every month for three
years, then this is the cash flow of the loan. We elaborate on this principle

throughout this book as we discuss several theories for the pricing of

financial assets.

Directly related to the notion of price is the expected return on a

financial asset. Given the expected cash flow of a financial asset and its

price, we can determine its expected rate of return. For example, if the price

- f a financial asset is \$100, and its only cash flow is \$105 one year from
now, then its expected return would be 5%.

The type of financial asset, whether debt instrument or equity

instrument, as well as the characteristics of the issuer, determine the degree

- f certainty of the expected cash flow. For example, assuming that the U.S.
government is not expected to default on the debt instruments it issues, the
cash flow of U.S. Treasury securities is known with certainty. What is
uncertain, however, is the purchasing power of the cash flow received.

In the case of the Bank of America car loan, the ability of the borrower

to repay presents some uncertainty about the cash flow. But, if the borrower

does not default on the loan obligation, the investor (Bank of America)

knows what the cash flow will be. The same is true for the bonds of AT&T

and the City of New York. In the case of the German government bond, the

cash flow is known if the government of Germany does not default.

However, the cash flow may be denominated not in U.S. dollars but in the

German currency, the euro. Thus, although the cash flow is known in terms

- f the number of euros that will be received, from the perspective of a U.S.
investor, the number of U.S. dollars is unknown. The number of U.S.
dollars will depend on the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S.
dollar at the time the cash flow is received.

The holder of Apple common stock is uncertain as to both the amount

and the timing of dividend payments. Dividend payments will be related to

company profits. The same is true for the cash flow of the common stock of

Honda Motor Company. In addition, because Honda will make dividend

payments in Japanese yen, there is uncertainty about the cash flow in terms

- f U.S. dollars.

We explain various types of risk in chapter 10, as well as in other

chapters throughout this book, but we can see three of these risks in our

examples in this chapter. The first is the risk attached to the potential

purchasing power of the expected cash flow. This is called **purchasing**

**power risk** - r **inflation risk** . The second is the risk that the issuer or

borrower will default on the obligation. This is called **credit risk**, or more

specifically, as explained in chapter 10, **default risk** . Finally, for financial

assets whose cash flow is not denominated in U.S. dollars, there is the risk

that the exchange rate will change adversely, resulting in fewer U.S. dollars.

This risk is referred to as - r .

**foreign-exchange risk** **currency risk**

```
Financial Assets versus Tangible Assets

```

A tangible asset, such as plant or equipment purchased by a business entity,

shares at least one characteristic with a financial asset: Both are expected to

generate future cash flow for their owner. For example, suppose a U.S.

airline purchases a fleet of aircraft for \$500 million. With its purchase of the

aircraft, the airline expects to realize cash flow from passenger travel.

Financial assets and tangible assets are linked. Ownership of tangible

assets is financed by the issuance of some type of financial asset—either

debt instruments or equity instruments. For example, in the case of the

airline, suppose that a debt instrument is issued to raise the \$500 million to

purchase the fleet of aircraft. The cash flow from passenger travel will be

used to service the payments on the debt instrument. Ultimately, therefore,

the cash flow for a financial asset is generated by some tangible asset.

```
The Role of Financial Assets

```

Financial assets have two principal economic functions. The first is to

transfer funds from those who have surplus funds to invest to those who

need funds to invest in tangible assets. The second economic function is to

transfer funds in such a way as to redistribute the unavoidable risk

associated with the cash flow generated by tangible assets among those

seeking and those providing the funds. However, as we will see, the claims

held by the final wealth holders are generally different from the liabilities

issued by the final demanders of funds because of the activity of financial

intermediaries that seek to transform the final liabilities into the financial

assets that the public prefers.

We can illustrate these two economic functions with three examples:

1. Richie Calbo has obtained a license to manufacture wristwatches

with the logo for the U.S. Navy. He estimates that he will need \$1.2

million to purchase plant and equipment to manufacture the watches.

Unfortunately, he has only \$300,000 to invest, and that is his life

savings, which he does not want to invest, even though he has

confidence that there will be a receptive market for the watches.

2. Amanda Santigo, an entrepreneur, has recently invented a product
for the inexpensive and rapid processing of DNA samples for forensic
science labs and has sold the rights for an amount that netted her \$1
million after taxes. She plans to spend \$150,000 to purchase a
condominium, \$50,000 on a car, and to invest the balance, \$800,000.

3. Hasan Rahman, an associate at a major Los Angeles law firm, has
received a bonus check that after taxes has netted him \$280,000. He
plans to spend \$80,000 on a BMW and invest the balance, \$200,000.

Suppose that, quite by accident, Richie, Amanda, and Hasan meet at a

social function. Sometime during their conversation, they discuss their

financial plans. By the end of the evening, they agree to a deal. Richie

agrees to invest \$200,000 of his savings in the business and raise the

balance of the \$1 million needed to purchase the plant and equipment as

follows. Amanda agrees to buy a 50% interest for \$800,000. Hasan agrees

to lend Richie \$200,000 for four years at an interest rate of 12% per year.

Richie will be responsible for operating the business without the assistance

- f Amanda or Hasan.

Two financial claims came out of this meeting and the transactions that

the parties agree to. The first is an equity instrument issued by Richie and

purchased by Amanda for \$800,000. The other is a debt instrument issued

by Richie and purchased by Hasan for \$200,000. Thus, the two financial

assets allowed funds to be transferred from Amanda and Hasan, who had

surplus funds to invest, to Richie, who needed funds to invest in tangible

assets to manufacture the watches. This transfer of funds is the first

economic function of financial assets.

That Richie is not willing to invest his life savings of \$300,000 means

that he wanted to transfer part of that risk. He does so by selling Amanda a

financial asset that gives her a financial claim equal to one-half the cash

flow from the business. He secures an additional amount of capital from

Hasan, who is not willing to share in the risk of the business (except for

credit risk), in the form of an obligation requiring payment of a fixed cash

flow, regardless of the outcome of the venture. This shifting of risk is the

second economic function of financial assets.

```
Financial Markets

```

A **financial market** is a market where financial assets are exchanged (i.e.,

traded). Although the existence of a financial market is not a necessary

condition for the creation and exchange of a financial asset, in most

economies, financial assets are created and subsequently traded in some

type of financial market. The market in which a financial asset trades for

                           - r **cash market** .

immediate delivery is called the **spot market**

```
The Role of Financial Markets

```

We previously explained the two primary economic functions of financial

assets. Financial markets provide three additional economic functions.

First, the interactions of buyers and sellers in a financial market

determine the price of the traded asset. Or, equivalently, they determine the

required return on a financial asset. Because the inducement for firms to

acquire funds depends on the required return that investors demand, it is

this feature of financial markets that signals how the funds in the economy

should be allocated among financial assets. This is called the **price**

.

**discovery process**

Second, financial markets provide a mechanism for an investor to sell a

financial asset. Because of this ability, it is said that a financial market

- ffers **liquidity**, an attractive feature when circumstances either force or
motivate an investor to sell a financial asset. In the absence of liquidity, the

- wner would be forced to hold a debt instrument until it matures and an

equity instrument until the company is either voluntarily or involuntarily

liquidated. Although all financial markets provide some form of liquidity,

the degree of liquidity is one of the factors that characterize different

markets.

The third economic function of a financial market is that it reduces the

cost of transacting. There are two costs associated with transacting: search

costs and information costs.

**Search costs** represent explicit costs, such as the money spent to
advertise one's intention to sell or purchase a financial asset, and implicit
costs, such as the value of time spent locating a counterparty. The presence

- f some form of organized financial market reduces search costs.
**Information costs** are costs associated with assessing the investment merits

- f a financial asset, that is, the amount and the likelihood of the cash flow
expected to be generated. In a price efficient market, prices reflect the
aggregate information collected by all market participants.

```
Classification of Financial Markets

```

Financial markets can be classified in many ways. One way is by the type

- f financial claim, such as debt markets and equity markets. Another is by
the maturity of the claim. For example, there is a financial market for shortterm debt instruments, called the **money market**, and one for longer
.
maturity financial assets, called the **capital market**

Financial markets can be categorized as those dealing with financial

claims that are newly issued, called the **primary market**, and those for

exchanging financial claims previously issued, called the **secondary**

**market** - r the **market for seasoned instruments** .

Markets are classified as either **cash instrument markets**  - r **derivative**

**instruments markets** . (The latter is described briefly later in this chapter
and in more detail in chapter 39.)

A market can be classified by its organizational structure: It may be an

**auction market**, an **over-the-counter market**, or an **intermediated**

**market** .

All these classifications are summarized in table 1.1.

```
Table 1.1
```

Summary of classification of financial markets.

Classification by nature of claim:

- Debt market
- Equity market

Classification by maturity of claim:

- Money market
- Capital market

Classification by seasoning of claim:

- Primary market
- Secondary market

Classification by immediate delivery or future delivery:

- Cash (spot) market
- Derivatives market

Classification by organizational structure:

- Auction market
- Over-the-counter market
- Intermediated market

```
Market Participants

```

Participants in the global financial markets that issue and purchase financial

claims include households, business entities (corporations and

partnerships), national governments, national government agencies, state

and local governments, and supranationals (such as the World Bank, the

European Investment Bank, and the Asian Development Bank).

Business entities include nonfinancial and financial enterprises.

Nonfinancial enterprises manufacture products (for example, cars, steel, and

computers), provide nonfinancial services (including transportation,

utilities, and computer programming), or do both. The roles in financial

markets played by financial enterprises and a special type of financial

enterprise known as a financial intermediary are described in chapter 2.

Finally, although we have focused on market participants that create

and/or exchange financial assets, a broader definition of market participants

would include regulators of financial markets.

```
Globalization of Financial Markets

```

Because of the globalization of financial markets, entities in any country

seeking to raise funds need not be limited to their domestic financial

market. Nor are investors in a country limited to the financial assets issued

in their domestic market. Globalization means the integration of financial

markets throughout the world into an international financial market.

The factors that have led to the integration of financial markets are (1)

deregulation or liberalization of markets and the activities of market

participants in key financial centers of the world; (2) technological

advances for monitoring world markets, executing orders, and analyzing

financial opportunities; and (3) increased institutionalization of financial

markets.

Global competition has forced governments to deregulate (or liberalize)

various aspects of their financial markets so that their financial enterprises

can compete effectively around the world.

Technological advances have increased the integration and efficiency of

the global financial market. Advances in telecommunication systems have

linked market participants throughout the world, with the result that orders

can be executed within milliseconds. Advances in computer technology,

coupled with advanced telecommunication systems, allow the transmission

- f real-time information on security prices and other key information to
many participants in many places. Therefore, many investors can monitor
global financial markets and simultaneously assess how this information
will impact the risk/return profile of their portfolios. Significantly improved
computing power allows the instant manipulation of real-time market
information, so that arbitrage opportunities can be identified. Once these

- pportunities are identified, telecommunication systems permit the rapid
execution of orders to capture them.

The U.S. financial markets have shifted from domination by retail

**retail investors** we
investors to domination by financial institutions. By
mean individuals. For example, when you or I buy a share of common
stock, we are referred to as retail investors. Examples of financial
institutions are pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds,
commercial banks, and savings and loan associations. We describe these
financial institutions in the next eight chapters. Throughout this book, we
will refer to these financial institutions as **institutional investors** .

The shifting of the financial markets from dominance by retail investors

to institutional investors is referred to as the **institutionalization of**

**financial markets** . The same thing is occurring in other industrialized
countries. Unlike retail investors, institutional investors have been more
willing to transfer funds across national borders to improve portfolio
diversification or exploit perceived mispricing of financial assets in foreign
countries.

The potential portfolio diversification benefits associated with global

investing have been documented in numerous studies, which have

heightened the awareness of investors about the virtues of global investing.

```
Classification of Global Financial Markets

```

Although there is no uniform system for classifying the global financial

markets, an appropriate schematic presentation appears in figure 1.1. From

the perspective of a given country, financial markets can be classified as

either internal or external. The **internal market**, also referred to as the

**national market**, is composed of two parts: the domestic market and the

foreign market. The **domestic market** in a country is where issuers

domiciled in that country issue securities and where those securities are

subsequently traded.

```
Figure 1.1

```

Classification of global financial markets.

The **foreign market**  - f any country is where the securities of issuers not

domiciled in the country are sold and traded. The rules governing the

issuance of foreign securities are those imposed by regulatory authorities

where the security is issued. For example, securities issued by foreign

corporations in the United States must comply with the regulations set forth

in U.S. securities law. A non-Japanese corporation that seeks to offer

securities in Japan must comply with Japanese securities law and

regulations imposed by the Japanese Ministry of Finance.

Nicknames have developed to describe the various foreign markets. For

example, the foreign market in the United States is called the "Yankee

market." The foreign market in Japan is nicknamed the "Samurai market";

in the United Kingdom, the "Bulldog market"; in the Netherlands, the

"Rembrandt market"; and in Spain, the "Matador market."

The **external market**, also referred to as the **international market**,

allows trading of securities with two distinguishing features: (1) at issuance,

securities are offered simultaneously to investors in various countries; and

(2) they are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country. The

external market is commonly referred to as the **offshore market**, or, more

popularly, the **Euromarket** . [1]

```
Developed, Emerging, and Frontier Markets

```

Countries and their equity markets are typically divided into three

categories: developed, emerging (developing), and frontier (pre-emerging).

The differences among these three types are based mainly on two factors:

the development of their economies and of their capital markets. [2] Their

economic development refers mainly to their per capita income and

potential growth. Developed countries have higher levels of per capita

income but lower potential growth. The development of their capital

markets refers to the size of their market capitalization (described next), the

level of liquidity, and the development of their supporting regulatory and

legal bodies. These two characteristics affect the growth potential, risk, and

liquidity of investments in their markets. Developed countries are found

mostly in North America, Western Europe, and Australasia, including the

United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, New

Zealand, and Japan.

An emerging (developing) market is a country that has some of the

characteristics of a developed market but not all of them. Developing

countries include Brazil, Russia, India, and China (as a group, popularly

referred to as BRIC); Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain (PIIGS); and

- ther countries. A frontier or pre-emerging market is a market that is too
small and undeveloped to be considered an emerging market.

```
Asset Classes

```

In financial markets, participants talk about **asset classes** . In the financial

markets of most developed countries, the **asset classes** are (1) common

stocks, (2) bonds, (3) cash equivalents, and (4) real estate. How do market

participants define their asset classes? There are two ways they do so.

One way is in terms of the investment attributes that the members of the

asset class have in common. These investment characteristics include the

major economic factors that affect the value of the asset class, and as a

result, correlate highly with the returns of each member of the asset class,

have similar risk and return characteristics, and have a common legal or

regulatory structure. Hence, based on this way of defining asset classes, the

correlation between the returns of different asset classes would be low.

Another way of defining an asset class is based simply on the

characteristics of a group of assets that is treated as an asset class by asset

managers.

Based on these two ways of defining asset classes, the traditional asset

classes above can be extended to generate other such classes. From the

perspective of a U.S. investor, for example, the traditional asset classes

listed above have been expanded by separating foreign stocks and bonds

into those issued by U.S. entities and those issued by foreign entities.

Moreover, common stocks and bonds are further divided into more asset

classes based on the size of the corporation. Here, size refers to the **market**

**capitalization** - f the corporation's common stock. A corporation's market

capitalization (or simply, "market cap") is equal to the total market value of

its common stock outstanding. For example, suppose that a corporation has

50 million shares of common stock outstanding, and each share has a

market value of \$400. Then this corporation’s market cap is \$20 billion (50

million shares × \$400 per share). [3]

In the United States, one way of classifying asset classes is based on

market cap:

mega-cap stocks (greater than \$200 billion),

large-cap stocks (\$10 billion to \$200 billion),

mid-cap stocks (\$1 billion to \$10 billion),

small-cap stocks (\$300 million to \$1 billion),

micro-cap stocks (\$50 million to \$300 million), and

nano-cap stocks (less than \$50 million).

Except for real estate, all the asset classes identified above are referred

to as **traditional asset classes** . Real estate and all other asset classes that

are not in the above list are referred to as **nontraditional asset classes** - r

**alternative asset classes** . They include commodities, private equities,
hedge funds, venture capital, real assets, and currencies.

```
Derivatives Markets

```

So far, we have focused on the cash market for financial assets. With some

contracts, the contract holder has either the obligation or the choice to buy

- r sell a financial asset at some future time. The price of any such contract
derives its value from that of the underlying financial asset, financial index,

- r interest rate. Consequently, these contracts are called **derivative**

**instruments** .

```
Types of Derivative Instruments

```

The two basic types of derivative instruments are **futures/forward**

**contracts** and .

**options contracts**

A futures or forward contract is an agreement whereby two parties agree

to transact with respect to some financial asset at a predetermined price at a

specified future date. One party agrees to buy the financial asset; the other

agrees to sell the financial asset. Both parties are obligated to perform, and

neither party charges a fee. The distinction between a futures and a forward

contract and why this type of derivative is referred to as a risk-sharing type

- f derivative are explained in chapter 33.

An options contract gives the owner of the contract the right, but not the

- bligation, to buy (or sell) a financial asset at a specified price from (or to)
another party. The buyer of the contract must pay the seller a fee, which is

known as the option price. When the option grants the owner of the option

the right to buy a financial asset from the other party, the option is a **call**

**option** . If, instead, the option grants the owner of the option the right to sell
a financial asset to the other party, the option is a **put option** . Options are
more fully explained in chapter 34.

Derivative instruments are not limited to financial assets. Some

derivative instruments involve commodities and precious metals. Our focus

in this book, however, is on derivative instruments whose underlying asset

is a financial asset or some financial benchmark, such as a stock index or an

interest rate, a credit spread, or foreign exchange.

Moreover, other types of derivative instruments are basically packages

- f either forward contracts or option contracts. These include swaps, caps,
and floors, all of which are discussed in chapter 37.

```
The Role of Derivative Instruments

```

Derivative instruments provide issuers and investors with an inexpensive

way of controlling some major risks. While we describe most of these risks

in chapter 10, here are three examples that clearly illustrate the need for

derivative instruments:

1. Suppose that AT&T plans to obtain a bank loan for \$700 million
two months from now. The key risk here is that two months from now,
the interest rate will be higher than it is today. Even if the interest rate
were only one percentage point higher, AT&T would have to pay \$7
million more in annual interest. Clearly, then, issuers and borrowers
want a way to protect against a rise in interest rates.

2. IBM's defined benefit pension fund owns a portfolio consisting of
the common stock of a large number of companies. (We describe
defined benefit pension funds in chapter 4, but for now, the only
salient point is that this type of pension fund must make periodic
payments to the beneficiaries of the plan.) Suppose the pension fund
managers know that two months from now, they must sell stock in its
portfolio to pay beneficiaries \$20 million. The risk that the IBM
pension fund faces is that two months from now when the stocks are

sold, the price of most or all stocks may be lower than they are today.

If stock prices do decline, the pension fund will have to sell off more

shares to realize \$20 million. Thus, investors, such as the IBM pension

fund managers, face the risk of declining stock prices and may want to

protect against this risk.

3. Suppose Coca-Cola Company plans to issue a bond in Switzerland
and the periodic payments that the company must make to the
bondholders are denominated in the Swiss currency, the franc. The
amount in U.S. dollars that Coca-Cola must pay to receive the amount
in Swiss francs it has contracted to pay will depend on the exchange
rate at the time the payment must be made. For example, suppose that
at the time Coca-Cola plans to issue the bonds, the exchange rate is
such that 1 U.S. dollar is equal to 1.5 Swiss francs. So, for each 7.5
million Swiss francs that Coca-Cola must pay to the bondholders, it
must pay U.S. \$5 million. If at any time that a payment must be made
in Swiss francs, the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to the
Swiss franc, Coca-Cola will have to pay more U.S. dollars to satisfy its
contractual obligation. For example, if 1 U.S. dollar at the time of a
payment changes to 1.25 Swiss francs, Coca-Cola would have to pay
\$6 million to make a payment of 7.5 million Swiss francs. This is U.S.
\$1 million more than when it issued the bonds. Issuers and borrowers

who raise funds in a currency that is not their local currency face this

currency risk.

The derivative instruments described in part VIII of this book can be

used by the two borrowers (AT&T and Coca-Cola) and the one investor

(IBM's defined benefit pension fund) in these examples to eliminate or to

reduce the kinds of risks that they face.

As we will see in later chapters, derivatives markets may have at least

three advantages over the corresponding cash (spot) market for the same

financial asset. First, depending on the derivative instrument, it may cost

less to execute a transaction in the derivatives market to adjust the risk

exposure to new economic information than it would cost to make that

adjustment in the cash market. Second, transactions typically can be

accomplished faster in the derivatives market than in the cash one. Third,

some derivatives markets can absorb a greater dollar transaction without an

adverse effect on the price of the derivative instrument; that is, the

derivatives market may be more liquid than the cash market.

The key point here is that derivative instruments play a critical role in

global financial markets. A May 1994 report published by the U.S.

Government Accountability Office (GAO) titled _Financial Derivatives:_

_Actions Needed to Protect the Financial System_ recognized the importance

- f derivatives for market participants. Page 6 of the report states:

Derivatives serve an important function of the global financial marketplace, providing end-users with

- pportunities to better manage financial risks associated with their business transactions. The rapid
growth and increasing complexity of derivatives reflect both the increased demand from end-users
for better ways to manage their financial risks and the innovative capacity of the financial services
industry to respond to market demands.

Unfortunately, derivatives instruments are too often viewed by the

general public—and sometimes regulators and legislative bodies—as

vehicles for pure speculation (that is, legalized gambling). Without

derivative instruments and the markets in which they trade, the financial

systems throughout the world would not be as integrated as they are today.

```
Financial Markets and the Real Economy

```

In the introduction to this chapter, we explained how a market economy can

be divided into two markets, the product market and the factor market. We

then explained the critical role of financial markets in the efficient

allocation of capital. Another way of looking at a market economy is by

dividing it into two markets: (1) the real economy and (2) the paper

economy. The **real economy** refers to markets where products and services

are produced and their prices are determined. The **paper economy** refers to

markets where financial assets are traded (i.e., financial markets) and the

prices of these assets are determined. The financial markets include not just

the cash market but derivatives markets.

What is the linkage between the real economy and the paper economy?

In the United States, there have been two well-known crises in the paper

economy that have spilled over into the real economy, causing severe

economic problems.

On October 29, 1929 ("Black Monday"), the stock market crashed. The

most popular stock market index at the time, the Dow Jones Industrial

Average, fell by 25% in two days and by 30% in one week. The decline in

the value of U.S. stocks resulted in millions of Americans losing a major

part, if not all, of their wealth. This loss of wealth reduced consumer

purchasing, which in turn forced business firms to reduce operations. In

turn, this led to a further loss of jobs. The end result was the Great

Depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1939, representing the longest

economic depression in the United States. During this period,

unemployment reached 20%, the gross domestic product fell by 30%,

industrial production fell by 47%, and the consumer price index fell by 33%

(i.e., the country experienced deflation). In addition, because of the lack of

confidence in the banking system, numerous banks failed as a result of a

run on the banks (i.e., many individuals simultaneously withdrawing

deposits) and borrowers being unable to repay their loans (e.g., resulting in

foreclosure on residential properties). In the 1920s, an average of 600 banks

failed each year. In 1930, however, 1,350 banks either suspended or

terminated their operations. [4] The next year, 2,293 banks failed or suspended

- perations, and this number increased to almost 4,000 banks by 1933. It
was during the Great Depression that major legislation involving bank
regulation and financial markets were proposed by President Franklin
Roosevelt and subsequently passed by Congress. Since then the legislation
has been updated.

The next major legislative changes dealing with financial markets came

in 2008 as a result of what has been referred to variously as the global

financial crisis or the global recession. In the summer of 2007, the market

collapsed for certain financial instruments (one type of mortgage-backed

securities, which we discuss in chapter 30). There was a spillover from this

market to the real estate market, which experienced a pricing bubble owing

to low interest rates and buyers' belief in ever-increasing home prices.

Banks and other financial institutions using excessive leverage [5] and

derivative products (such as credit default swaps) faced liquidity problems

as the credit markets dried up. The bankruptcy of a major investment bank,

Lehman Brothers, in 2008 was a key event that triggered the global

financial crisis. The crisis resulted in a slowdown in economic growth and a

high unemployment rate. There were fears of another Great Depression, not

just in the United States but worldwide. In fact, while the United States

experienced its worst recession since the Great Depression, such countries

as France, Germany, and Japan realized the slowest economic growth in

decades. These events led to legislation in many countries to reduce the

likelihood of a problem in the paper economy leading to a severe economic

crisis in the real economy. In the United States, the major legislation

seeking to accomplish this was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and

Consumer Protection Act of 2010. As succinctly stated in this act, its intent

is:

To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency

in the financial system, to end "too big to fail," to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts,

to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.

We describe various provisions of this act, referred to simply as the "DoddFrank Act," in later chapters.

What is interesting is that despite the linkage observed between the

paper economy and the real economy when the stock market crashed in

1929 and during the Great Depression that followed, it seems that

macroeconomic models did not focus on this linkage until the 2008

financial crisis. As noted in a 2012 report by Germany's central bank, [6] the

Deutsche Bundesbank:

Prior to the crisis, financial markets were generally not included in macro models, nor was this

regarded as necessary because, for the most part, the financial markets were not themselves deemed

to contain any potential to cause disruptions. In the wake of the crisis, however, financial markets

have been increasingly integrated into empirical and theoretical macroeconomic models. [7]

```
Key Points

```

- The financial system is composed of three parts: financial markets,
financial institutions, and market infrastructure.

- A financial asset (financial instrument or security) entitles the owner to
the future cash flow to be paid by the issuer.

- The holder of a financial asset's claim can be either an equity or a debt
claim.

- The value of any financial asset equals the present value of the expected
cash flow.

- Three types of risk are associated with investing in financial assets:
purchasing power or inflation risk, default or credit risk, and exchange-rate
risk.

- The two principal economic functions of a financial asset are (1) to
transfer funds from those who have surplus funds to invest to those who
need funds to invest in tangible assets, and (2) to transfer funds in a way
that redistributes the unavoidable risk associated with the cash flow

generated by tangible assets among those seeking and those providing the

funds.

- Financial markets provide the following three additional functions
beyond that of financial assets themselves: (1) They provide a mechanism
for determining the price (or, equivalently, the required return) of financial
assets; (2) they make assets more liquid; and (3) they reduce the costs of
exchanging assets.

- The costs associated with market transactions are search costs and

information costs.

- Financial markets can be classified by type of financial claim (debt
instrument versus equity claim), by the maturity of claims (money market
versus capital market), by whether the security is newly issued or seasoned
(primary market versus secondary market), and by the type of

- rganizational structure.
- Derivative instruments derive their value from an underlying financial

asset.

- Derivative instruments allow market players to more efficiently
accomplish their financial goals.

- Globalization means the integration of financial markets throughout the
world into an international financial market and allows (1) entities in any
country seeking to raise funds to look outside their domestic financial
market and (2) investors in a country to invest in financial assets issued

- utside their domestic market.
- The factors contributing to the integration of financial markets include (1)
deregulation or liberalization of markets and the activities of market
participants in key financial centers of the world; (2) technological
advances for monitoring world markets, executing orders, and analyzing
financial opportunities; and (3) the increased institutionalization of financial
markets.

- The institutionalization of financial markets refers to the shifting of the
financial markets from dominance by retail investors to dominance by
institutional investors.

- From the perspective of a given country, financial markets can be
classified as either internal (or national) or external.

- A country's internal market consists of its domestic market and foreign
market.

- A country's domestic market is one in which issuers domiciled in the
country issue securities and in which those securities are subsequently
traded. In a country's foreign market, securities of issuers not domiciled in
the country are sold and traded.

- In classifying countries and stock markets as developed, emerging, or
frontier, two characteristics are used: (1) their economic development (such
as their per capita income and potential growth) and (2) the development of
their capital markets in terms of market capitalization, the level of liquidity,
and supporting regulatory and legal bodies.

- Developed stock markets are in countries that have higher levels of per
capita income but lower potential growth.

- Developed stock markets are found mostly in North America, Western
Europe, and Australasia, including the United States, Canada, Germany, the
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

- An emerging (developing) market is a market in a country that has some
- f the characteristics of a developed market, but not all of them.
- Developing countries include Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC)
and Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain (PIIGS).

- A frontier or pre-emerging market is a market in a country that is too
small and undeveloped to be considered an emerging market.

- Financial assets are grouped together into asset classes.
- The traditional asset classes include stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.
- Nontraditional asset classes or alternative asset classes include real estate,
commodities, private equities, hedge funds, venture capital, real assets, and
currencies.

- The real economy is the market where products and services are produced
and where the prices of those products and services are determined.

- The markets where financial assets are traded (i.e., financial markets) are
referred to as the paper economy.

- Financial markets are linked to the real economy.

   - the differing views on the degree of government intervention in the
financial market.

Financial markets play a prominent role in many economies, and

governments around the world have long deemed it necessary to participate

in various aspects of these markets. This is clear from the history of

financial crises and resulting economic recessions that have occurred in

modern capitalist economies.

Governments play various roles in the financial system. They can do so

in one or more of four ways. First, they can regulate financial markets,

including financial intermediaries participating in the market. Second, they

can act as financial intermediaries by making loans or guaranteeing loans to

sectors or parts of the economy that are deemed to need assistance. Third,

governments can influence financial markets at the macroeconomic level

through the actions of their central banks. Finally, they can provide bailouts

- f or financial assistance to market sectors or corporations (financial and
nonfinancial) during periods of market turmoil or distress.

In this chapter, we explain the role of governments and government

policies regarding financial markets. There is considerable ideological

debate about the proper role that governments should play in financial

markets, and in the last section of this chapter, we discuss that debate. U.S.

financial regulations are described in several chapters in this book.

```
Macroprudential versus Microprudential Government Policies

```

Government policy dealing with a country's financial system falls into two

categories: macroprudential policy and microprudential policy. A

government's macroprudential policy seeks to reduce the risk to the

financial system as a whole. The risk to the financial system is referred to as

**systemic financial risk** - r simply **systemic risk** . In general, the term

systemic risk refers to the probability that an entire system will collapse or

fail. When applied to finance, systemic risk is referred to as systemic

financial risk. The key here is the interconnectedness of the financial

system's financial institutions and markets, as well as common exposures to

economic factors, not only within a country but globally. In contrast to

macroprudential policy, which focuses on the welfare of the entire financial

system, microprudential policy seeks to control the risks associated with

financial institutions. The interconnectedness of the financial institutions is

not relevant here.

As a result of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, policymakers

throughout the world have focused on macroprudential policy, as it became

apparent during that crisis that focusing only on the safety of individual

financial institutions is not adequate to protect the financial system as a

whole. The following four causes of the financial crisis showed

policymakers that appropriate response tools are needed to deal with

systemic risk: (1) excessive use of leverage and risk taking, (2) a bubble in

the pricing of assets in a key sector of the financial market (residential

property), (3) regulatory and supervisory failures, and (4) widespread

failure of market discipline. We describe these causes in the chapters to

follow.

As a result of this focus on macroprudential policy, the tools available to

governments for implementing such policy and the impediments and

challenges to the implementation of those tools by governments are now the

subject of debate. The tools for implementing macroprudential policy are

described later in this section. As for challenges, there are questions

regarding whether governments should establish one supervisory entity to

implement all macroprudential policy or share the responsibility among

several supervisory entities. When a single supervisory entity is designated,

**central bank** .
that entity is typically the country's

```
Regulation of Financial Markets

```

In their regulatory capacities, governments greatly influence the

development and evolution of financial markets and institutions. It is

important to realize that governments, issuers, and investors tend to interact

and affect one another's actions in certain ways. Thus, it is not surprising to

find that a market's reactions to regulations often prompt a new response by

the government, which can cause the institutions in the market to change

their behavior further, and so on. A sense of how the government can affect

a market and its participants is important for understanding the numerous

markets and securities that will be described in the chapters to come.

Here we discuss regulations. Our purpose is not to provide a detailed

account of the regulatory structures and rules. Rather, we provide a broad

view of the goals and types of regulations, using the United States as our

primary case, although we do mention regulations in other counties.

```
Justification for Regulation

```

The standard explanation or justification for governmental regulation of a

market is that the market, left to itself, will not produce its particular goods

- r services in an efficient manner and at the lowest possible cost. Efficiency
and low-cost production are hallmarks of a perfectly competitive market.

Thus, a market unable to produce efficiently must be one that is not

competitive at the time and will not gain that status by itself in the

foreseeable future. Of course, it is also possible that governments might

regulate markets that are viewed as competitive currently but are unable to

sustain competition, and thus low-cost production, over the long run. A

version of this justification for regulation is that the government controls a

feature of the economy that the market mechanisms of competition and

pricing could not manage without help. A shorthand expression used by

economists to describe the reasons for regulation is **market failure** . A

market is said to fail if it cannot, by itself, maintain all the requirements for

a competitive situation.

The regulatory structure in the United States is largely the result of

financial crises that have occurred at various times. Until the 2008–2009

financial crisis, most regulatory mechanisms were the products of the stock

market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some of the

regulations may make little economic sense in the current financial market,

but they can be traced back to some abuse that legislators encountered, or

thought they encountered, at one time. Further, in addition to financial

institution regulation, three other forms of regulation are most often a

function of the federal government, with state governments playing a

secondary role. For that reason, the present discussion of regulation

concentrates on the central government and any agencies it creates.

```
Forms of Government Regulation of Financial Markets

```

A government's regulation of financial markets can take one or more of

four forms: regulation of (1) disclosures, (2) financial activities, (3)

financial institutions, and (4) foreign participants. Here we discuss each

form of regulation.

**`Regulation of disclosures`** Regulation of disclosures requires issuers of
securities to make public a large amount of financial information to current
and potential investors. The standard justification for disclosure rules is that
the managers of the issuing firm have more information about the financial
health and future of the firm than do investors who own or are considering
the purchase of the firm's securities. The cause of market failure here, if

indeed it occurs, is commonly described as **asymmetric information**,

which means investors and managers are subject to uneven access to or

uneven possession of information. Also, the problem is said to be one of

"agency," in the sense that the firm's managers, who act as agents for

investors, may act in their own interests to the disadvantage of investors.

The advocates of disclosure rules say that, in the absence of the rules,

investors with comparatively limited knowledge about the firm would allow

agents to engage in such practices.

The United States is firmly committed to disclosure regulation. The

Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 led to the

creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is

responsible for gathering and publicizing relevant information and for

punishing those issuers who supply fraudulent or misleading data.

However, none of the SEC's requirements or actions constitutes a

guarantee, a certification, or an approval of the securities being issued.

Moreover, the government's rules do not represent an attempt to prevent the

issuance of risky assets. Instead, the government's (and the SEC's) sole

motivation in this regard is to supply diligent and intelligent investors with

the information needed for a fair evaluation of the securities.

The need for disclosure regulation has been debated by economists.

Some economists have denied the need and justification for disclosure

rules, arguing that the securities market would, without governmental

assistance, get all the information necessary for a fair pricing of new as well

as existing securities. [1] In this view, the securities laws supposedly

extracting key data from agent-managers are redundant. One way to look at

this argument is to ask what investors would do if a corporation trying to

sell new shares did not provide all the data investors wanted. In that case,

investors either would refuse to buy that corporation's security, giving it a

zero value, or would discount or underprice the security. Thus, a

corporation concealing important information would pay a penalty in the

form of reduced proceeds from the sale of a new security. The prospect of

this penalty is potentially as much incentive to disclose as are the rules of a

government agency, such as the SEC. Several studies have shown how

management can benefit from voluntarily improved disclosure. [2]

**`Regulation of financial activities`** Regulation of financial activities
consists of rules about traders of securities and trading on financial markets.
A prime example of this form of regulation is the set of rules against trading
by insiders who are corporate officers or others in positions to know more
about a firm's prospects than the general investing public. Insider trading is
another problem posed by asymmetric information. A second example of
this type of regulation would be rules regarding the structure and operations

- f exchanges where securities are traded. The argument supporting these
rules rests on the possibility that members of exchanges may be able, under
certain circumstances, to collude and defraud the general investing public.

Like disclosure, financial activity regulation is also widely implemented

in the United States. The SEC has the duty to carefully monitor the trades

that corporate officers, directors, or major stockholders ("insiders") make in

the securities of their firms. The SEC and another federal government

entity, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), share

responsibility for the federal regulation of trading in derivative instruments.

**`Regulation`** **`of`** **`financial`** **`institutions`** Regulation of financial
institutions is the form of governmental monitoring that restricts these
institutions' activities in the vital areas of lending, borrowing, and funding.
The justification for this form of regulation is that these financial firms have
a special role to play in a modern economy. Financial institutions help
households and firms to save. Depository institutions also facilitate the
complex payments among many elements of the economy, and they serve
as conduits for the government's monetary policy. Thus, it is often argued
that the failure of these financial institutions would severely disrupt the

economy.

Historically, the U.S. government imposed an extensive array of

regulations on financial institutions. Most of this legislation traces its

historical roots to the Great Depression in the 1930s and deals with

restrictions on the activities of financial institutions. (Later chapters explain

some of the significant changes subsequently made to these regulations.) In

recent years, expanded regulations restrict how financial institutions

manage their assets and liabilities, typically in the form of minimum capital

requirements for certain regulated institutions. These capital requirements

are based on the various types of risk faced by regulated financial

institutions and are popularly referred to as risk-based capital requirements.

**`Regulation of foreign participants`** Government regulation of
foreign participants limits the roles that foreign firms can play in domestic
markets and their ownership or control of financial institutions. Many
countries regulate participation by foreign firms in domestic financial
securities markets. Like most countries, the United States extensively
reviews and changes its policies regarding foreign firms' activities in the
U.S. financial markets on a regular basis.

```
Governments as Financial Intermediaries

```

Governments throughout the world have been the provider of loans or the

guarantor of loans for sectors of the credit market that, in their view, are so

critical to the operation of the economy that intervention is needed. In the

United States, a federal loan guarantee provided by the federal government

is a statutory commitment to pay either all or a specified part of the debt

servicing (principal and interest) to a lender or to the holder of a debt

security should the borrower default.

In providing loans and guarantees, a central government effectively acts

as a nonprofit financial intermediary, borrowing money at the lowest

possible rate and providing loans at a lower rate than a profit-oriented

financial intermediary would, or guaranteeing loans on which it charges a

reasonable guarantor rate. Governments can set up what is effectively a

financial intermediary entity by creating either a government agency or a

government-related financial entity. Before any government entity can grant

any loans or provide loan guarantees, the central government must first

authorize and allocate funding for the program run by the entity.

Governments will identify the credit sectors that need assistance. In the

United States, for example, the government has provided loans or loan

guarantees for qualified agricultural loans, residential housing loans, small

business loans, and student loans for postsecondary education. For example,

the U.S. Small Business Administration, a federal government agency, does

not make direct loans to small businesses. Instead, it has several programs

to help a small business obtain debt financing either through a guarantee of

a loan provided by a third-party lender or through a guarantee of bonds

issued by the small business.

Probably the best-known economic sector in which the government has

established agencies or government-sponsored entities to provide credit

support is the residential mortgage market. We describe the various entities

that the U.S. government has established to facilitate the flow of credit to

this critical market sector in later chapters. There is no doubt that

government intervention in the housing finance market has resulted in a

strong residential mortgage market in many countries.

However, as with any intervention, limits should be imposed. This was

evident from the subprime mortgage crisis that began in the summer of

2007 in the United States, a crisis we describe in chapter 30. Critics of the

government's role in the housing finance sector have argued that the

government has effectively nationalized the country's mortgage system,

with three government-related entities, the Federal National Mortgage

Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation

(Freddie Mac), and the Federal Housing Administration (discussed in

chapters 29 and 30), insuring almost 90% of U.S. housing loans. It is argued

that this emphasis on home ownership, along with low interest rates, fueled

the housing bubble that burst in the summer of 2007. Moreover,

government policies that fostered housing ownership for those who could

not really afford the costs associated with owning a home, the so-called

subprime borrowers, added to the problems in the housing finance market.

Consequently, some U.S. congressional leaders are skeptical of the

government's role in the housing finance market and are seeking a quick

and significant reduction in the government's role in housing. Other

congressional leaders feel that withdrawal of support by the government in

the housing finance market will have a devastating impact on the housing

sector and the economy.

Estimates of the cost of federal loans and loan guarantees have been

made by economists. Some economists have argued that the government

does not have the ability to accurately price the risk of loans and loan

guarantees. Admittedly, a comprehensive estimate of the value of a federal

loan guarantee, for example, is not simple. [3] Moreover, owing to political

pressures, critics of government agencies operating such programs point out

that the government routinely underestimates the risk to taxpayers of credit

support programs.

In addition to government loans and loan guarantee programs, there are

government-provided insurance programs. Effectively, the government is

acting as a financial institution (an insurance company in this case),

providing an insurance policy with no intent to realize a profit.

```
Government Influence on Financial Markets through the Actions

of the Central Bank

```

**central bank** .
Most countries have a government entity referred to as its
This entity is responsible for the financial matters of that country, primarily
through the implementation of monetary policy. **Monetary policy** is the set

- f tools that a government or its central bank can use to influence the
economy and financial system for the purpose of achieving the country's
economic objectives. Monetary policy tools are linked to the banking
system, as described in chapter 7.

In the United States, monetary policy is carried out by the Board of

Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Fed), and the statutory objectives of

monetary policy are set forth in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Those

- bjectives are stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate interest
rates. Carrying out statutory monetary policy is the Fed's Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC issued a statement to explain its
monetary goals following its meeting in January 2012. The statement
indicated that with respect to stable prices (or equivalently, the rate of
inflation), a 2% inflation rate was consistent with the long-run statutory

- bjective of monetary policy, in the view of the Fed. Although monetary
policy's statutory objective is the maximum level of employment, that level
is principally determined by nonmonetary factors affecting the job market.
Consequently, because those nonmonetary factors change over time, the
FOMC does not state a specific number for this statutory objective.

Estimates are that the long-run objective in terms of unemployment rate

tends to be between 5.2% and 5.8%.

The tools available to the Fed for implementing monetary policy to

accomplish its objectives are described in chapter 7. The main tool involves

influencing key interest rates in the financial market.

In the United States, the Fed is also a lender of last resort, a role that it

plays during turmoil in the financial markets. We discuss this role below.

This is a function it performs in maintaining the country's financial

stability. The central banks in most countries operate as if they had a policy

- f responsibility for maintaining financial stability. [4]

The objectives of a central bank vary from country to country. In most

countries, price stability is typically the primary monetary policy objective.

Here are three examples. The Bank of England, the central bank of the

United Kingdom, states that its two core purposes are what it refers to as

monetary stability, defined as follows: "Monetary stability means stable

prices and confidence in the currency. Stable prices are defined by the

Government's inflation target, which the Bank seeks to meet through the

decisions taken by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)." [5] The European

Central Bank (ECB), the central bank for the 17 European Union countries

that use the euro as their currency, states that "the primary objective of the

ECB's monetary policy is to maintain price stability." [6] The ECB defines

price stability as "maintaining inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over

the medium term." Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, states that the

bank's monetary policy should be "aimed at achieving price stability,

thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy." [7]

In addition, in most countries, central banks have supervisory authority

- ver the country's banking system.

```
Financial Stability and Monetary Policy

```

As noted above, monetary policy is linked to the banking system. Financial

stability is about avoiding an extreme event that could potentially impose

large costs on the financial system and the real economy. It is here that the

tools of macroprudential policy of a country are implemented, by (1)

enhancing the financial system's liquidity regulation so as to reduce the

frequency of unintended tightening of credit, which can freeze the efficient

- perations of markets, and (2) supervising the infrastructure of financial
markets.

Financial stability is critical to the effective implementation of monetary

policy. As William C. Dudley, then-president and chief executive officer of

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in 2013:

In my mind, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis has been that monetary policy cannot work

properly when there is financial instability. When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market

functioning and can also impair bank balance sheets. The result can be disruption to the financial

intermediation function with resulting constraints on the availability of credit for households and

businesses. This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress

- n the weakened financial system. Obviously, this is not a favorable dynamic. [8]

Unlike the quantitative objectives mentioned above for the primary goal

- f monetary policy of price stability of some targeted rate (e.g., 2%), it is
difficult to express a financial stability objective in quantitative terms.

```
Government Bailouts

```

Governments throughout the world have used public (taxpayer) funds to

provide financial support to prevent the failure of major industries, financial

institutions, corporations, and subnational entities viewed as essential to a

country's economy or financial system.

This practice followed by governments is referred to as a **government**

**bailout**, or simply bailout. Table 2.1 lists the history of U.S. government

bailouts by type of entity that was the beneficiary of financial assistance:

nonfinancial corporations, financial corporations, industries, and one city.

In the United States, the two entities responsible for the design and

implementation of bailout plans are the U.S. Department of the Treasury

and the Fed. The latter does so through its lending and credit programs.

Forms of Bailouts

```

Government assistance can come in various forms. As explained above, the

government can make federal loans. For example, a federal loan of \$1.75

billion was provided to Franklin National Bank in 1974. The Fed has

provided a line of credit for bailouts to facilitate the acquisition of troubled

entities. For example, when the investment banking firm of Bear Stearns

nearly collapsed in June 2008, the Fed provided JPMorgan Chase with a

\$30 billion line of credit to support the purchase of Bear Stearns. Although

the purchase price was \$236 million, the potential obligations of Bear

Stearns that JPMorgan Chase was assuming as a result of the acquisition

required that such a line of credit be provided. In the case of American

International Group (AIG), several forms of financial assistance were

provided: an initial \$85 billion line of credit with the Fed, followed by \$110

billion in loans from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal

Reserve Bank of New York (\$40 billion of the Treasury's loan was through

the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), discussed later in the chapter).

The federal government can provide a loan and loan guarantee coupled

with an equity position in the company seeking a bailout. The equity

position typically comes in the form of a financial instrument called a **stock**

**warrant**, allowing taxpayers to benefit from a recovery. Stock warrants

were provided in both the AIG and Chrysler bailouts. In the case of AIG,

the federal government effectively got a 79.9% equity interest (as well as

the right to suspend dividends to stockholders) in that company in exchange

for its \$85 billion line of credit.

In the case of the savings and loan (S&L) industry, which had been

having financial difficulties starting in the early 1980s, [9] Congress in 1989

passed taxpayer-financed bailout legislation, the Financial Institutions

Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, which provided \$50 billion to

close failed S&Ls. For the purpose of liquidating insolvent S&Ls, the

legislation established the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). The crisis

was so severe that additional funding of \$78 billion for the RTC was

required by March 1990. In total, it has been estimated that the cost of

bailing out the S&L industry during that episode was about \$200 billion.

The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout shown in table 2.1 is the case

- f two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) established by Congress
to provide credit to the housing sector in the form of mortgages. These two
entities had \$5 trillion in debt in the form of mortgage-backed securities and

- ther debt. Both were placed under conservatorship of the U.S. government
in 2008, and Congress is entertaining several plans for the future of these
two corporations. The bailout plan for the two GSEs as provided for in an
agreement with the U.S. Treasury was future support and capital
investments of up to \$100 billion per GSE, which called for the granting to
the Treasury of (1) a form of stock (senior preferred stock) and (2) warrants
giving the government a 79.9% ownership stake.

Two banks, Citigroup and Bank of America, received several forms of

aid. Both banks had a pool of troubled assets in the form of mortgagebacked securities. The federal government agreed to limit the losses

realized on their pool of troubled assets: Citigroup's portfolio had a market

value of \$310 billion, and Bank of America’s had a market value of \$118

billion. In addition, for both banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation (FDIC) and the Fed committed additional amounts: Citigroup

received \$10 billion and \$220 billion from the FDIC and the Fed,

respectively, and Bank of America received \$2.5 billion and \$87.1 billion

from the FDIC and the Fed, respectively. There was one more component to

the bailout package for both banks: money from the program described

next.

The largest government bailout was a special program established by

Congress in October 2008, TARP, which was part of the Emergency

Economic Stabilization Act. TARP authorized \$700 billion to be used by

the Treasury Department to deal with the adverse economic consequences

resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis that began in the summer of

2007. The funds were to be used to purchase certain types of debt

instruments as well as equity from financial institutions. Although the initial

authorization was for \$700 billion, subsequent legislation in 2010 (the

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) reduced that

amount to \$475 billion. Three of the financial institutions in table 2.1

received TARP money: AIG (\$40 billion), Citigroup (\$45 billion), and

Bank of America (\$45 billion, with \$10 billion for Merrill Lynch).

In addition, governments get involved in negotiating deals for troubled

entities or in assisting in their acquisition by financially sounder entities.

For example, a large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM),

was heavily dependent on borrowed funds. Because of the Russian debt

crisis in 1998, the positions taken by LTCM that turned on the fortunes of

Russia's government debt resulted in losses that were large enough to make

it impossible for LTCM to repay the amount it had borrowed from banks

and other financial institutions. The amount owed was sufficiently large that

a default would have had a ripple effect throughout the credit markets. As a

result, a consortium of private financial entities was organized by the

Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the purpose of buying LTCM so as

to cover its debt obligations. Simultaneously, the Fed took pressure off the

credit markets by taking action to make more credit available. The end

result was that because of the actions by the consortium, the government

did not make any payments in this bailout (and hence LTCM is not listed in

table 2.1). No creditors realized losses, and the shareholders of LTCM

realized no value for their equity interest.

Let's look at a bailout by a central government outside the United States.

A good example is the Japanese government bailout and guarantees of its

commercial banks due to the collapse of the Japanese stock and real estate

markets. Since the end of 1989, the Japanese economy and stock markets

have experienced an extended period of weakness. The major Japanese

stock index, the Nikkei 225 stock market index, reached a high of

38,915.87 at the end of 1989. (As of year-end 2018, it remains less than

23,000.) The Japanese real estate bubble also peaked in late 1989 and

collapsed after December 1989. There have been severe ramifications of

this collapse in the stock and real estate markets. The first is the effect on

the Japanese banking system. The collapse of the Japanese stock and real

estate markets forced many major banks into bankruptcy. Many major

banks became "zombies," defined as financial institutions with negative net

worth. The Japanese government kept these banks marginally "alive"

through guarantees and bailouts. These zombie banks had large amounts of

nonperforming loans on their balance sheets, were neither dead nor alive,

and could not support economic growth through loans.

```
Issues Associated with Government Bailouts

```

Advocates of government bailouts assert that in today's financial system,

certain financial institutions or markets are just "too big to fail." More

specifically, the interconnectedness of financial institutions throughout not

- nly the U.S. financial market but also the global financial markets results
in systemic risk that could have severe consequences for the financial
system and the real economy. The determination of what financial
institution is too big to fail is not always clear. For example, as explained
earlier in this chapter, Bears Stearns was rescued in 2008 through
guarantees and the purchasing of its assets by JPMorgan Chase. Yet a much
larger financial institution, the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers
Holdings, with \$615 billion in debt and with considerable global
interconnectedness, was allowed to fail and file for bankruptcy.

The argument made by advocates for maintaining large banks is that the

global economy and the global financial system are large and complex. To

supply large amounts of capital to multinational corporations and to meet

governments' needs require large banks that have the ability to operate

globally and provide funding at a competitive rate. The economies of scale

that can be achieved by large banks can make that operational efficiency

possible. Moreover, no evidence suggests that smaller banks result in less

systemic risk. For example, there can be just as much interconnectedness

among many smaller banks as among big international banks. The financial

meltdown leading to the Great Depression is an example of systemic risk

arising from the failure of many small banks.

Ben Bernanke, then chair of the Fed, in remarks to the Federal Reserve

Bank of Boston in October 2009, and in response to a question from the

former Bank of England deputy governor, said that he preferred a "more

subtle approach without losing the economic benefit of multi-function,

international (financial) firms." [10] He also argued that banks would have to

have plans—referred to as "living wills"—for breaking up once a certain

size was reached. Although he did not support the breakup of large banks,

he did believe that bank supervisors should impose restrictions on the

growth of banks that fail to have good governance and risk management

controls.

Opponents of the notion of too big to fail argue that a major risk is

introduced into the financial system when the management of financial

institutions believes the government will view those institutions as essential

to the financial system and will not allow them to fail. This is known as a

"Fed put." The risk associated with such a view is that a government safety

net will encourage management to take on excessive risks. This is

connected to a concept well known in the insurance industry: moral hazard.

This concept is the tendency for the existence of an insurance policy

(guarantee) to encourage risk taking by the insured and, as a result, enhance

the probability of a payout of an insurance policy. Another concern is that

banking regulators will be reluctant to prosecute entities that are viewed as

too big to fail.

The question is whether too big to fail is too "too big to solve." Two

solutions have been proposed. The first approach is a commitment by the

government that it will no longer permit a bailout. This approach is not

likely to be adopted by governments, or, even if adopted, not likely to be

used. The second approach is to identify what is known as "systemically

important" financial institutions and impose on any such firms a higher

capital requirement than for other financial institutions (i.e., a capital

surcharge). A **systemically important financial institution** (SIFI) is one

that, in the view of regulators, is a large firm whose failure would cause a

financial crisis. The notion of a SIFI was introduced as part of the banking

capital requirement regulations set forth by the Basel Committee on

Banking Supervision, which we discuss later in this chapter.

This second approach is the one that the United States is attempting to

implement as part of its major legislation, the Dodd-Frank Act. Some

economists have argued that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have not

reduced the systemic risk through contagion but have in fact exacerbated

that risk. [11] As Glenn Hubbard points out, there were two effective ways that

the Fed dealt with the financial crisis but are now of limited use as a result

- f provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. First, at the height of the financial
crisis, the Fed provided new borrowing facilities to supply badly needed
liquidity. Instead of recognizing the importance of providing liquidity
facilities during market turmoil (e.g., that during 2008–2009), the Fed had
its lending authority reduced and its collateral requirements for emergency
lending were increased (making it more difficult for an entity to borrow). [12]
Second, the injection of public capital to fight a financial crisis, such as the
government did by purchasing interests in banks through the TARP
program, is barred by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Implementing this second approach requires identifying those entities

that are SIFIs. This is not easy. Although the targeted candidates are

typically large banks, the Fed has considered applying this approach to

large asset management firms and traditional insurance companies.

However, these market players do not impose systemic risk, and the cost of

higher capital requirements on their lines of business would place them at a

competitive disadvantage relative to their competitors who are not anointed

with the title "SIFI."

The U.S. financial regulatory framework prior to the financial crisis of

2008 can best be described as one that for the most part limited its focus to

individual financial institutions and financial markets. As a result, the

responsibility for monitoring and addressing overall risks to financial

stability did not reside with any single regulator, leaving gaps in the

regulation of different types of financial institutions that operated across

multiple financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed this problem

through the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC),

which has the authority to constrain nonbank financial entities from what

the FSOC views as excessive risk taking that threatens the stability of the

financial system. An important role given to the FSOC is the authority to

determine whether any action should be taken to break up those firms that it

perceives as representing a "grave threat" to the financial stability of the

United States. The FSOC is chaired by the secretary of the Treasury, guided

by the expertise of the federal financial regulators, an independent

insurance expert appointed by the president, and state regulators. Thus, the

FSOC is chaired by a member of the executive branch, not the Federal

Reserve.

```
Financial Regulators Outside the United States

```

Financial regulations in other countries have many similarities to their U.S.

counterparts but some differences as well. Financial regulation in the

United Kingdom and China are considered in later chapters. Here we

briefly describe financial regulation in Germany, France, Switzerland,

Singapore, and Japan.

```
Germany

```

The financial regulatory authority for Germany is the Federal Financial

Supervisory Authority, which was formed in 2002. It is better known as

"BaFin." It was formed by the merger of the Federal Banking Supervisory

Office, the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading, and the

Federal Insurance Supervisory Office. This formation provides uniform

national supervision of banks, insurance companies, brokers, stock

exchanges, credit institutions, and others. All German financial activity is

regulated under this umbrella.

```
France

```

The financial regulator in France is the Financial Markets Regulator

(Autorite des Marches Financiers). Among its responsibilities are to

safeguard investments in financial instruments and to maintain orderly

financial markets. Autorite des Marches Financiers falls under the European

regulatory authority of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive

(discussed in chapter 24).

```
Switzerland

```

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is responsible

for Swiss financial regulation. It supervises banks, stock exchanges,

securities dealers, and insurance companies. FINMA is responsible for two

- f the world's largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse. FINMA was founded
in June 2007 by merging other Swiss regulatory bodies.

```
Singapore

```

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank

and is responsible for financial regulation, power granted to it by the MAS

Act. In its capacity as financial regulator, it has the power to regulate and

supervise financial institutions. Frameworks and guidelines are provided by

MAS for various types of financial institutions.

```
Japan

```

The Japanese financial regulator is the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

According to its annual report, FSA is "responsible for (i) ensuring the

stability of the financial system; (ii) protecting the users of financial

instruments and services, such as depositors, insurance policy holders,

investors and the like; and (iii) facilitating the smooth function of financial

services." [13] The pertinent bureaus are the Planning & Coordination Bureau,

the Inspection Bureau, the Supervisory Bureau, Securities & Exchange

Surveillance Commission Executive Bureau, and the Certified Public

Accountants & Auditing Oversight Board Executive Division. Of particular

interest is Securities & Exchange Surveillance Commission Executive

Bureau, which is responsible for market "surveillance, inspection of

securities companies, investigation of market misconduct, inspection of

disclosure statements, investigation of criminal cases, etc." [14]

```
Other International Participants

```

Various entities provide direction, research, and advice to policymakers

throughout the world. Here we describe two important international entities:

the Bank for International Settlements and the Financial Stability Board.

```
Bank for International Settlements

```

An organization whose mission is to provide guidance to central banks in

pursuing monetary and financial stability, to foster international cooperation

in those areas, and to act as a bank for central banks is the Bank for

International Settlements (BIS), located in Basel, Switzerland. Two primary

- perational roles of the BIS are acting as a counterparty in transactions
between two central banks and serving as an agent or trustee in connection
with international financial operations. In its role of providing guidance to
policymakers of central banks, the BIS has four standing committees: (1)
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, (2) the Committee on the
Global Financial System, (3) the Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems, and (4) the Markets Committee. The objective of these
committees is to oversee the adoption of best practices by central banks as
they address the various issues they face.

The purpose of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is to

educate policymakers on the key issues associated with the supervision of

banks and by doing so to improve the quality of bank supervision

throughout the world. In chapter 6 we discuss risk-based capital

requirements for banks. These requirements are based on the various Basel

Accords produced by this committee. In addition, the committee formulated

a framework for identifying SIFIs, described earlier in this chapter. This

committee has four task forces that deal with implementation issues: the

Standards Implementation Group, the Policy Development Group, the

Accounting Task Force Group, and the Basel Consultative Group.

The mandate of the Committee on the Global Financial System is the

identification and assessment of potential sources of stress in global

financial markets. The objective is to aid policymakers in understanding the

structural underpinnings of financial markets so as to support central banks

in the fulfillment of their responsibilities for monetary and financial

stability. As an example of how it monitors markets to fulfill that purpose,

in July 2011, a work group of the committee published a paper that

examined "how insurance companies and pension funds are being affected

by forthcoming accounting and regulatory changes in the current lowinterest rate environment, and to investigate possible implications of

changes in their investment strategies for the financial system." [15]

A key component of the global financial system is how the financial

market infrastructure on payment and settlement systems deals with these

infrastructure issues and sets standards for them both for domestic

transactions and for cross-border and multicurrency settlement transactions.

Finally, the Markets Committee's purpose is to provide policy guidelines

for enhancing market transparency, discussion of developments in finance

markets, and an exchange of views on future developments that will have

an impact on financial markets. In addition, this committee provides a

forum for central bankers to discuss the specifics of their own market

- perations. The committee deals with topics relating to central banks'
practices with respect to the eligibility of collateral because of the integral
role of central banks in providing liquidity to the financial system on a dayto-day basis. The global crisis has highlighted the importance of this issue.

```
Supranational Organizations

```

A **supranational organization** is an entity created to promote economic

development for its member countries. Two examples of supranational

- rganizations are the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, popularly referred to as the World Bank, and the InterAmerican Development Bank. The general objective of the former is to
improve the efficiency of the international financial and trading markets.
The objective of the latter supranational is to promote economic growth in
the developing countries of the Americas.

```
Financial Stability Board

```

Another international body that monitors the global finance system and

makes policy recommendations to governments for enhancing the stability

- f financial institutions and financial markets is the Financial Stability
Board (FSB). Several of the FSB activities that are part of its mandate are to

- assess vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and identify and review on a timely and

Views on the Degree of Government Intervention in Financial

Markets

```

There are two contrasting views about the role of governments in financial

markets. The first view is that there should be large-scale government

interventions to solve problems that involve massive market failures. The

second view is that government intervention is the problem, not the

solution, and in fact may lead to market failures by implementing policies

that are not beneficial to financial markets.

In this debate on the degree of government intervention in financial

markets, Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic

Sciences, [17] provides a middle-of-the-road view. He identifies four recurrent

themes that have been observed about financial markets. [18] The first is that,

historically, the occurrence of modern capitalism is the link between

financial crises and economic recessions (e.g., the United States, Japan, and

European countries). The debate centers on the actions that governments

employ to minimize the risk of insolvency and ensure the stability of key

financial institutions.

Throughout this book, we will discuss important financial innovations

that have led to the creation of new financial instruments in the cash and

derivatives markets, new investment strategies, and new technologies for

implementing the trading of securities. These financial innovations may

necessitate a re-evaluation of the role of government intervention, which is

Stiglitz's second recurring theme.

The third recurrent theme is that as financial markets develop, there is

development of a more sophisticated financial system. A prominent aspect

- f this is the formation of new types of financial institutions. The question
is how governments should deal with the regulation of these entities.

Finally, as we will see in this book, there has been a pattern of regulation

followed by liberalization of certain financial markets (i.e., deregulation).

This, according to Stigliz, has been the dominant recurrent theme in policy

discussions about the role of governments in financial markets. The

deregulation of financial markets according to its proponents is that it

enables the financial system to more efficiently allocate capital, thereby

benefiting the economy.

Stiglitz disagrees with this view about the benefits of deregulation,

arguing that

the rationale for liberalizing financial markets is based neither on a sound economic understanding of

how these markets work nor on the potential scope for government intervention. Often, too, it lacks

an understanding of the historical events and political forces that have led governments to assume

their present role. Instead, it is based on an ideological commitment to an idealized conception of

markets that is grounded neither in fact nor in economic theory. [19]

Fundamentally, Stiglitz's view is one that is middle of the road. He

rightly argues that financial markets are different from other types of

markets, such as labor markets and nonfinancial product markets. And it is

in financial markets where one might expect the potential for more market

failures than in other types of markets. He argues that some forms of

government regulation can produce a financial system that can lower the

risk of market failure and then identifies those circumstances. However, he

argues that in some instances, government regulation (intervention) has

caused a major financial crisis. That is, market failure occurred due to

government failure, not market failure. The example of government failure

he identifies—and the one we mentioned earlier in this chapter—is the S&L

crisis.

Trump Administration’s View on Bank and Financial Regulation

```

On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order

identifying his "Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial

System." [20] These core principles are:

(a) empower Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the

marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth;

(b) prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts;

(c) foster economic growth and vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact

analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures, such as moral hazard and information

asymmetry;

(d) enable American companies to be competitive with foreign firms in domestic and foreign

markets;

(e) advance American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings;

(f) make regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored; and

(g) restore public accountability within Federal financial regulatory agencies and rationalize the

Federal financial regulatory framework.

```
Key Points

```

- A government's macroprudential policy seeks to reduce systemic risk.
   - A government's microprudential policy seeks to control the risks
associated with financial institutions. The interconnectedness of the

financial institutions is not relevant here.

   - Governments play various roles in the financial system: regulating
financial markets, including financial intermediaries participating in
the market; acting as financial intermediaries by making loans or
guaranteeing loans to sectors or groups of the economy that are
deemed to need assistance; influencing financial markets at the
macroeconomic level through the actions of their central banks; and
providing bailouts or financial assistance for market sectors or
corporations (financial and nonfinancial) during periods of market
turmoil or distress.

- A useful way to organize the many instances of financial regulation
is through four general forms: (1) regulation of disclosures, (2)
regulation of financial activities, (3) regulation of financial institutions,
and (4) regulation of foreign participants.

- A country's central bank is responsible for the financial matters of a
country, primarily through the implementation of monetary policy,
which is the set of tools that can be used to influence the economy and
financial system to achieve a country's economic objectives.

- In most countries, price stability is typically the dominant monetary
policy objective.

- Financial stability is concerned with avoiding an extreme event that
could impose potentially large costs on the financial system and the
real economy.

- Government bailouts result in the use of public or taxpayer funds to
provide financial support to prevent the failure of major industries,
financial institutions, corporations, and subnational entities viewed as
essential to a country's economy or financial system.

- Some policymakers argue that financial institutions or markets may
be "too big to fail" because of their interconnectedness with other
financial institutions and markets in the financial system, and that
allowing such entities to fail would cause market turmoil that would
adversely affect the real economy.

- Those who argue against the notion of institutions being too big to
fail point out the moral hazard (i.e., excess risk taking) introduced into
the financial system when the management of financial institutions
believes that the government will view the institutions as too essential
to the financial system and will not allow them to fail.

- A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a financial
institution that, in the view of regulators, is a large firm whose failure
would cause a financial crisis.

- The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides research,
education, and guidance for central bankers to help improve various

aspects of banking supervision, infrastructure market issues, and

financial stability policies.

   - The Financial Stability Board (FSB) monitors the global finance
system and makes policy recommendations to governments for
enhancing the stability of financial institutions and financial markets.

Learning Objectives

```

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the business of financial institutions;
   - the role of financial intermediaries;
   - the difference between direct and indirect investments;
   - how financial intermediaries transform the maturity of liabilities and
give both short-term depositors and longer-term, final borrowers what
they want;

   - how financial intermediaries offer investors diversification and so

reduce the risks of their investments;

   - the way financial intermediaries reduce the costs of acquiring
information and entering into contracts with final borrowers of funds;

   - how financial intermediaries enjoy economies of scale in processing
payments from final users of funds;

   - the nature of the management of assets and liabilities by financial
intermediaries;

   - how different financial institutions have differing degrees of
knowledge and certainty about the amount and timing of the cash

   - utlay of their liabilities;
   - why financial institutions have liquidity concerns;
   - the concerns that regulators have with financial institutions;
   - the general characteristics of asset management firms; and
   - the types of funds that asset management firms manage.

In this chapter, we discuss financial institutions and a special and important

type of financial institution, the financial intermediary. Financial

intermediaries include commercial banks, S&L associations, investment

companies, insurance companies, and pension funds. The most important

contribution of financial intermediaries is a steady and relatively

inexpensive flow of funds from savers to final users or investors. Every

modern economy has financial intermediaries, which perform key financial

functions for individuals, households, corporations, small and new

businesses, and governments. In the last part of this chapter, we provide an

- verview of asset management firm, organizations that manage funds for
financial intermediaries as well as individual investors.

```
Financial Institutions

```

Business entities include nonfinancial and financial enterprises.

Nonfinancial enterprises manufacture products (e.g., cars, steel, computers),

provide nonfinancial services (e.g., transportation, utilities, computer

services), or do both. Financial enterprises, more popularly referred to as

**financial institutions**, provide services related to one or more of the

following:

1. transforming financial assets acquired through the market and
converting them into a different and more widely preferable type of
asset; [1]

2. exchanging financial assets on behalf of customers;
3. exchanging financial assets for their own accounts;
4. assisting in the creation of financial assets for their customers, and
then selling those financial assets to other market participants;

5. providing investment advice to other market participants; and
6. managing the portfolios of other market participants.

Financial intermediaries include **depository institutions** (commercial

banks, S&L associations, savings banks, and credit unions), which acquire

the bulk of their funds by offering their liabilities to the public mostly in the

form of deposits; insurance companies (life and property and casualty

companies); pension funds; and finance companies. Deposit-accepting, or

depository institutions, are discussed in chapter 6.

The second and third services in the list above are the broker and dealer

functions, which are discussed in chapter 18. The fourth service is referred

to as underwriting. As we explain in chapter 9, typically a financial

institution that provides an underwriting service also provides a brokerage

- r dealer service.

Some nonfinancial enterprises have subsidiaries that provide financial

services. For example, many large manufacturing firms have subsidiaries

that provide financing for their parent company's customers. These

financial institutions are called **captive finance companies** . Examples

include General Motors Acceptance Corporation (a subsidiary of General

Motors) and General Electric Credit Corporation (a subsidiary of General

Electric).

```
Role of Financial Intermediaries

```

Financial intermediaries obtain funds by issuing financial claims against

themselves to market participants and then investing those funds. The

investments made by financial intermediaries—their assets—can be in the

form of loans, securities, or both. These investments are referred to as

**direct investments** . Market participants who hold the financial claims

issued by financial intermediaries are said to have made **indirect**

**investments** .

Two examples will illustrate this process. Most readers of this book are

familiar with what commercial banks do. **Commercial banks** accept

deposits and use the proceeds to lend funds to consumers and businesses.

The deposits represent the obligation of the commercial bank and a

financial asset owned by the depositor. The loan represents an obligation of

the borrowing entity and a financial asset of the commercial bank. The

commercial bank has made a direct investment in the borrowing entity; the

depositor effectively has made an indirect investment in that borrowing

entity.

As a second example, consider an **investment company**, a financial

intermediary we focus on in chapter 32, which pools the funds of market

participants and uses those funds to buy a portfolio of securities, such as

stocks and bonds. Investment companies are more commonly referred to as

"mutual funds." Investors providing funds to the investment company

receive an equity claim that entitles the investor to a pro rata share of the

- utcome of the portfolio. The equity claim is issued by the investment
company. The **portfolio** - f financial assets acquired by the investment
company represents a direct investment that it has made. By owning an
equity claim against the investment company, those who invest in the
investment company have made an indirect investment.

We have stressed that financial intermediaries play the basic role of

transforming financial assets that are less desirable for a large part of the

public into other financial assets—their own liabilities—which are more

widely preferred by the public. This transformation involves at least one of

four economic functions:

1. providing maturity intermediation,
2. reducing risk via diversification,
3. reducing the costs of contracting and information processing, and
4. providing a payments mechanism.

Each function is described below.

```
Providing Maturity Intermediation

```

Our example of the commercial bank has two notable features. First, the

maturity of at least a portion of the deposits accepted is typically short term.

For example, certain types of deposit are payable on demand. Others have a

specific maturity date, but most are less than two years. Second, the

maturity of the loans made by a commercial bank can be considerably

longer than two years. In the absence of a commercial bank, the borrower

would have to borrow for a shorter term or find an entity that is willing to

invest for the length of the loan sought, or the investors who make deposits

in the bank would have to commit funds for a longer length of time than

they want. The commercial bank, by issuing its own financial claims, in

essence transforms a longer-term asset into a shorter-term one by giving the

borrower a loan for the length of time sought and the investor/depositor a

financial asset for the desired investment horizon. This function of a

.

financial intermediary is called **maturity intermediation**

Maturity intermediation has two implications for financial markets.

First, it provides investors with more choices concerning maturity for their

investments; borrowers have more choices for the length of their debt

- bligations. Second, because investors are naturally reluctant to commit
funds for a long period of time, they will require that long-term borrowers
pay a higher interest rate than is required for short-term borrowing. A
financial intermediary is willing to make longer-term loans, and at a lower
cost to the borrower than an individual investor would, by counting on
successive deposits to provide the funds until maturity (although at some

risk—see below). Thus, the second implication is that the cost of longerterm borrowing is likely to be reduced.

```
Reducing Risk via Diversification

```

Consider the example of the investor who places funds in an investment

company. Suppose that the investment company invests the funds received

in the stock of a large number of companies. By doing so, the investment

company has diversified and reduced its risk.

Investors who have a small sum to invest would find it difficult to

achieve the same degree of diversification, because they do not have

sufficient funds to buy shares of a large number of companies. Yet by

investing in the investment company for the same sum of money, investors

can accomplish this diversification, thereby reducing risk.

This economic function of financial intermediaries—transforming more

risky assets into less risky ones—is called **diversification** . Although

individual investors can do it on their own, they may not be able to do it as

cost effectively as a financial intermediary, depending on the amount of

funds they have to invest. Attaining cost-effective diversification to reduce

risk by purchasing the financial assets of a financial intermediary is an

important economic benefit for financial markets.

```
Reducing the Costs of Contracting and Information Processing

```

Investors purchasing financial assets should take the time to develop the

skills necessary for understanding how to evaluate an investment. Once

those skills are developed, investors should apply them to the analysis of

specific financial assets that are candidates for purchase (or subsequent

sale). Investors who want to make a loan to a consumer or business will

need to write the loan contract (or hire an attorney to do so).

Although some people enjoy devoting leisure time to this task, most

prefer to use that time for just that—leisure. Most of us find that leisure

time is in short supply, so to sacrifice it, we have to be compensated. The

form of compensation could be a higher return that we obtain from an

investment.

In addition to the opportunity cost of the time to process the information

about the financial asset and its issuer, there is the cost of acquiring that

information. All these costs are called **information processing costs** . The

costs of writing loan contracts are referred to as **contracting costs** . There is

also another dimension to contracting costs: the cost of enforcing the terms

- f the loan agreement.

With this in mind, consider our two examples of financial intermediaries

- the commercial bank and the investment company. People who work for
these intermediaries include investment professionals who are trained to
analyze financial assets and manage them. In the case of loan agreements,
either standardized contracts can be prepared, or legal counsel can be part

- f the professional staff that writes contracts involving more complex
transactions. The investment professionals can monitor compliance with the
terms of the loan agreement and take any necessary action to protect the
interests of the financial intermediary. The employment of such
professionals is cost effective for financial intermediaries, because investing
funds is their normal business.

In other words, there are economies of scale in contracting and

processing information about financial assets because of the amount of

funds managed by financial intermediaries. The lower costs accrue to the

investor purchasing a financial claim of the financial intermediary and to

the issuers of financial assets, who benefit from a lower borrowing cost.

```
Providing a Payments Mechanism

```

Although the previous three economic functions may not have been

immediately obvious, this last function should be. Most transactions made

today are not done with cash. Instead, payments are made using checks,

credit cards, debit cards, and electronic transfers of funds. These methods

for making payments, called **payment mechanisms**, are provided by

certain financial intermediaries.

At one time, noncash payments were restricted to checks written against

noninterest-bearing accounts at commercial banks. Similar check writing

privileges were provided later by S&L associations and savings banks, and

by certain types of investment companies. Payment by credit card was also

at one time the exclusive domain of commercial banks, but now other

depository institutions offer this service. Debit cards are offered by various

financial intermediaries. A debit card differs from a credit card in that, in

the latter case, a bill is sent to the credit card holder periodically (usually

- nce a month) requesting payment for transactions made in the past. In the
case of a debit card, funds are immediately withdrawn (that is, debited)
from the purchaser's account at the time the transaction takes place.

The ability to make payments without the use of cash is critical for the

functioning of a financial market. In short, depository institutions transform

assets that cannot be used to make payments into other assets that offer that

property.

```
Overview of Asset/Liability Management for Financial

Institutions

```

In later chapters, we discuss the major financial institutions. To understand

the reasons managers of financial institutions invest in particular types of

financial assets and the types of investment strategies they employ, it is

necessary to have a general understanding of the asset/liability problem

faced. In this section, we provide an overview of **asset/liability**

.

**management**

The nature of the liabilities dictates the investment strategy that a

financial institution will pursue. For example, depository institutions seek to

generate income by the spread between the return that they earn on assets

and the cost of their funds. That is, they buy money and sell money. They

buy money by borrowing from depositors or other sources of funds. They

sell money when they lend it to businesses or individuals. In essence, they

are in the spread business—their objective is to sell money for more than it

costs to buy money.

The cost of the funds and the return on the funds sold is expressed in

terms of an interest rate per unit of time. Consequently, the objective of a

depository institution is to earn a positive **spread** between the assets it

invests in (what it has sold the money for) and the costs of its funds (what it

has purchased the money for).

Life insurance companies—and to a certain extent, property and casualty

insurance companies—are in the spread business. Pension funds are not in

the spread business: They do not raise funds themselves in the market. They

seek to cover the cost of pension obligations at a minimum cost that is

borne by the sponsor of the pension plan. Investment companies face no

explicit costs for the funds they acquire and must satisfy no specific liability

- bligations; one exception is a particular type of investment company that
agrees to repurchase shares at any time.

```
Nature of Liabilities

```

By the **liabilities** - f a financial institution, we mean the amount and timing

- f the cash outlays that must be made to satisfy the contractual terms of the
- bligations issued. The liabilities of any financial institution can be
categorized according to four types, as shown in table 3.1. The
categorization in the table assumes that the entity that must be paid the

- bligation will not cancel the financial institution's obligation prior to any
actual or projected payout date.

```
Table 3.1

```

Nature of liabilities of financial institutions.

Liability Type Amount of Cash Outlay Timing of Cash Outlay

Type I Known Known

Type II Known Uncertain

Type III Uncertain Known

Type IV Uncertain Uncertain

The descriptions of cash outlays as either known or uncertain are

undoubtedly broad. When we refer to a cash outlay as being uncertain, we

do not mean that it cannot be predicted. There are some liabilities where the

"law of large numbers" makes it easier to predict the timing or amount of

cash outlays. This is the work typically done by actuaries, but of course

even actuaries cannot predict natural catastrophes, such as floods and

earthquakes.

As we describe the various financial institutions in later chapters, keep

these risk categories in mind. For now, let's illustrate each one.

**`Type-I liabilities`** Both the amount and the timing of the liabilities are
known with certainty. A liability requiring a financial institution to pay \$5
million six months from now would be an example. For example,
depository institutions know the amount that they are committed to pay
(principal plus interest) on the maturity date of a fixed-rate deposit,
assuming that the depositor does not withdraw funds prior to the maturity
date.

Type-I liabilities, however, are not limited to depository institutions. A

major product sold by life insurance companies is a **guaranteed**

**investment contract**, popularly referred to as a **GIC** . The obligation of the

life insurance company under this contract is that, for a sum of money

(called a premium), it will guarantee an interest rate up to some specified

maturity date. [2] For example, suppose a life insurance company for a

premium of \$10 million issues a five-year GIC agreeing to pay 10%

compounded annually. The life insurance company knows that it must pay

\$16.11 million to the GIC policyholder in five years. [3]

**`Type-II liabilities`** The amount of cash outlay is known, but the timing

- f the cash outlay is uncertain. The most obvious example of a Type-II
liability is a life insurance policy. There are many types of life insurance
policies that we shall discuss in chapter 8, but the most basic type is that,
for an annual premium, a life insurance company agrees to make a specified
dollar payment to policy beneficiaries upon the death of the insured.

**`Type-III liabilities`** With this type of liability, the timing of the cash

- utlay is known, but the amount is uncertain. An example is when a
financial institution has issued an obligation in which the interest rate
adjusts periodically according to some interest rate benchmark. Depository
institutions, for example, issue accounts called **certificates of deposit**
**(CDs)**, which have a stated maturity. The interest rate paid need not be
fixed over the life of the deposit but can fluctuate. If a depository institution
issues a three-year floating-rate CD that adjusts every three months and the
interest rate paid is the three-month Treasury bill rate plus one percentage
point, the depository institution knows it has a liability that must be paid off

in three years, but the dollar amount of the liability is not known. It will

depend on three-month Treasury bill rates over the three years.

**`Type-IV`** **`liabilities`** Numerous insurance products and pension

- bligations present uncertainty as to both the amount and timing of the cash
- utlay. Probably the most obvious examples are automobile and home
insurance policies issued by property and casualty insurance companies.
When, and if, a payment will have to be made to the policyholder is
uncertain. Whenever damage is done to an insured asset, the amount of the
payment that must be made is uncertain.

As we explain in chapter 9, sponsors of pension plans can agree to

various types of pension obligations to the beneficiaries of the plan. There

are plans whose retirement benefits depend on the participant's income for a

specified number of years before retirement and the total number of years

the participant worked. This will affect the amount of the cash outlay. The

timing of the cash outlay depends on when the employee elects to retire and

whether the employee remains with the sponsoring plan until retirement.

Moreover, both the amount and the timing will depend on how the

employee elects to have payments made—over only the employee's life or

those of the employee and spouse.

```
Liquidity Concerns

```

Because of uncertainty about the timing or the amount of the cash outlays, a

financial institution must be prepared to have sufficient cash to satisfy its

- bligations. Also keep in mind that our discussion of liabilities assumes that
the entity holding the obligation against the financial institution may have
the right to change the nature of the obligation, perhaps incurring some
penalty. For example, in the case of a certificate of deposit, the depositor
may request the withdrawal of funds prior to the maturity date. Typically,
the deposit-accepting institution will grant this request but assess an early
withdrawal penalty. In the case of certain types of investment companies,
shareholders have the right to redeem their shares at any time.

Some life insurance products have a cash-surrender value: At specified

dates, the policyholder can exchange the policy for a lump-sum payment.

Typically, the lump-sum payment will penalize the policyholder for turning

in the policy. Some life insurance products have a loan value, which means

that the policyholder has the right to borrow against the cash value of the

policy.

In addition to uncertainty about the timing and amount of the cash

- utlays, and the potential for the depositor or policyholder to withdraw cash
early or borrow against a policy, a financial institution has to be concerned
with possible reduction in cash inflows. In the case of a depository
institution, this means the inability to obtain deposits. For insurance
companies, it means reduced premiums because of the cancellation of
policies. For certain types of investment companies, it means not being able
to find new buyers for shares.

```
Regulations

```

Numerous regulations and tax considerations influence the investment

policies that financial institutions pursue. When discussing the various

financial institutions in later chapters, we will highlight the key regulations

and tax factors.

In chapter 2, we discussed the role of the government in the regulation

- f financial markets. Here we provide a brief discussion of the risks that
regulators have regarding financial institutions. These risks, several of
which were described in the previous chapter, can be classified into the
following sources of risk:

credit risk,

settlement risk,

counterparty risk,

liquidity risk,

market risk,

   - perational risk, and

legal risk.

**Credit risk** is a broadly used term to describe several types of risk. In
terms of regulatory concerns, credit risk is the risk that the obligor of a
financial instrument held by a financial institution will fail to fulfill its

- bligation on the due date or at any time thereafter. According to the
International Financial Risk Institute, **settlement risk** is the risk that when
there is a settlement of a trade or obligation, the transfer fails to take place
as expected. Settlement risk consists of counterparty risk (a form of credit
risk) and a form of liquidity risk.

**Counterparty risk** is the risk that a counterparty in a trade fails to
satisfy its obligation. The trade could involve the cash settlement of a
contract or the physical delivery of some asset. In the context of settlement
risk, **liquidity risk** means that the counterparty can eventually meet its

- bligation, but not at the due date. As a result, the party failing to receive
timely payment must be prepared to finance any shortfall in the contractual

payment.

**Market risk** is the risk to a financial institution's economic well-being
that results from an adverse movement in the market price of assets (debt

- bligations, equities, commodities, currencies) it owns or the level or the
volatility of market prices. Measures can be used to gauge this risk. One
such measure endorsed by bank regulators is **value-at-risk** (VaR), a
measure of the potential loss in a financial institution's financial position
associated with an adverse price movement of a given probability over a
specified time horizon.

**Liquidity risk**, in addition to being a part of settlement risk, has two
forms, according to the International Financial Risk Institute. The first is the
risk that a financial institution is unable to transact in a financial instrument

.

at a price near its market value. This risk is called **market liquidity risk**

The other form of liquidity risk is **funding liquidity risk** . This is the risk

that the financial institution will be unable to obtain funding to obtain the

cash flow necessary to satisfy its obligations.

An important risk that is often overlooked but has been the cause of the

demise of some major financial institutions is operational risk. Well-known

examples in the past two decades include Orange County (1994, United

States), Barings Bank (1995, United Kingdom), Daiwa Bank (1995, New

York), Allied Irish Banks (2002, Ireland), Enron (2001, United States),

MasterCard International (2005, United States), and the terrorist attack in

New York on September 11, 2001. [4] **Operational risk** is defined by bank

regulators as "the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal

processes, people and systems, or from external events." [5] The definition of

- peration risk includes **legal risk** . This is the risk of loss resulting from
failure to comply with laws as well as prudent ethical standards and
contractual obligations.

We will continue our discussion of the risks that financial institutions

face and guidelines for dealing with them when we discuss depository

institutions in chapter 6.

```
Asset Management Firms

```

Asset management firms manage the funds of individuals, businesses,

endowments, foundations, and state and local governments. These firms are

also referred to as **money management firms**, and those who manage the

funds are referred to as **asset managers**, **money managers**, **fund**

**managers**, and **portfolio managers** .

Asset management firms are either affiliated with some financial

institution (such as a commercial bank, insurance company, or investment

bank) or are independent companies. Larger institutional clients seeking the

services of an asset management firm typically do not allocate all of their

assets to one asset management firm. Instead, they typically diversify

among several asset management firms, as well as possibly managing some

portion of their funds internally. One reason for using several asset

management firms is that firms differ in their expertise with respect to asset

classes. For example, a client that seeks an asset manager to invest in

common stock, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments (such as

commodities and hedge funds) will use asset management firms that

specialize in each of those asset classes.

As of January 2018, the largest asset management firm in the world is

BlackRock with \$6.2 trillion in assets under management, followed by the

Vanguard Group (\$4.9 trillion). Other asset management firms with more

than \$2 trillion in assets under management are UBS (\$3.1 trillion), State

Street Global Advisors (\$2.8 trillion), Fidelity Investments (\$2.4 trillion),

and Allianz Asset Management (\$2.3 trillion). [6] Of these six firms, four are

U.S. based and two are European based—UBS (Switzerland) and Allianz

Asset Management (Germany).

Asset management firms receive their compensation primarily from

management fees charged based on the market value of the assets managed

for clients. For example, if an asset manager manages \$100 million for a

client and the fee is 60 basis points, then the annual dollar management fee

is $600,000 ($100 million × 0.0060). Management fees typically vary with

the amount managed, the complexity of managing the asset class, whether

the assets are actively managed or passively managed, and whether the

account is an institutional account or individual account. Moreover, the

management fee is typically higher for managing the assets of regulated

investment companies than for other institutional clients.

Although performance fees are common for hedge funds, which we

discuss in chapter 32, asset management firms are increasingly adopting

**performance-based management fees** for other types of accounts. [7] Many

types of performance-fee structures are used in the asset management

industry. The fee can be based solely on performance or on a combination

- f a fixed fee based on assets managed plus a performance-based fee. An
example of the latter is a fee structure whereby the asset manager receives
80 basis points of the assets managed plus a fee of 20% of the return earned

- n those assets. The criterion for determining a performance-based fee
varies. For example, the fee can be based on any positive return, the excess

- ver a minimum return established by the client, or the excess over a
benchmark (i.e., some index for the asset class) established by the client.

Types of funds managed by asset management firms include:

regulated investment companies,

insurance company funds,

separately managed accounts for individuals and institutional

investors,

pension funds, and

hedge funds.

Asset management firms typically are involved in managing the assets

- f several of the above.

```
Key Points

```

- Financial institutions provide various types of financial services.
- Financial intermediaries are a special group of financial institutions that
- btain funds by issuing claims to market participants and use these funds to
purchase financial assets. Intermediaries transform funds they acquire into
assets that are more attractive to the public.

- Financial intermediaries do one or more of the following: (1) provide
maturity intermediation, (2) provide risk reduction via diversification at
lower cost, (3) reduce the cost of contracting and information processing, or
(4) provide a payments mechanism.

- The nature of their liabilities, as well as regulatory and tax considerations,
determine the investment strategy pursued by all financial institutions.

- The liabilities of all financial institutions will generally fall in different
categories based on the degree of certainty of the amount and timing of the
liability.

- The sources of risk of concern to regulators in their regulation of financial
institutions include credit risk, settlement risk, market risk, liquidity risk,

- perational risk, and legal risk.
- Several reports by regulators have recommended guidelines for
controlling the risks of financial institutions.

- Asset management firms are involved in the management of funds for
individuals, businesses, state and local government entities, and
endowments and foundations.

- Asset managers generate income from fees based on the market value of
the assets they manage, on performance fees, or on both.

Questions

```

1. Why is the holding of a claim on a financial intermediary by an investor
considered an indirect investment in another entity?

2. The Insightful Management Company sells financial advice to investors.
This is the only service provided by the company. Is this company a

financial intermediary? Explain your answer.

3. Explain how a financial intermediary reduces the cost of contracting and
information processing.

4. "All financial intermediaries provide the same economic functions.
Therefore, the same investment strategy should be used in the management

- f all financial intermediaries." Indicate whether you agree or disagree with
this statement. Explain your answer.

5. A bank issues an obligation to depositors in which it agrees to pay 3%
guaranteed for one year. With the funds it obtains, the bank can invest in a
wide range of financial assets. What is the risk if the bank uses the funds to
invest in common stock?

6. Look at table 3.1 again. Match the types of liabilities to these four assets
that an individual might have:

a. car insurance policy

b. variable-rate certificate of deposit

c. fixed-rate certificate of deposit

d. a life insurance policy that allows the holder's beneficiary to receive

\$100,000 when the holder dies; however, if the death is accidental, the

beneficiary will receive \$150,000

7. Each year, millions of American investors pour billions of dollars into
investment companies, which use those dollars to buy the common stock of

- ther companies. What do the investment companies offer investors who
prefer to invest in the investment companies rather than buying the common
stock of these other companies directly?

8. In March 1996, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of
the BIS published a report titled "Settlement Risk in Foreign Exchange
Transactions" that offers a practical approach that banks can employ when
dealing with settlement risk. What is meant by "settlement risk"?

9. The following appeared in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's
_Economic Letter_, January 25, 2002:

Financial institutions are in the business of risk management and reallocation, and they have

developed sophisticated risk management systems to carry out these tasks. The basic components of

a risk management system are identifying and defining the risks the firm is exposed to, assessing

their magnitude, mitigating them using a variety of procedures, and setting aside capital for potential

losses. Over the past twenty years or so, financial institutions have been using economic modeling in

earnest to assist them in these tasks. For example, the development of empirical models of financial

volatility led to increased modeling of market risk, which is the risk arising from the fluctuations of

financial asset prices. In the area of credit risk, models have recently been developed for large-scale

credit risk management purposes.

Yet, not all of the risks faced by financial institutions can be so easily categorized and modeled. For

example, the risks of electrical failures or employee fraud do not lend themselves as readily to

modeling.

What type of risk is the above quotation referring to?

10. What is the source of income for an asset management firm?
11. What is meant by a performance-based management fee, and what is
the basis for determining performance in such an arrangement?

12. The transformed assets then become the financial institution's liability. This is the function
performed by financial intermediaries, the most important type of financial institution.

13. A GIC does not seem like a product that we would associate with a life insurance company,
because the policyholder does not have to die for someone to be paid. Yet as we shall see when we
discuss life insurance companies in chapter 8, a major group of insurance company financial products
is in the pension benefit area. A GIC is one such product.
14. This amount is determined as follows: \$10,000,000 × (1.10) [5] .
15. For a description of each of these examples, see chapter 1 in Anna Chernobai, Svetlozar T.
Rachev, and Frank J. Fabozzi, _Operational Risk: A Guide to Basel II Capital Requirements, Models_
_and Analysis_ (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2007).

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - who the private market participants in financial markets are;
   - the role of households in the financial system and the types of risks
they bear;

   - how nonfinancial corporations participate in the financial market;
   - what depository institutions and insurance companies are;
  - what a pension fund is and the types of pension plans offered
throughout the world;

   - what a defined benefit pension plan is and how it differs from a
defined contribution plan;

   - the variations of the basic defined benefit plans;
   - the reasons for the shift in preference in the private sector for
defined contribution plans over defined benefit plans;

   - the role of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA);

  - what nonprofit organizations are and the types of nonprofit
   - rganizations;
   - how foreign investors participate in a country's financial market;
   - how central banks and supranational institutions act as foreign
investors in a country's financial market; and

   - the difference between foreign direct investments and portfolio
investments.

In chapter 2, we discussed the government's role as a participant in the

financial markets, and in chapter 3, we described how financial institutions

and asset managers participate in the financial system. In this chapter, we

describe other private market participants in financial markets. These

players include the entities that issue financial assets and the entities that

invest in financial assets. This chapter provides only an overview and

leaves the details about particular players in the chapters to follow in this

part of the book. We then focus on two particular financial institutions in

chapters 6, 7, and 8. Chapters 6 and 7 cover depository institutions, and

chapter 8 focuses on insurance companies. Another important market

participant in the credit markets are credit rating agencies, the three most

popular being Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, and Standard &

Poor's. Because of their importance, we devote the next chapter to them.

```
Households

```

In chapter 1, we distinguished between the real economy and the paper

(financial) sector of the economy. Households, along with nonfinancial

corporations, are part of the real economy. For this reason, households play

a key role in a country's economy. Through their investment of funds and

through borrowing, households play a key role in the financial sector. Their

savings and spending decisions affect asset prices and interest rates.

The balance sheet of a household has three components: (1) assets, (2)

liabilities, and (3) equity or new worth. When households save, they use

those funds to invest in financial assets. The asset side of the balance sheet

- f households can be divided into two components: assets invested in
pension accounts and assets invested in nonpension accounts. As savers,
then, households are investors. The investment made may be a direct or an
indirect investment. An example of the former is a household's purchase of
Apple Inc. stock or corporate bond. Indirect investments include collective
investment vehicles and investments made through financial intermediaries,
both of which are described in chapter 32.

Households are also issuers of debt obligations in the financial market.

They do so when they borrow funds to finance consumer purchases on

credit, purchase a home by borrowing funds, or obtain a student loan to pay

for higher education. Those obligations appear on the balance sheet of

households as liabilities. Finally, the difference between assets and

liabilities is a household's net worth.

The behavior of households in the financial market is affected by

government policies, such as tax policies that may provide a favorable tax

treatment for certain types of investments and monetary policy, as we

describe in chapter 7. When interest rates are altered by monetary policy,

this action influences households in three ways. First, it affects the

decisions of households as to how much to save and how much to consume.

That is, a decline in interest rates has the effect of increasing consumption

and therefore reducing saving; an increase in interest rates has the effect of

decreasing consumption and increasing saving. Second, on the investment

side, it affects the asset allocation of households between noninterestbearing assets and interest-bearing assets. Finally, with respect to issuing

debt (i.e., borrowing), it increases the amount borrowed when interest rates

are lowered and decreases it when interest rates are increased.

The change in asset values also influences the behavior of households

through what is termed the "wealth effect." As the portfolio value of the

financial assets of households changes, households' net worth will also

change. The change in net worth affects the amount a household is willing

to borrow. More specifically, as net worth increases (decreases), households

have more (less) collateral that can be used in a borrowing arrangement.

Households are the ultimate bearers of financial risk in the financial

system. Although there are financial institutions and government programs

that provide different forms of guarantees for the financial products that

they issue, if the guarantors fail to fulfill their obligation, the risk is borne

by households. On the issuance/liability side, as borrowers, households are

a source of considerable credit risk in the financial system. Some loans by

households are guaranteed by the central governments, agencies that they

create, or subgovernment entities.

```
Nonfinancial Corporations

```

Nonfarm corporations are classified as financial corporations or

nonfinancial corporations. **Financial corporations** include depository

institutions, insurance companies, and investment companies. **Nonfinancial**

**corporations** issue securities. They issue both common stock and debt

- bligations. In addition, corporations with excess cash to invest participate
in financial markets by investing those funds on a short-term basis.

Some nonfinancial corporations have subsidiaries that are involved in

the same activities as financial corporations and are referred to as **captive**

**finance companies** . Three examples of U.S. captive finance companies are

Ford Motor Credit (a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company) and General

Electric Credit Corporation (a subsidiary of General Electric Company),

and Caterpillar Finance Corporation (a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.). Many

- f the larger U.S. nonfinancial corporations have non-U.S. captive

companies. For example, Ford Motor Company has Ford Credit Europe

Bank Plc, Ford Capital B.V., Ford Credit Canada Ltd., Ford Credit Australia

Ltd, Ford Credit de Mexico, Ford Credit Co. S.A. de C.V., Ford Motor

Credit Co. of New Zealand Ltd. and Ford Motor Credit Co. of Puerto Rico.

Hyundai Capital Services, a subsidiary of South Korea's Hyundai Motor

Company, provides a wide range of financial products and services.

Hyundai Motor Company has subsidiaries in other countries that are captive

finance companies. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is Hyundai

Capital UK Limited (a joint venture company established between

Santander Consumer UK), Hyundai Motor UK, and Kia Motors UK.

Corporations make available various types of pension plans for their

employees. In the case of defined benefit pension plans sponsored by

corporations, the sponsor has the same choices as those of state and local

governments that sponsor such plans: internal management, external

management, or a combination of both.

```
Depository Institutions

```

Depository institutions include commercial banks, S&L associations,

savings banks, and credit unions. Basically, with the funds that depository

institutions raise through deposits and other funding sources, they make

direct loans to individuals, nonfinancial and financial businesses, and state

and local governments. They generate a profit, as explained in chapter 3, by

earning a spread between the return realized on their investment and the

cost of obtaining funds. Because of their important role in financial

markets, they are highly regulated, and we devote chapter 6 to them.

```
Insurance Companies

```

**Insurance companies** provide insurance protection against the occurrence

- f future events that will adversely affect the insured and are therefore risk
bearers. For providing this protection (i.e., accepting the associated risk),
they receive an insurance premium. Between the time the insurance
premium is paid to the insurance company and the time the company pays

- ut claims to policyholders, the company can invest the premium in the
financial market.

Insurance companies sell both investment-oriented and pure insurance

products. The types of pure insurance products, and how they are classified

in the insurance industry, are life insurance, health insurance, property and

casualty insurance, liability insurance, disability insurance, and long-term

care insurance. Certain insurance companies provide protection in the form

- f financial guarantees. The major participants in the financial system
among the different types of insurance companies are life insurance
companies. Although life insurance companies are risk bearers, there are
some products they issue that are investment products. We devote chapter 8
to insurance companies.

```
Investment Companies

```

Investment companies are financial intermediaries that sell shares to the

public and invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of financial assets.

Each share represents a proportional interest in the net assets in which the

funds are invested. Because the primary regulator of investment companies

is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), these companies are

referred to as **registered investment companies** . Investment companies are

divided into open-end companies and closed-end companies. While both

types of investment companies are popularly referred to as "mutual funds,"

technically only open-end funds are mutual funds.

Investment companies are collective investment vehicles and are

described in more detail in chapter 32.

```
Private Pension Funds

```

A pension fund is established for the purpose of providing benefits on

retirement for designated groups of employees or professionals. The fund's

pool of assets is purchased with the contributions to the pension plan for the

exclusive purpose of financing pension plan benefits. The members of the

pension fund or pension plan have a legal or beneficial right or some other

form contractual claim against the pool of assets. A **pension plan sponsor**

is the entity that designs, negotiates, and typically helps administer a

pension plan for its members. A **private pension fund** is administered by

an institution other than a government entity.

Many countries have created vehicles for their citizens to save funds in a

pension plan in order to complement their private savings when they retire.

Pension plans can be employee (occupational) vehicles or pension vehicles.

The vehicles can be a pension fund, a pension insurance contract, or a

product created by a bank of an investment company.

An **occupational pension plan** is linked to an employment or

professional relationship between the plan member and the entity that

establishes the plan (the plan sponsor). These plans are established by

employers or groups of employers in the same industry (i.e., industry

associations), professional associations, and labor associations. A pension

plan that is not an occupational pension plan is a referred to as a **personal**

**pension plan** . Some countries, such as the United States, have both types of

pension plans, but others have only one type of plan.

Different private pension vehicles can be used to provide a pension. The

three major ones are pension funds, pension insurance contracts, and book

reserves.

A book reserves pension vehicle is one in which employers put money

aside for their employees' retirement on their books. This type private

pension vehicle exists in Germany.

For the private pension sector, there are pension insurance contracts,

which we will discuss. For some countries, the largest ratio of pensionrelated assets to gross domestic product (GDP) is the largest part of private

pension investments. In Denmark, where specialized insurance companies

hold pension-related assets, the ratio is 67%.

To appreciate the importance of pension vehicles as investors in

financial markets, a study by the OECD reported that the assets invested in

2015 by 35 OECD countries was US\$39.6 trillion. In a survey of 45 nonOECD countries, the amount invested that same year was \$1.3 trillion. In

terms of investor share, pension vehicles were first, followed by depository

institutions, investment companies, and insurance companies.

In terms of U.S. dollars, the five countries with the largest private

pension fund total investment in 2015, accounting for 85% of total

investments by OECD countries, were the United States, the United

Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and the Netherlands. The number of pension

funds varies greatly by country. For OECD countries, the five countries

with the largest number of pension funds in 2015 were the United States

(685,203), Australia (559,547), Ireland (67,840), the United Kingdom

(43,690), and Canada (8,876).

```
The U.S. Private Pension System

```

In this section we look at the U.S. private pension system. The appendix to

this chapter provides more information about the U.S. private pension

system.

**`Individual retirement accounts`** An **individual retirement account**

(IRA) is a tax-advantaged investment account that allows individuals to

invest to accumulate retirement funds. The tax advantage of a qualified plan

is that investment income (i.e., capital gains, dividends, and interest) is not

taxed until funds are withdrawn. There is another tax advantage, depending

- n the type of IRA, whether traditional or Roth. In a **traditional IRA**, the
amount invested (the maximum being specified by law) is deducted from
taxable income for the year of the contribution. Thus, the individual is
investing pre-tax income. When the funds are withdrawn by the individual,

- rdinary income, not capital gains, taxes are paid on the entire amount
withdrawn. With a **Roth IRA**, the amount invested is not deducted from
taxable income in the year contributed (i.e., the individual is investing aftertax income). Because taxes are paid on the amount invested, when the funds
are withdrawn, no tax is paid on the amount that was invested or earned (no
taxes at all).

The allocation of the funds in the IRA is determined by the individual.

All of the financial risks are assumed by the individual. Funds can be

allocated to individual stocks or bonds or invested in one of the collective

investment vehicles described later.

**`Defined benefit plans`** With a **defined benefit plan**, the plan sponsor
agrees to pay qualified employees covered by the plan benefits on
retirement. The amount of the retirement benefit is determined by a formula
that is based on a percentage of earnings and the number of years

employed. The plan sponsor can be a single corporation; a union or a group

- f corporations, usually in a related industry; or a government entity.

Corporate-sponsored plans are referred to as **private plans**, whereas

government-sponsored plans are referred to as **public plans** . Defined

benefit plans sponsored by a union or a group of corporations are referred to

as

**Taft-Hartley multiemployer plans** . Defined benefit plans may be

managed by the sponsor internally (i.e., with a portfolio management team

composed of employees of the plan sponsor) or by an external asset

management firm.

The liabilities of the pension plan are then those of the plan sponsor. So,

for example, the obligations of General Electric's defined benefit plan are

the liabilities of General Electric. From the employee's perspective, the

financial risk associated with the future payments of a defined benefit plan

are those of the sponsor. However, sponsors are corporations and state and

local governments, and such entities can go into bankruptcy. For qualified

private defined benefit plans, a federal government agency, the Pension

Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), insures those plans. However, the

PBGC's guarantee is not a guarantee by the U.S. government. Moreover,

the likelihood is that without a bailout, the PBGC will not have sufficient

funds to pay off the obligations that it has insured. This supports what was

stated when we described households: The household is the ultimate risk

bearer.

The number of U.S. defined benefit plans has been declining, as it has

been in other countries. In 2011, of all private sector establishments that

could sponsor a defined benefit plan, only 10% did so. Those private-sector

defined benefit plans covered only 18% of workers in the private sector. In

contrast to the private sector, state and local governments (i.e., public plans)

covered 78% of their employees. [1] Not only is the number of plan sponsors

in the private sector decreasing, but those corporations that had defined

benefit plans are closing them to new employees. For example, General

Electric announced in December 2010 that it was closing its defined benefit

plan to new employees. Instead, employees would be given a different plan,

the one we discuss next.

**`Defined contribution plans`** In a **defined contribution plan**, the plan
sponsor is responsible only for making specified contributions to the plan

- n behalf of qualifying participants, not specified payments to the employee
after retirement. The amount contributed is typically either a percentage of
the employee's salary or a percentage of the employer's profits. The plan
sponsor does not guarantee any specific amount at retirement. The
payments that will be made to qualifying participants on retirement depend

- n the growth of the plan assets. That is, retirement benefit payments are
determined by the investment performance of the funds in which the assets
are invested and are not guaranteed by the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor
gives the participants various options as to the investment vehicles in which
they may invest. Defined contribution pension plans come in several legal
forms: 401(k) plans, money purchase pension plans, and employee stock

- wnership plans (ESOPs).

By far the fastest-growing sector of the defined contribution plan is the

401(k) plan or its equivalent in the nonprofit sector, the 403(b) plan, and in

the public sector, the 457 plan. To the firm, this kind of plan offers the

lowest costs and the fewest administrative problems. The employer makes a

specified contribution to a specific plan or program, and the employee

chooses how it is invested. [2] To the employee, the plan is attractive because

it offers some control over how the pension money is managed. In fact, plan

sponsors frequently offer participants the opportunity to invest in one or

more families of mutual funds. More than half of all defined contribution

plans offered by public institutions (such as state governments) use mutual

funds, and the percentage of private corporations that use this approach is

even higher.

Employees in the corporate, as well as the public, sector have responded

favorably with almost half of all assets in defined contribution pensions

now invested in mutual funds. Regulations issued by the U.S. Department

- f Labor require firms to offer their employees a set of distinctive choices, a
development that has further encouraged pension plans to opt for the mutual
fund approach, because families of mutual funds can readily provide
investment vehicles offering different investment objectives.

Several fundamental differences separate defined benefit plans from

defined contribution plans. In the defined benefit plan, the plan sponsor

guarantees the retirement benefits, makes the investment choices, and bears

the investment risk if the investments do not earn enough to fund the

guaranteed retirement benefits. In a defined contribution plan, by contrast,

the employer does not guarantee any retirement benefits but does agree to

make specified contributions to the employee's account; the employee

selects the investment options, and the employee's retirement payments

come from the return on the investment portfolio, plus, of course, the

employee and employer contributions.

Nonprofit Organizations

```

Nongovernmental entities can be classified as commercial enterprises or

nonprofit (or not-for-profit) organizations. The distinction between the two

entities is that commercial enterprises have as their primary objective the

generation of a profit. **Nonprofit organizations** are not motivated by profit

- r any monetary gain but have as their primary objective financially
supporting or actively engaging in activities that will benefit some specific
public or private interest, such as humanitarian aid, education, the arts, or
religion.

Nonprofit organizations include **foundations** and **endowments** . There

are differences between the two regarding the requirements necessary for

the tax-exempt treatment of income generated from their investment funds.

But the main difference between these two types of nonprofit organizations

is that foundations are established with funds by a donor and no additional

funds are added, whereas an endowment can continue to raise funds from

the public on an ongoing basis. Foundations are established by wealthy

individuals and families. Some foundations are company sponsored or

linked to certain communities. Still others are termed **operating**

**foundations**, because they award most of their gifts to their own units

rather than to organizations outside the foundation. Endowment funds are

commonly established by colleges and universities, hospitals, and religious

- rganizations.

The five wealthiest foundations, corporate foundations, and community

foundations are the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in the United States

(endowment of about US\$45 billion), the Wellcome Trust in the United

Kingdom States (US\$27 billion), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in

the United States (US\$18 billion), the Garfield Weston Foundation in the

United Kingdom (about US\$16 billion), and the Stitchting INGKA

Foundation in the Netherlands (about US\$13 billion). The five universities

with the largest endowments are Harvard (endowment of about US\$38

billion), Yale (about US\$26 billion), Princeton (about US\$24 billion),

Stanford (about US\$23 billion), and the Massachusetts Institute of

Technology (US\$14 billion).

The board of trustees of the foundation or endowment specifies the

investment objectives and the acceptable investment alternatives. The funds

can be managed either in house or by external fund managers. Several

universities with large endowments have formed their own asset

management firms. For example, in 1974, Harvard University, the largest

university endowment fund, formed Harvard Management Company to

manage its endowment and related financial assets with the singular

mission of producing "long-term investment results to support the

educational and research goals of the University." [3]

```
Foreign Investors

```

Foreign investors that participate a country's financial market include

individuals, nonfinancial businesses, and financial entities that are not

domiciled in that country, as well as foreign central governments,

supranationals, and sovereign wealth funds. Two types of investments can

be made by foreign entities: foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio

investments.

The OECD defines a **foreign direct investment** (FDI) as follows:

FDI is defined as cross-border investment by a resident entity in one economy with the objective of

- btaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy. The lasting interest implies
the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a
significant degree of influence by the direct investor on the management of the enterprise. Ownership

- f at least 10% of the voting power, representing the influence by the investor, is the basic criterion
used. [4]

In contrast to an FDI, a **foreign portfolio investment** (FPI) is of a more

temporary nature. Investment instruments, such as stocks and bonds, are

normally traded in FPIs.

Central banks, supranationals, and sovereign wealth funds may

participate in a country's financial market. A central bank may participate

in another country's financial market through its central bank; we describe

the role of central banks in chapter 7. A central bank participates by buying

- r selling financial assets in another country's financial market either to
stabilize that country's currency relative to its domestic currency or as an
investment vehicle (buying if an asset is perceived to be attractive and
selling if a holding is perceived to be unattractive).

A **supranational institution** is an organization formed by two or more

central governments through international treaties. These supranational

institutions promote economic development for their member countries.

Two examples of supranational institutions are the International Bank for

Reconstruction and Development, popularly referred to as the World Bank,

and the Inter-American Development Bank. The general objective of the

former is to improve the efficiency of the international financial and trading

markets. The objective of the latter is to promote economic growth in the

developing countries of the Americas.

**Sovereign wealth funds** (SWFs) are countryor state-owned investment
funds that countries establish. The funds for an SWF are obtained from

proceeds from one or more of the following sources: (1) exports of natural

resources, (2) privatizations of previously state-owned companies or

enterprises, (3) government fiscal surpluses, (4) balance-of-payment

surpluses, and (5) earnings from official foreign currency operations. Of

course, the primary motive given for the establishment of an SWF has been

to maximize returns available from investments outside the country that has

established the SWF.

Since the establishment of the first SWF by Kuwait in 1953 (the Kuwait

Investment Authority), motivated by that government's objective to protect

the national standard of living from fluctuations in the price of its primary

export (oil), the twenty-first century has seen significant growth in the

number of SWFs. There are two reasons for the growth in the number and

amount of assets accumulated by SWFs. The first is the commodity price

boom in countries where either the government controls the exports or

heavy taxes are imposed on the revenues received from such exports. The

second reason is that the governments of many emerging market countries

have run persistent current account surpluses greater than needed, thereby

accumulating large stockpiles of international reserves with the intent of

investing them in high-yield assets outside their country. [5]

According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the five largest

SWFs, based on assets under management as of June 2016, were Norway's

Government Pension Fund (\$873 billion), China’s China Investment

Corporation (\$814 billion), the UAE's Abu Dhabi Investment Authority

(\$792 billion), Kuwait’s Kuwait Investment Authority (\$592 billion), and

Saudi Arabia's SAMA Foreign Holdings (\$582 billion). [6]

The increase in the number of SWFs and their expanded role have

prompted considerable debate as to the motives of these investment funds

beyond that of enhanced return performance in several countries and the

implications for the national security of countries where SWFs invest. One

concern is that some SWFs have invested in technology companies that

produce strategic military technology, allowing the SWFs to potentially

- btain trade secrets. Another is that SWFs may hold a major interest in
commercial enterprises of national concerns beyond the military sector.
Because of the lack of transparency in SWF operations, some governments
are concerned about such noncommercial motivations of SWFs. Yet the

potential capital injections that can be provided to some essential industries

in some countries appear to override any national security concerns. [7]

Key Points

```

- In addition to financial institutions, private market participants include
households, nonfinancial corporations, depository institutions, insurance
companies, nonprofit organizations, and foreign investors.

- Households are investors and debt issuers in the financial market whose

behavior is influenced by interest rates and asset values.

- Households are a source of financial risk as borrowers and are the

ultimate risk bearers as investors.

- Nonfarm corporations are classified as financial corporations or
nonfinancial corporations.

- Some nonfinancial corporations have subsidiaries that are captive finance
companies that are involved in the same activities as financial corporations.

- Insurance companies are risk bearers, with the largest sector in this
industry being life insurance companies.

- Employer-sponsored pension plans are pension plans established by
private entities (corporations) and public entities (state and local
governments).

- Employer-sponsored pension plans can be either defined benefit or
defined contribution plans.

- Defined benefit plans result in liabilities for the plan sponsor, and the
management of those funds is the responsibility of the plan sponsor.

- For defined contribution plans, once contributions are made, the plan
sponsor no longer has any liability, and plan participants make their own
investment decisions.

- In the private sector, government regulation and the portability of pension
funds have resulted in a decline in defined benefit plans in favor of defined
contribution plans.

- In the public sector, defined benefit plans dominate.
- The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is the federal
government agency responsible for protecting the retirement benefits of
workers of qualified private employer-sponsored defined benefit plans.

- The guarantee of the PBGC does not carry the guarantee of the U.S.

government.

- Foreign investors who participate in a country's financial market include
individuals, nonfinancial businesses and financial entities that are not
domiciled in that country, as well as foreign central governments,
supranationals, and sovereign wealth funds (SWFs).

- Foreign direct investments (FDIs) and foreign portfolio investments are
the two ways in which investors can participate in the financial market.

- Central governments participate in the financial market of another
country through their central bank's purchase and sale of that country's
financial assets.

Appendix: U.S. Pension Regulations and Issues

U.S. Pension Fund Regulation

```

The U.S. Congress passed comprehensive legislation in 1974 to regulate

pension plans. This legislation, **the Employee Retirement Income**

**Security Act of 1974** (ERISA), is fairly technical in its details. For our

purposes, it is necessary only to understand its major provisions.

First, ERISA established **funding standards** for the minimum

contributions that a plan sponsor must make to the pension plan to satisfy

the actuarially projected benefit payments.

Prior to the enactment of ERISA, many corporate plan sponsors

followed a pay-as-you-go funding policy. That is, when an employee

retired, the corporate plan sponsor took the necessary retirement benefits

- ut of current cash flow. Under ERISA, such a practice is no longer
allowed. Instead, the program must be funded; that is, regular contributions
to an investment pool along with investment earnings must be sufficient to
pay the employee retirement benefits.

Second, ERISA established **fiduciary standards** for pension fund

trustees, managers, or advisers. Specifically, all parties responsible for the

management of a pension fund are guided by the judgment of what is called

a "prudent man" in seeking to determine which investments are proper.

Because a trustee is responsible for other people's money, it is necessary to

ensure that the trustee takes the role seriously. To fulfill their

responsibilities, trustees must act as reasonably prudent persons to acquire

and use the information pertinent to making an investment decision.

Third, ERISA establishes minimum **vesting standards** . For example,

the law specifies that, after five years of employment, a plan participant is

entitled to 25% of accrued pension benefits. The percentage of entitlement

increases to 100% after 10 years. Additional vesting requirements are noted

in ERISA. Finally, ERISA created the PBGC to insure vested pension

benefits. The insurance program is funded from annual premiums that must

be paid by pension plans. We'll have more to say about the PBGC shortly.

Responsibility for administering ERISA is delegated to the Department

- f Labor and the Internal Revenue Service. To ensure that a pension plan is
in compliance with ERISA, periodic reporting and disclosure statements
must be filed with these government agencies. It is important to recognize
that ERISA does not require that a corporation establish a pension plan. If a

corporation does establish a defined benefit plan, however, it must comply

with the numerous and complex regulations set forth in ERISA.

```
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation

```

The U.S. government agency responsible for protecting the retirement

benefits of workers of qualified private employer-sponsored defined benefit

plans is the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Two separate insurance

programs are under the PBGC's purview: single-employer and

multiemployer plan insurance programs.

Created in 1974 as part of ERISA, PBGC has a threefold mission: (1) to

encourage the continuation and maintenance of private-sector defined

benefit plans, (2) to provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension

benefits, and (3) to keep pension insurance premiums at a minimum. By

law, the PBGC must be self-financed. Moreover, as noted in the annual

report of the PBGC, ERISA specifies "that the U.S. government is not

liable for any obligation or liability incurred by PBGC." This point is

critical, because if the PBGC fails, the workers whose pension it guarantees

no longer have a guarantee.

Although the federal government does not stand behind the PBGC's

- bligations as explicitly stated under ERISA, an April 28, 2008, letter from
the Congressional Budget Office to former congressman George Miller,
then chair of the Committee on Education and Labor, stated that "an
implicit expectation exists among many market participants and
policymakers that taxpayers will ultimately pay for benefits should PBGC
be unable to meet those obligations." [8]

To meet claims not covered by plan assets or obtained from terminated

plan sponsors, no funding can be obtained from the federal government.

This is because there are no appropriations from general revenues to cover

any claims. Instead, funding sources are limited to investment returns,

premiums received, and assets from terminated plans taken over by the

PBGC. Premiums are set by Congress. In 1974, when the PBGC was

established, the premium was set at \$1 per participant for single-employer

plans and \$0.50 per participant for multiemployer plans. The per-participant

rate has been raised over time, and it has also been adjusted for the financial

health of the plan as measured by the amount of underfunding of the vested

plan.

The PBGC can best be described as an insurer with little control over

key financial decisions that might permit it to increase the likelihood of

accomplishing its overarching mandate. Under ERISA, its mission is to

preserve the defined benefit plans it insures and to protect the beneficiaries

- f those plans. The agency's inability to employ strategies available to
private insurers and the influence of political issues associated with
decisions made by Congress make the management of the PBGC one of the
most challenging tasks faced by any financial institution.

The PBGC has acknowledged that, based on its current funded status

and investment policy, the probability is high that it will have insufficient

funds to pay all future benefits due current beneficiaries. For this reason, a

reasonable goal for the PBGC would be to maintain the program as long as

possible with the hope of eventually putting as small a deficit as possible on

the U.S. government should the government agree to bail it out.

Consequently, it is not a surprise that the GAO highlighted the PBGC as

a "high-risk" agency in its report to the U.S. Congress starting in 2003. In

its February 14, 2013, update, the GAO acknowledged the progress made

by the PBGC and actions by Congress to address the agency's weaknesses.

Nonetheless, the GAO concluded: "Because of long-term challenges related

to PBGC's governance and funding structure, PBGC's financial future is

uncertain." [9]

One obvious way to reduce the likelihood of receiving the assets of

terminated pension plans is for the PBGC to require one or more of the

following: larger contributions, higher premiums for underfunded plans, or

lower guaranteed payments. But such risk mitigation policies are currently

unavailable to the PGBC's management. Unlike for an insurer, the first two

requirements can have an adverse impact on the viability of current plans

covered by the PBGC, whereas the last is a politically sensitive issue.

Instead, it seems that the best that can be done is to prepare for the

terminated plans, working with the sponsors of troubled plans, and, in the

case of bankruptcy, litigating to obtain recovery of additional assets. These

practices are currently being pursued by the PBGC's management.

```
Problems with Private-Sector Defined Benefit Pension Plans

```

The value of the liabilities of a defined benefit plan can be measured in

terms of the present value of the projected payments to the plan's

beneficiaries. The value of the plan's assets is equal to the market value of

these assets. When the value of the assets exceeds the value of the

liabilities, the plan is said to have a surplus. In the opposite case, that is,

when the value of the liabilities exceeds the value of the assets, the plan is

said to have a deficit. Typically, as an indicator of the ability of a plan to

satisfy its liabilities, the funding ratio is calculated.

The funding ratio is the ratio of the plan's assets to its liabilities and is

the primary measure of the plan's financial health (i.e., ability to meet plan

- bligations). When there is a surplus, this means that the funding ratio
exceeds 100%, and the plan is said to be overfunded. The higher the
funding ratio, the healthier the plan is. Concern arises when there is a deficit
and the funding ratio falls below 100%. The plan in that case is
underfunded.

The management of a plan by a sponsor should focus on meeting the

liabilities. This means designing an investment policy and asset allocation

strategy to satisfy liabilities. As indicated earlier, one of the responsibilities

- f plan sponsor consultants is to work with the plan sponsor to develop an
investment policy and asset allocation strategy among the major asset
classes to satisfy those liabilities. Unfortunately, it was not until plans
realized substantial underfunding (i.e., funding ratios considerably below
100%) and huge deficits that there was acceptance of the major financial
crisis that corporate defined pension plans faced. This crisis led to the
passage on April 10, 2004, of the Pension Funding Equity Act, which gave
corporate sponsors of defined benefit plans some "relief" from burdensome
pension contributions and, as the 2004 act's summary stated, would "protect
the retirement benefits of millions of American workers and help ensure
that their pension benefits will be there when they retire." Unfortunately,
the bandage placed on this major hemorrhage was not adequate. As Richard
Ippolito, former chief economist of the PBGC, wrote after the passage of
the 2004 act:

Unfortunately, Congress has failed to adequately address the problems of the PBGC. In temporary

legislation passed in April 2004, Congress reduced the required contributions companies must make

to their defined-benefit pension plans by an estimated \$80 billion over two years by changing the

formula used to calculate pension liabilities. Congress also provided additional relief of

approximately \$1.6 billion to steel and airline companies with heavily underfunded pension plans. [10]

Congress subsequently modified and permanently extended the relief

granted in the 2004 act with the passage of the Pension Protection Act of

The primary beneficiaries of these laws were the beneficiaries of plans

sponsored by corporations in the steel and airlines industries. In fact, from

1975 to 2000, about 75% of the claims paid by the PBGC were made to

employees in those two industries: Bethlehem Steel (\$3.9 billion), LTV

Steel (\$1.9 billion), National Steel (\$1.1.3 billion), Pan American Airlines

(\$800 million), and Eastern Airlines (\$600 million). However, the pension

problem goes beyond the steel and airlines industries. Examples of

corporations with computed deficits based on December 31, 2003,

accounting statements were Ford Motor, Allegheny Technologies,

Goodyear, Navistar, Maytag, and Avon Products. [11] Moreover, the size of the

deficit can be so large that it exceeds the value of the corporate sponsor.

Bernard Condon, writing in _Forbes_ in August 2004, reported that

although in 1999 more than half the companies in the S&P 500 had

- verfunded plans, only 51 were overfunded in 2004. [12] Moreover, based on
pension fund accounting, which we describe later, strong arguments can be
made that the number of pension funds identified as overfunded in 1999
might be far lower than was reported. To show the severity of the problem,
Ippolito wrote in 2004:

Pension plan underfunding stands at more than \$350 billion, which increases the likelihood that more

pension plans will go under and taxpayers will eventually be called upon to provide a bailout. [13]

Some view this problem as the major financial crisis that the United

States will face in future years and that will more than likely cause the

phasing out of defined benefit plans in favor of defined contribution plans.

Moreover, the same is also true for public-sector defined benefit plans.

Although little had been mentioned in the press about the problems that

state and local governments face until recently, the concern is the same. The

question is: What caused this crisis?

Here we briefly present the reasons for the crisis. [14] However, the causes

are not different from what we described with regard to the U.S. S&L crisis:

poor regulatory supervision and poor asset/liability management. The

additional contributing factor here is the inadequate accounting and

actuarial treatment by the accounting and actuarial professions.

It is often denied by representatives of corporate plans and their

consultants, but historically, the investment policy of plans focused on the

growth of assets and not on the liability side. Plan sponsors made their asset

allocation decisions among the major asset classes—common stock, bonds,

real estate, and alternative assets—based on what was expected to be the

better-performing assets, without consideration of the liabilities. Hence,

during the period of rising equity prices in the 1990s, greater allocations

were made to that asset class. Stock market returns in 1997 and 1998, for

example, were 33% and 28%, respectively. Not only were plan sponsors not

watching liabilities when evaluating the performance of the plan, but some

accounting and actuarial rules allowed them to benefit from certain asset

allocations.

To understand the root of the crisis, let's look at the liability side, so that

we know how liabilities are valued. As just explained, the value of the

liabilities is determined by the present value of the future liabilities. Simple

enough, except when one asks what interest rate should be used to calculate

the present value of the liabilities. The interest rate used to calculate any

present value is called the **discount rate** . The basic property of the time

value of money is that the lower the discount rate is, the higher the present

value will be. When discussing the valuation of cash flows in later chapters,

we will see another important property about the relationship between

future cash flows and present value. Specifically, present value may be

highly sensitive to the discount rate used. This sensitivity of the present

value of cash flows is referred to as its **duration** . The duration measure

applies to both assets and liabilities. It is not our purpose here to describe

duration in any detail, but it is sufficient to understand its role in the

pension crisis story by noting that duration is the approximate percentage

change in the value of an asset or liability for a 100-basis-point change in

the discount rate or interest rate. Typically, duration for a defined benefit

plan is 15, so if pension liabilities are \$1 billion, as determined by using a

discount rate of, say, 10%, then if a discount rate of 9% is used instead, the

liabilities will increase by 15%, to \$150 million. Such a small change in the

discount rate leads to a significant change in the value of the liabilities!

Therefore, the question of who gets to establish the discount rate that is

used for computing the liabilities is important.

The answer to that question is that the rules for pension accounting for

financial reporting purposes allow the plan sponsor to determine it in

conjunction with actuaries. Basically, the sponsor should be using a

discount rate that reflects the rate of return on assets that it can reasonably

be expected to earn on the plan's assets in the future. This discount rate is

referred to accordingly as the **return on assets** . Determining the return on

assets is highly subjective in determining the economic well-being of the

plan, yet the choice (subject to some guidelines) is left with the plan

sponsor. In 2001, for example, the investor Warren Buffett had this to say

about this aspect of pension accounting:

Unfortunately, the subject of pension [return] assumptions, critically important though it is, almost

never comes up in corporate board meetings.… And now, of course, the need for discussion is

paramount because these assumptions that are being made, with all eyes looking backward at the

glories of the 1990s, are so extreme. I invite you to ask the CFO of a company having a large

defined-benefit pension fund what adjustment would need to be made to the company's earnings if its

pension assumption was lowered to 6.5 percent. And then, if you want to be mean, ask what the

company's assumptions were back in 1975 when both stocks and bonds had far higher prospective

returns than they do now. [15]

Buffett goes on to warn that too high a return on assets risks litigation

for a company's chief investment officer, its board, and its auditors. Yet

- verestimating return on assets is a hard-to-resist temptation, because it
produces a lower value for the liabilities and a higher funding ratio (i.e., a
seemingly healthier pension plan). [16]

We now have the background for understanding the pension crisis. In the

1990s, pension funds allocated more to common stock than to bonds, for

the reason described earlier. Starting in 2000, two conditions in the financial

markets moved against pension funds. First, the stock market declined,

which had a significant impact on the value of plan assets. Second, the

return on assets assumptions made by plan sponsors came under closer

scrutiny. Interest rates had declined, and with a dismal outlook for the stock

market, the return on assets assumption was lowered. The result was

deterioration in funding ratios. In fact, some still argue that the return on

assets assumptions that plan sponsors have adopted subsequently are still

too aggressive and that if the liabilities of pension plans were assessed

properly, funding ratios would be considerably lower.

To see how the selection of the return on assets trickles down to distort

the plan sponsor's corporate earnings, consider the evidence provided by

two Wall Street analysts, David Zion and Bill Carcache. [17] They estimated

that if the accounting treatment required by accounting rules were replaced

by what actually happened to the pension plans, the aggregate reported

earnings for companies in the S&P 500 would have been reduced by 69% in

2001 and by 10% in 2000. Thirty companies would have seen a decline in

earnings in excess of \$1 billion, with seven companies seeing a decline of

more than \$5 billion.

```
Problems with U.S. Public-Sector Defined Benefit Pension Plans

```

Our discussion of the problems faced in the private sector for defined

benefit plans also applies to the public sector. Defined benefit plans are far

more common than defined contribution plans in this sector for the reasons

noted in the chapter. As with private sector plans, these plans have been

characterized by poor asset management, a failure to understand how to

assess performance, and overly optimistic assumptions about asset returns.

These problems have resulted in considerable underfunding of public-sector

defined benefit plans. The "Milliman 2012 Public Pension Fund Study"

found that for the 100 largest public-sector defined benefit plans,

underfunding was \$895 billion, with a funding ratio of 75.1%. [18] The rate of

return on assets assumed in this calculation was 7.65%.

State and local governments have sought to deal with the underfunding

problems in several ways. [19] First, some sponsors have issued new bonds

with the sole purpose of refinancing current liabilities. This tactic has not

proved to be satisfactory in dealing with the long-term problem faced by

public-sector defined benefit plans. Second, the modification and the

adoption of new types of defined benefit plans by state and local

governments do nothing to reduce underfunding but instead add new risks

for taxpayers. Finally, encouraging employees' early retirement does not

deal adequately with the problem and is typically a costly solution.

In light of the failure of the so-called reforms that have been pursued by

state and local governments, a call has been made for public-sector pension

reform by freezing defined benefit plans and shifting to defined

contribution plans, as has been done in the private sector. However, it

should be remembered that despite the problems faced by the PBGC, there

is no equivalent insurer for public-sector defined benefit plans.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the importance of credit ratings in the financial market;
  - what a credit rating agency (CRA) is and what a nationally
recognized statistical rating organization is;

   - regulation of CRAs;
  - the different credit rating systems of the three major rating
companies;

   - the difference between investment-grade bonds and noninvestmentgrade (or high-yield) debt;
   - what a rating transition matrix is;
   - how regulators use credit ratings;
   - what the nonregulatory uses of credit ratings are;
  - the issuer-pay system for compensating CRAs and the potential
conflicts that can arise;

   - the concern about the overreliance of ratings by market participants;
and

   - factors considered in the rating of sovereign government debt,
corporate bonds, and U.S. municipal bonds.

A major risk in the financial system is default risk, which is one form of

credit risk. Default risk is the risk that the obligor will fail to satisfy the

terms of the lending agreement. This would involve failing to make the

contractual interest payments and the scheduled repayment of principal on a

timely basis. Investors who do not have access to their own credit analysis

staff use, to different degrees, opinions about default risk as provided by

companies that perform credit analysis and cast their opinion in the form of a

rating, referred to as a **credit rating** . These commercial rating companies are

referred to as **credit rating agencies** (CRAs). Although the term "agencies"

might suggest that they are somehow government-affiliated or governmentrelated entities, they are not.

In this chapter, we look CRAs, their role in financial markets, their credit

rating systems, the factors that they consider when assigning a credit rating,

and the controversies associated with CRAs in the performance of what is

expected of them.

```
The Role of CRAs in the Financial System

```

CRA ratings provide a critical function in the financial system by reducing

information asymmetry in the market for debt obligations and private

contracts. This role of CRAs has fostered the development of debt markets

throughout the world, improving market efficiency and allowing a reliable

interest rate structure [1] that can be used for determining compensation for

exposure to different degrees of default risk.

The notion of information asymmetry is important to understanding how

efficiently capital markets operate, so we'll start with a brief explanation. In

a two-party transaction, one party may have more information than the other

party. [2] For example, in the sale of a used car, the seller has more information

about the car's condition that affects its value than the potential buyer does.

In the case of a debt obligation, at the time of issuance, information

asymmetry exists because the issuer (i.e., the seller of the security) knows

more about the creditworthiness of the debt obligation than does the buyer

(i.e., the investor). Creditworthiness is not directly observable and therefore

requires that the buyer acquire information about this attribute of a debt

- bligation. Buyers can do this by (1) performing their own analysis of
creditworthiness based on information obtained from the issuer, (2) retaining
the services of a third party to provide an assessment of the creditworthiness

- f a debt obligation, or (3) using ratings that a CRA provides to the public.
The difference between the second and third alternatives is that the third

party provides a private evaluation, whereas a CRA evaluation is available to

the public and does not require that a fee be paid by the buyer. Instead, the

issuer pays a fee, a practice that has raised the problem of a potential conflict

- f interest, as discussed later in this chapter. [3]

```
CRAs and Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations

in the United States

```

Because CRAs play a critical role in credit markets by performing credit

analysis on entities issuing securities or private contracts, in the United

States, entities that have been recognized by the Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) to assign ratings are referred to as **nationally**

**recognized statistical rating organizations** (NRSROs). For an entity

seeking to be classified as an NRSRO, the SEC's Office of Credit Ratings

(created in 2006 by the Credit Rating Reform Act) reviews the entity's

position in the market and operational capability. With respect to position in

the market, the focus is on whether the entity is nationally recognized. For

- perational capability, the SEC looks at organizational structure, rating
procedure and methodology, financial resources sufficient to maintain
independence of the entities it rates, the size and quality of the staff, and
independence from the companies that it rates. In addition to its role in the
registration of NRSROs, the Office of Credit Ratings monitors the activities
and performs periodic examinations of registered NRSROs.

When a CRA applies to the SEC for NRSRO status, it becomes registered

with respect to one or more of the following five categories of ratings: (1)

financial institutions, brokers, or dealers; (2) insurance companies; (3)

corporate issuers; (4) issuers of asset-backed securities; and (5) issuers of

government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign

government. [4] The 10 CRAs registered as NRSROs as of December 2015 and

the date of their initial registration are [5]

```
European Regulation of CRAs

```

CRAs did not perform well in assigning ratings to structured finance

products such as subprime mortgage-backed securities. More specifically,

these products, which had been awarded the highest credit rating, exhibited

poor credit performance. In 2007 and 2008, this systematic overrating led to

the collapse of the subprime mortgage-backed securities market and had a

ripple effect on global credit markets and the global economy. Another

concern was the downgrading of sovereign government debt of certain

countries in the eurozone, which some market observers viewed as

unjustified. As a result of the global credit crisis and the downgrading of

certain sovereign debt, European regulators sought measures to strengthen

the regulatory and supervisory framework for CRAs when operating in the

European Union.

To so do, the following rules were established by the European Union.

First, a regulatory framework and oversight structure was introduced in

2009. More specifically, registration of CRAs was required, they had to

provide a sound methodological basis for deriving ratings that had to be

transparent to market participants, and they were required to avoid conflicts

- f interest. When the European Securities and Market Authority was created
in 2011, CRAs had to register with this entity, which then regulated the
registered CRAs. To deal with regulator concerns about sovereign ratings, in
2013, the rules were amended to address what were perceived to be
weaknesses with the CRA rating methodology.

Later in this chapter, we will discuss a major concern with credit ratings:

the overreliance of investors on ratings. We will also discuss a major

problem with CRAs: conflicts of interest in assigning ratings. The

regulations of the European Securities and Market Authority seek to reduce

- verreliance on credit ratings and potential conflicts of interests of CRAs. In
addition, the regulations seek to make the credit rating process more
transparent, improve the reliability of ratings, and encourage more entities to
participate in the credit rating business.

```
Credit Rating Systems

```

Each CRA assigns a rating to the entity or financial instrument being rated.

The three major CRAs are Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. The rating systems

used by these three rating companies are shown in table 5.1, along with a

brief description of each rating.

```
Table 5.1
```

Summary of corporate bond ratings systems investment grade: high creditworthiness.

Moody's S&P Fitch Brief Definition

Aaa AAA AAA Gilt edge, prime, maximum safety

Aa1 AA+ AA+

Aa2 AA AA Very high grade, high quality

Aa3 AA– AA–

A1 A+ A+

A2 A A Upper medium grade

A3 A– A–

Baa1 BBB+ BBB+

Baa2 BBB BBB Lower medium grade

Baa3 BBB– BBB–

Ba1 BB+ BB+

Ba2 BB BB Low grade, speculative

Ba3 BB– BB–

B1 B+ B+

Caa CCC CCC Substantial risk, in poor standing

CCC–

Ca CC CC May be in default, extremely speculative

C C C Even more speculative than those above

CI CI = Income bonds; no interest is being paid

DDD Default

DD

D D

In all three systems, the term **high grade** means low default risk; that is,

there is a high probability of future payments. Moody's uses the symbol Aaa

to designate the highest-grade debt obligations, but the other two major

CRAs use AAA. The next highest grade is Aa (Moody's) or AA (S&P and

Fitch). All CRAs use the symbol A to denote the third grade. The next three

grades are Baa or BBB, Ba or BB, and B, respectively. There are also C

grades. S&P and Fitch use plus or minus signs to provide a narrower credit

quality breakdown within each class, and Moody's uses 1, 2, or 3 for the

same purpose. These refinements in the ratings are referred to as rating

"notches."

Debt obligations rated triple A (AAA or Aaa) are said to be **prime** ;

double A (AA or Aa) are of **high quality** ; single A issues are referred to as

**upper medium grade**, and triple B are **medium grade** . Lower-rated debt
issues are said to have speculative elements or to be **distinctly speculative** .

If a debt obligation has a rating in the top four categories, it is said to be

**investment grade** . When a debt obligation is assigned a rating below the top

four categories, it is said to be **noninvestment grade** - r more popularly

referred to as **high-yield debt** - r, unfortunately, misnamed a **junk debt** .

Thus, the debt market can be divided into two sectors based on credit

ratings: the **investment-grade market** and the **noninvestment-grade**

**market** . This distinction is important, because investment guidelines of

institutional investors may prohibit the purchase of noninvestment-grade

debt obligations.

If a rated entity receives a different rating from two or more CRAs, the

rating is said to be a **split rating** . For example, Moody's might assign a

particular bond issue a AA rating, whereas S&P might assign the same issue

an A rating.

After the initial rating is assigned, a CRA monitors the debt obligation or

issuer. A CRA may announce that it is reviewing a particular credit rating,

and it may go further and state that the outcome of the review may result in a

**downgrade** (i.e., a lower credit rating being assigned) or an **upgrade** (i.e., a

higher credit rating being assigned). The risk that there will be a change in a

credit rating that results in a lower rating is referred to as **downgrade risk** .

When this announcement is made by a rating agency, the issue or issuer is

said to be under **credit watch** .

In addition, to help market participants make credit decisions, for certain

types of debt instruments, the CRAs provide information for assessing

potential rating downgrades and upgrades. They do so by periodically

publishing a **rating transition matrix** - r **rating migration matrix** . These

tables are available for different transition periods (e.g., one year or five

years).

Table 5.2 shows a portion of a hypothetical average one-year transition

matrix for corporate bonds. In the table, the first row shows the start-of-theyear rating, and the first column shows the end-of-year rating. Look at the

cell where the rating at the beginning of the year is A1 and the rating at the

end of the year is A1. This cell represents the percentage of issues rated A1

at the beginning of the year that did not change their rating over the year,

that is, experienced no downgrades or upgrades. As can be seen, 75.80% of

the issues rated A1 at the start of the year were rated A1 at the end of the

year.

```
Table 5.2

```

A hypothetical average one-year rating migration table.

Now look at the cell where the rating at the beginning of the year is A1

and at the end of the year is A3. This shows the percentage of issues rated

A1 at the beginning of the year that were downgraded to A3 by the end of

the year, 2.91%. One can interpret this figure as a probability. In our

example, it is the probability that an issue rated A1 will be downgraded to

A3 by the end of the year. A rating transition matrix also shows the potential

for upgrades. Again, in table 5.3, issues rated A2 at the beginning of the year

have a 5.24% chance of being upgraded to A1 at the end of the year.

```
Use of Ratings by Regulators

```

Because of the perceived importance of the need for third-party credit

analysis, U.S. regulators began to incorporate rating requirements for

financial regulatory purposes in 1931. In that year, the Fed and another

banking regulator, the Comptroller of the Currency, required that banks use

ratings for distinguishing between investment-grade and noninvestmentgrade bonds. For all bonds rated noninvestment grade, banks had to report

their holdings in terms of market value, which was not the case for

investment-grade bonds, where the holdings were reported in terms of the

purchase price. The Fed and the Comptroller of the Currency, along with yet

another banking regulator, the FDIC, banned the purchase of noninvestmentgrade bonds by banks in 1936. The National Association of Insurance

Commissioners used ratings for determining capital reserve requirements.

Specifically, in 1951, insurers who invested in lower-rated bonds had higher

capital reserve requirements imposed.

The term "NRSRO" was adopted in 1975 so that the SEC could

determine how much capital brokerage firms and dealer firms must hold for

different grades of debt instruments on their balance sheets. This

requirement led to greater reliance on NRSROs to define creditworthiness in

federal and state regulations. For example, when establishing the appropriate

investments in which insurance companies may invest, several state

insurance codes rely to different degrees on the ratings of NRSROs. [6]

The U.S. Congress relied on credit ratings when defining such terms as a

"mortgage-related security." The Secondary Market Enhancement Act of

1984 stipulated that mortgage-related securities be rated in one of the two

highest rating categories by at least one of the CRAs. Credit ratings were

employed by the U.S. Department of Education for setting financial

responsibility standards for entities that wished to participate in student

financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of

1965. With greater use of credit ratings by the U.S. Congress in lawmaking

and by regulators in monitoring financial institutions, institutional investors

adopted ratings in their investment guidelines and mandates for both internal

and external managers. Registered investment companies incorporated them

into their prospectuses. For example, the SEC's Rule 2a-7 for money market

funds, which we discuss in chapter 32, prohibits investment in certain types

- f securities if they do not have a credit rating.

```
Nonregulatory Use of Ratings

```

In addition to regulators' use of credit ratings, four other market participants

benefit from the existence of ratings: issuers, asset management firms,

brokerage firms and dealers, and transactors in private contracts.

Issuers of debt obligations typically must have at least one rating to

market their securities. This is because investors, by investment guidelines

- r regulation, set forth permissible investments in terms of NRSRO ratings.

When an entity issues a security, the yield at which it has to offer the

security to the public is the cost of its funds. As explained in chapter 23, the

higher the rating is, the lower the funding cost will be.

In chapter 3, we discussed asset management firms. These firms receive

mandates from clients. For example (and what is relevant here), some firms

have accounts in which they can invest only in debt obligations that receive

a certain rating. For example, there are client funds that can be invested only

in investment-grade bonds, whereas others can invest primarily in

noninvestment-grade bonds. The investment guidelines that an asset

management firm must comply with in managing client funds dictate the

permissible credit-rated debt obligations. Asset management firms typically

have a credit analysis group that performs independent research to analyze

the issuer's creditworthiness. Typically the credit analysis group will use

ratings as a screen to determine eligible debt obligations in which the firm

can invest. As discussed later in this chapter, a major concern for regulators

is that investors might rely too much on these ratings.

Brokerage firms and dealers utilize ratings in several ways. First, when

- ffering debt instruments to clients (asset management firms and retail
investors), they make sure that the securities offered are consistent with a
buyer's investment guidelines. Second, when acting in their capacity as
investment advisers for issuers of debt obligations, they discuss with their
clients which CRAs to obtain a rating from. Third, as explained earlier,
securities firms are required to use ratings for determining net capital
requirements, which is the reason the SEC created the NRSRO designation
for qualified CRAs.

Finally, private contracts can arise in the financial market between two

parties. The most common example is the over-the-counter derivative

contract. Ratings are used to determine acceptable counterparties. Brokerage

firms and dealers determine the minimum rating for a counterparty using

investment guidelines and, where applicable, regulatory requirements.

```
Concerns Regarding CRAs

```

Ratings are opinions and not guarantees. So it is not surprising that defaults

have occurred despite a debt issue initially receiving a high investment-grade

rating. However, some of the miscues by CRAs in the past suggested to

regulators that greater oversight of CRAs was in order. In the 1980s, for

example, new, legally untested bond structures were introduced into the U.S.

municipal bond market. The best-known example is the Washington Public

Supply System's revenue bonds (nicknamed "Whoops" bonds), issued for

five nuclear power plants (Projects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) in 1980. S&P and

Moody's rated the bonds for Projects 1, 2, and 3 triple A and the bonds for

Projects 4 and 5 A− (by Moody's) and A+ (by S&P). Only one of the

nuclear power plants was completed, the issuer defaulting on \$2.5 billion,

the largest municipal bond default at the time. In 1994, Orange County,

California, defaulted on bonds it had issued that had been rated AA/Aa by

both Moody's and S&P, leading to the bankruptcy filing of that county. At

the time, it was the largest bankruptcy of a municipality in U.S. history.

In the 1990s, alternatives were considered by the SEC with respect to

how to deal with the use of NRSRO ratings when implementing rules set

forth by the SEC and the designation of entities as NRSROs. Basically, the

SEC decided to continue the use of NRSRO ratings and the designation of

NRSROs. The alternatives that the SEC considered were (1) eliminating

reliance on NRSRO ratings and not designating an NRSRO and (2) putting

into place more direct and expanded oversight of CRAs. In 1997, the SEC

sought comments from market participants for the attributes of a rating

- rganization to qualify as an NRSRO and also set forth a formal application
process for a rating organization seeking NRSRO status. Three other issues
for which comments were solicited by the SEC were whether to (1) prohibit
an NRSRO from charging issuers a fee based on the issuance size of a
transaction (because of concern that a size-based fee would compromise an
NRSRO's objectivity); (2) mandate that an NRSRO make its ratings
generally available to the public, not just to its subscribers; and (3) substitute
under certain circumstances statistical models of default risk for ratings. The
SEC did not act on these issues at that time.

The major concerns and increased awareness of the ratings assigned by

CRAs began in the early 2000s as a result of the well-publicized

bankruptcies of major corporations that were initially highly rated. The first

was Enron Corporation, whose bonds carried an investment-grade rating just

days before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001—the biggest corporate

bankruptcy in U.S. history. In 2002, there was the bankruptcy of WorldCom.

Its bonds were rated investment grade three months prior to its bankruptcy

filing. In March 2002, the bonds of Global Crossing were rated investment

grade; in July 2002, it defaulted on its loans. There were California utilities

that were rated A—two weeks prior to defaulting. The bonds of AT&T

Canada carried an investment-grade rating in February 2002; the company

defaulted in September 2002.

As a result of the Enron bankruptcy in 2001, Congress reviewed the

issues relating to CRAs. Two hearings were held in 2002 (January and

March) by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. The March 20

hearing, titled "Rating the Raters: Enron and the Credit Rating Agencies," [7]

focused specifically on the role of CRAs in the Enron bankruptcy. Testimony

by one prominent legal expert argued that Congress should instruct

regulatory authorities to discard the use of ratings, because ratings failed to

provide useful or timely information about an issuer's creditworthiness. The

conclusion of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs' staff report,

titled _Financial Oversight of Enron: The SEC and Private-Sector_

_Watchdogs_, [8] concluded that the CRAs exhibited a disappointing lack of

diligence in their credit analysis of Enron.

More recently, attacks on the performance of ratings assigned by CRAs

to structured products leading up to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis have

raised further concerns in the United States and other major countries. The

focus of the investigations both in the United States and in Europe has been

- n two issues. The first is the influence of the issuer on the ratings assigned
to securities that it issues. The second is investors' overreliance or exclusive

reliance on ratings.

```
Influence of the Issuer on Ratings

```

When the credit rating business started, users/investors of ratings would pay

the CRA. That is, the compensation was a **user-pay model** . The ratings were

published monthly, and subscribers paid for the books. Enter that great

innovation in the 1970s: the photocopier. Because all or portions of the

ratings book could be copied and distributed, the user-pay model was no

longer feasible for CRAs as a business model. To survive, the CRAs shifted

from a user-pay model to **issuer-pay model**, wherein the payment for the

assignment of a rating became the responsibility of the issuer. Although an

issuer could refuse to obtain any rating, typically, they would obtain at least

- ne rating from one of the CRAs, because it would be difficult to issue a
debt obligation without a rating. But the issuer-pay model can result in a
potential for conflicts of interest, which calls into question the objectivity of
ratings. More specifically, it has been argued that issuers will select a CRA
from which it can obtain the highest possible rating, and that, in an attempt
to attract issuers, a CRA will compromise its rating criteria to the benefit of
the issuer.

This potential conflict of interest has given rise to the **rating shopping**

**hypothesis** about the behavior of issuers in their dealings with CRA. This

hypothesis asserts that an issuer will search (i.e., shop) among the CRAs for

the one that provides the best credit rating. [9] Another form of the rating

shopping hypothesis relates to shopping for as many ratings as possible,

even if it is at the same rating level. Moreover, there is a concern that when

monitoring issuers that it has rated, a CRA may be hesitant to downgrade the

debt of those issuers because in the future, downgraded issuers may be

reluctant to have new debt rated by that CRA.

The counterargument is that CRAs have a strong "incentive to build and

protect their reputations for being independent and objective." [10] A CRA's

success in the marketplace depends in large part on the reputational capital

that it builds, because the issuers will not continue to pay for ratings from a

CRA that investors believe may have been biased in the past. Thus, a CRA's

reputation for issuing honest and objective ratings is perhaps its greatest

marketable asset, and reputational incentives to issue objective ratings are a

strong countervailing force acting against any potential conflict of interest

engendered by the issuer-pay model. In fact, an empirical study conducted

by two members of the Federal Reserve Board found "no evidence

consistent with rating agencies acting in the interests of issuers due to a

conflict of interest" and that "instead, rating agencies appear to be relatively

responsive to reputation concerns and so protect the interests of investors." [11]

```
Investors’ Overreliance on Ratings

```

The increased adoption by regulators and market participants elevated the

role of ratings. It has been argued that the unintended consequence is the

- verreliance on ratings by investors, asset managers, and regulators. There is
growing concern that investors, particularly institutional investors, rely on
ratings without performing their own credit analysis and that herd behavior
results from relying solely on ratings. A report by the SEC acknowledged
the growing dependence on ratings by investors and regulators not only for
public debt offerings but also for private debt arrangements. For example,
ratings are used in determining collateral requirements by counterparties for
non-exchange traded derivatives and by dealers in lending transactions. Two
studies suggest that overreliance on the ratings of emerging market
sovereign bonds was a destabilizing factor in the 1997–1998 Asian financial
crisis. [12]

In April 2008, a report by the Financial Stability Forum states: "Investors

should address their over-reliance on ratings. Investor associations should

consider developing standards of due diligence and credit analysis for

investing in structured products." [13] In response, in late 2008, such industry

associations as the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the

European Securitization Forum, and the Investment Management

Association prepared industry guidelines to address the issue of overreliance

- n ratings for securitized products.

Proposals both in the United States and in Europe have sought to reverse

the alleged overreliance or sole reliance on ratings. Section 939A of the

Dodd-Frank Act resulted in the SEC "adopting amendments today to remove

references to credit ratings in rules and forms promulgated under the

Securities Act and the Exchange Act." [14] The SEC stated:

While we recognize that credit ratings play a significant role in the investment decisions of many

investors, we want to avoid using credit ratings in a manner that suggests in any way a "seal of

approval" on the quality of any particular credit rating or rating agency, including any nationally

recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO"). Similarly, the legislative history indicates that

Congress, in adopting Section 939A, intended to "reduce reliance on credit ratings."

A similar tack has been taken for banks in the eurozone. In July 2011, the

European Commission's internal markets commissioner, Michel Barnier,

stated in a speech to the European Securities and Markets Authority, "To

limit overreliance, we will be strengthening the requirement for banks to

carry out their own analysis of risk and not rely on external ratings in an

automatic and mechanical way." [15]

```
Factors Considered When Assigning Ratings

```

As discussed earlier in the chapter, CRAs rate a wide range of debt

- bligations by different issuers. Here we briefly describe the factors that they
consider when rating the debt of sovereign governments, corporations, and
U.S. state and local governments. All CRAs consider the same factors. They
differ as to what weight they assign to each factor when determining their
final rating.

```
Sovereign Government Debt

```

Sovereign debt is the obligation of a country's central government. For the

reasons discussed subsequently, two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by

credit rating agencies, a **local currency debt rating** and a **foreign currency**

**debt rating** .

The three major CRAs all assign ratings to sovereign bonds. The two

general categories of risk analyzed when assigning ratings are economic risk

and political risk. The former category is an assessment of the ability of a

government to satisfy its obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative

analyses are used to assess economic risk.

**Political risk** is an assessment of the willingness of a government to
satisfy its obligations. A government might be able to pay but unwilling to
do so. Political risk is assessed based on qualitative analysis of the economic
and political factors that influence a government's economic policies.

The reason for distinguishing between local debt ratings and foreign

currency debt ratings is that historically, the default frequency differs by the

currency denomination of the debt. Specifically, defaults have been greater

- n foreign currency–denominated debt. The reason for the difference in
default rates for local currency debt and foreign currency debt is that if a
government is willing to raise taxes and control its domestic financial
system, it can generate sufficient local currency to meet its local currency
debt obligation. This is not the case with foreign currency–denominated
debt. A national government must purchase foreign currency to meet a debt

- bligation in that foreign currency and therefore has less control with respect
to its exchange rate. Thus, a significant depreciation of the local currency
relative to a foreign currency in which a debt obligation is denominated will
impair a national government's ability to satisfy such obligations.

The implication is that the factors analyzed to assess the creditworthiness

- f a national government's local currency debt and foreign currency debt
will differ to some extent. When assessing the credit quality of local
currency debt, for example, S&P emphasizes domestic government policies
that foster or impede timely debt service. For foreign currency debt, credit
analysis by S&P focuses on the interaction of domestic and foreign
government policies. S&P analyzes a country's balance of payments and the
structure of its external balance sheet. The areas of analysis with respect to
its external balance sheet are the net public debt, total net external debt, and
net external liabilities.

```
Corporate Debt

```

To assess the default risk of a corporate issuer or a corporate debt obligation,

CRAs generally look at three areas: (1) the protections afforded to

debtholders that are provided by covenants limiting management's

discretion, (2) the collateral available to the debtholder should the issuer fail

to make the required payments, and (3) the ability of an issuer to make the

contractual payments to debtholders.

There are covenants imposed on management. Covenants establish rules

for several important areas of operation for corporate management. These

provisions are safeguards for the debtholder. Indenture provisions are

analyzed carefully when assigning a rating to a bond or loan. When

assessing the ability of an issuer to service its debt (i.e., make timely

payments of interest and principal), the ability of an issuer to generate cash

flow goes considerably beyond the analysis of the myriad financial ratios

and cash flow measures that can be used as a basic assessment of a

company's financial risk. CRAs also look at qualitative factors, such as the

issuer's business risk and corporate governance risk, to assess the issuer's

ability to pay.

**Business risk** is the risk associated with generating operating cash flows.
Operating cash flows are uncertain, because the revenues and the
expenditures composing the cash flows are uncertain. Revenues depend on
conditions in the economy as a whole and in the industry in which the
company operates, as well as on the actions of management and its
competitors. To assess business risk, the three major CRAs look at the same
general areas. S&P states that when analyzing business risk, it considers
country risk, industry characteristics, company position, product
portfolio/marketing, technology, cost efficiency, strategic and operational
management competence, and profitability/peer group comparisons. [16]
Moody's investigates industry trends, national political and regulatory
environment, management quality and attitude toward risk taking, and basic

- perating and competitive position. [17] Fitch reviews industry trends,
- perating environment, market position, and management. [18]

Corporate governance issues have to do with (1) the ownership structure

- f the corporation, (2) the practices followed by management, and (3)
policies for financial disclosure. The eagerness of corporate management to
present favorable results to shareholders and the market has been a major
factor in several of the corporate scandals in recent years and is what is
referred to as **corporate governance risk** . Chief executive officers, chief
financial officers, and the board of directors are being held directly
accountable for disclosures in financial statements and other corporate
decisions. Certain mechanisms can mitigate the likelihood that management
will act in its own self-interest. These mechanisms fall into two general
categories. In the first category are mechanisms that more strongly align the
interests of management with those of shareholders. Such an alignment can
be accomplished by granting management an economically meaningful
equity interest in the company. Also, manager compensation can be linked to
the performance of the company's common stock.

In the second category are the company's internal corporate control

systems, which can provide a way to effectively monitor the performance

and decision-making behavior of management.

In addition to corporate governance, CRAs look at the quality of

management when assessing a corporation's ability to pay. To assess

management quality, Moody's examines the business strategies and policies

formulated by management. The factors Moody's considers are strategic

direction, financial philosophy, conservatism, track record, succession

planning, and control systems.

Having achieved an understanding of a corporation's business risk and

corporate governance risk, the CRAs move on to assessing financial risk.

The analysis involves traditional ratio analysis and other factors affecting the

firm's financing. These measures, which are described in most books on

investment management, address interest coverage, leverage, cash flow, net

assets, and working capital. Once these measures are calculated for the firm

being analyzed, CRAs compare them with similar measures for other firms

in the same industry.

```
U.S. Municipal Debt

```

The market for subgovernment debt is the subject of chapter 21. We'll

describe here the factors that CRAs consider when assigning ratings to

subnational entities in the United States, more specifically, the debt of state

and local governments. As explained in chapter 21, there are two basic types

- f municipal security structures: tax-backed debt and revenue bonds. Taxbacked debt obligations are some form of tax revenue. The common type of
tax-backed debt is a general obligation debt. The second basic type of
security structure is found in a revenue bond. Such bonds are issued for
either project or enterprise financings where the bond issuers pledge to the
bondholders the revenues generated by the operating projects being
financed. Examples include airport revenue bonds, college and university
revenue bonds, hospital revenue bonds, single-family mortgage revenue
bonds, multifamily revenue bonds, public power revenue bonds, resource
recovery revenue bonds, toll road and gas tax revenue bonds, and water
revenue bonds.

To evaluate tax-backed debt, the CRAs assess information in four basic

categories. The first category includes information on the issuer's debt

structure and overall debt burden. The second category relates to the issuer's

ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy. The focus

- f attention here is usually on the issuer's general operating funds and

whether the issuer has maintained balanced budgets over three to five years.

The third category involves the specific local taxes and intergovernmental

revenues available to the issuer, as well as historical information on both tax

collection rates (which are important when looking at property tax levies)

and the dependence of local budgets on specific revenue sources. The last

category of information necessary for the credit analysis is an assessment of

the issuer's overall socioeconomic environment. The determinations to be

made for this category include trends of local employment distribution and

composition, population growth, real estate property valuation, and personal

income, among other economic factors.

Although numerous security structures can be used for revenue bonds,

the key factor in rating such debt is whether the project being financed will

generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the obligation to bondholders. The

analysis is comparable to the factors considered when rating corporate debt.

```
Key Points

```

- Credit rating agencies (CRAs) play a critical role in credit markets by
performing credit analysis on entities issuing securities or private contracts
and casting their opinions in the form of a credit rating.

- CRAs reduce information asymmetry in the market for debt obligations
and private contracts.

- CRAs recognized by the SEC are classified as nationally recognized
statistical rating organization (NRSROs).

- The three major CRAs are Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's
Rating Services, and Fitch Ratings.

- In terms of credit rating, the debt market is divided into two sectors: the
investment-grade market and the noninvestment-grade market.

- A debt obligation is investment grade if its ratings are in the top four
rating categories.

- A debt obligation assigned a rating below the top four categories is said to
be noninvestment grade, or more popularly referred to as high-yield debt.

- The compensation system for assigning ratings has shifted from a user-pay
system to an issuer-pay system.

- A major concern with the issuer-pay system is that it may result in
conflicts of interest, because it can result in rating shopping and the
reluctance of a CRA to downgrade an issuer.

- Because of the importance placed on credit ratings by regulators, a major
concern is that investors overrely or exclusively rely on ratings rather than
performing their own credit analysis.

- Sovereign debt, the obligation of a country's central government, is
assigned two credit ratings, a local currency debt rating and a foreign
currency debt rating, because historically, the default frequency differs
according to the currency denomination of the debt.

- The CRAs analyze both quantitative and qualitative factors when
assessing the economic risk and political risk of sovereign debt issues.

- When assigning a credit rating to corporate debt, the CRAs assess the
protections set forth in the loan agreement, the collateral available for the
debtholders should the issuer fail to make the required payments, and the
capacity of the issuer to fulfill its payment obligations.

- When assessing the ability of a corporate issuer to service its debt, CRAs
assess the issuer's business risk, corporate governance risk, and financial
risk.

- When assessing business risk (the risk associated with operating cash
flows), some of the main factors considered are industry characteristics and
trends, the company's market and competitive positions, management
characteristics, and the national political and regulatory environment.

- Assessing corporate governance risk involves assessing (1) the ownership
structure of the corporation, (2) the practices followed by management, and
(3) policies for financial disclosure.

- Assessing corporate financial risk involves traditional ratio analysis and
valuation of other factors affecting the firm's financing.

- To assess the debt of municipal issuers in the United States, a different
type of credit evaluation is used for tax-backed debt and revenue-backed
debt.

- Four basic categories are analyzed when assigning a credit rating to taxbacked debt: (1) the issuer's debt structure and overall debt burden, (2) the
issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy,

(3) the specific local taxes and intergovernmental revenues available to the

issuer, and (4) the issuer's overall socioeconomic environment.

- For revenue bonds, the key factor in rating such debt is whether the project
being financed will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the obligation due
bondholders.

incorporated into the U.S. regulatory framework. The report states:

During the past 30 years, regulators, including the Commission, have increasingly used credit ratings

to help monitor the risk of investments held by regulated entities, and to provide an appropriate

disclosure framework for securities of differing risks. [19]

Give at least two examples of how regulators have used credit ratings to do

the stipulated activities.

3. At one time, buyers paid for the service of having a bond rated. However, with the invention of the
photocopier and therefore the ability to easily distribute an opinion to those who did not pay for
having the rating, the CRAs shifted to an issuer-pay system.

Learning Objectives

```

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - what a depository institution is;
   - how a depository institution generates income;
   - who the U.S. federal regulators of depository institutions are;
   - the basic principles of the regulation of depository institutions;
  - what the soundness and safety principle is for depository
institutions;

   - the rating of banks using the CAMELS system;
   - the public backstops available to depository institutions;
   - what the Basel Accords are, and the pillars on which they are based;
   - what risk-based capital requirements are for depository institutions
and how they are calculated;

   - the regulation of systemic risk by federal banking agencies;
   - the types of income-generating activities of depository institutions;
   - how depository institutions obtain funds;
   - the method for determining reserve requirements;
   - the rationale for depository insurance, and how the insurance is
priced;

   - what thrifts are, and the differences between thrifts and banks; and
   - what the shadow banking system is, and the concerns with this form
   - f credit intermediation.

Depository institutions include commercial banks (or simply, "banks") and

thrifts (savings associations and credit unions). These financial

intermediaries accept deposits. Deposits represent the liabilities (debt) of

the deposit-accepting institution. With the funds raised through deposits and

- ther funding sources, depository institutions make direct loans to various
entities and also invest in securities. Their income is derived from two

sources: the income generated from the loans they make and the securities

they purchase, and fee income.

Depository institutions are highly regulated because of the important

role they play in the financial system. Deposit accounts at banks are the

principal means by which individuals and business entities make payments.

In all countries, banks are subject to government regulation that imposes

specific requirements, restrictions, and guidelines. The basis for bank

regulations are (1) licensing and supervision (the need to have a license to

engage in the banking business), (2) minimum requirements (the most

important of which is bank minimum capital requirements), and (3) market

discipline (banks must disclose financial and other information to

depositors and other creditors).

Governments implement monetary policy through their banking system.

Because of their important role, depository institutions are afforded special

privileges, such as access to some form of deposit insurance and access to a

government entity that provides funds for liquidity for emergency needs.

An important global banking practice is deposit insurance, which is

practiced in many countries to protect bank depositors from losses resulting

from a bank's inability to honor withdrawals. The International Association

- f Deposit Insurers, formed to enhance deposit insurance effectiveness, has
83 members globally. Special privileges, such as deposit insurance, are
referred to as "public backstops."

As of year-end 2017, the 10 largest banks in the world as measured by

the market value of their common stock in order of size were JPMorgan

Chase & Co. (\$376 billion), Bank of America Corp. (\$313 billion),

Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (\$312 billion), Wells Fargo (\$306

billion), China Construction Bank (\$228 billion), HSBC Holdings (\$205

billion), Citigroup (\$200 billion), Bank of China (\$166 billion), Royal Bank

- f Canada (\$117 billion), and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (\$108
billion).

In this chapter, we look at depository institutions, with a primary focus

- n banks. We focus on the U.S. banking system, because it reflects the
banking systems in other advanced economies. At the end of the chapter,
we discuss a sector of the financial system referred to as the "shadow
banking system" and the concerns associated with the activities of that
nontraditional banking system.

```
Regulators of U.S. Banks

```

Today we are aware of the role of the federal government in the regulation

- f commercial banks, but prior to 1863, the federal government played
almost no role in their regulation. Instead, banks were regulated only at the
state level. Realizing the need for a stronger banking system, the U.S.
Congress passed the National Bank Act in 1863 authorizing the federal
chartering of national banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) was created and empowered with providing national bank charters
and regulation of national banks. As a result, there existed state and national
banks, a structure popularly referred to as "dual banking." The dual banking
structure still exists today, with every state having its own state banking
department responsible for regulating banks chartered by the state.

Realizing the need for banks to obtain liquidity during periods of

economic stress, the federal government wanted to establish a banking

system that would have an entity that banks could borrow from, a sort of

"lender of last resort." The U.S. Congress accomplished this with the

passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.This legislation established the

Federal Reserve System (FRS) as the central banking system. Banks that

were members of the FRS were entitled to all the services that the FRS was

empowered to provide by the legislation. We discuss these services later in

this section. The legislation required that all nationally chartered banks

become members of the FRS. State-chartered banks had the option to

become members. Most state-chartered banks elected not to become

members.

Today, state-chartered banks can be classified as state banks that are

members of the FRS and nonmember state banks. With the passage of the

Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980,

the capital requirements that we shall discuss for member banks were also

applied to state-chartered nonmember banks.

Today, banks are regulated and supervised by several federal and state

government entities. "Bank regulation" refers to a federal agency's

authority to issue specific regulations and guidelines that govern the

- perations, activities, and acquisitions of banking organizations.

Once those regulations and guidelines are in place, bank supervision

involves monitoring and examining the condition of individual banks and

determining whether they are compliant with the regulations. Enforcement

powers are granted to federal agencies if a bank fails to comply with

regulations or is found to have financial difficulties. Below we discuss the

three federal agencies that regulate banks: the Federal Reserve, the OCC,

and the FDIC. [1] Before doing so, we discuss briefly the various types of

bank structure.

The simplest form of bank structure is a national bank that has no

subsidiaries. A more complex form is a national bank that has two

subsidiaries, an operating subsidiary that performs typical bank activities

(discussed later) and a financial subsidiary that undertakes activities that are

financial in nature. There are two types of holding company structures. (A

holding company is one that owns other companies.) In a bank holding

company, the parent holding company has as part of its holdings a national

bank and a state bank. In a financial holding company, the parent holding

company has as its holdings a national bank and a securities company.

Basically, financial holding companies are conglomerates that are allowed

to engage in a wide range of financially related activities. Large banks are

typically financial holding companies, and the activities performed by the

securities company are the investment banking activities that we describe in

chapter 9.

```
The Federal Reserve

```

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or simply, the Fed)

was established in 1913. Its objective is to regulate banks and certain other

types of depository institutions through bank reserves so as to provide

stability to the banking sector through its authority to conduct national

monetary policy. In addition, the Fed has the authority to conduct safety and

soundness examinations of bank holding companies, the U.S. branches of

foreign banks, and state-chartered banks that are members of the FRS.

The responsibilities of the Fed were significantly expanded by the

Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also called the GrammLeach-Bliley Act) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

Protection Act of 2010 (hereafter the Dodd-Frank Act). The former made

the Fed the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies. The DoddFrank Act made the Fed the primary regulator of all financial firms (bank

and nonbanks) that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)

designates as systemically significant, [2] as well as the safety and soundness

authority over the payment, clearing, and settlement systems that the FSOC

identifies as systemically important and that are not regulated by the

Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the SEC.

Consequently, not only does the Fed have the power of examining banks, it

now also oversees the country's systemic risk.

```
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

```

The OCC is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. [3]

The head of the OCC is the comptroller of the currency and is appointed by

the president of the United States, with the advice and consent of the U.S.

Senate. It is the responsibility of the OCC to charter, regulate, and supervise

both national banks and federal savings associations. The Dodd-Frank Act

made the OCC the primary regulator of federal savings associations. The

OCC also supervises federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The

OCC's goal in supervising banks and federal savings associations is to

"ensure that they operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance

with laws requiring fair treatment of their customers and fair access to

credit and financial products." [4] To fulfill its responsibility, the OCC has

examiners who are responsible for analyzing loan and investment

portfolios, analyzing funds management, rating banks (using the system

described later in this chapter), and determining compliance with consumer

banking laws for national banks and federal savings associations with less

than \$10 billion in assets. Furthermore, the National Risk Committee of the

OCC monitors the federal banking system to identify any potential or actual

threats to the system's safety and soundness.

As with the Fed, the OCC's responsibilities include overseeing systemic

risk. One way in which it does so is by surveying the underwriting practices

- f those it regulates—through the Survey of Credit Underwriting Practices
- which identifies trends in lending standards and credit risk for the most

common types of commercial and retail credit offered by national banks

and federal savings associations.

```
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

```

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that (1) insures deposits, (2)

examines individual banks, (3) supervises banks, and (4) resolves both

troubled or failed banks and any financial institution (bank or nonbank) that

is designated a SIFI. Funding for the FDIC comes from the insurance

premiums paid by banks and thrift institutions for deposit coverage and

from interest the FDIC earns on investing in U.S. Treasury securities.

The FDIC is given broad authority to utilize deposit insurance funds to

assist depository institutions if a determination is made that there is

systemic threat to the financial system. This authority was granted to the

FDIC by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of

1991. The involvement of the FDIC as the 2008 financial crisis worsened

serves as an example of its functions. In October 2008, the FDIC made a

determination of an increase in systemic risk to the system. First, with the

approval of Congress as provided for in the Emergency Economic

Stabilization Act of 2008, the maximum amount of any deposit insured by

the FDIC was temporarily increased to \$250,000 from its previous level of

\$100,000. (Subsequently the Dodd-Frank Act made the \$250,000 ceiling

permanent.) Second, the FDIC agreed to temporarily guarantee both all

noninterest-bearing accounts without consideration for the \$250,000

insurance ceiling and certain newly issued debt by banks, thrifts, and certain

holding companies. (Subsequently the Dodd-Frank Act explicitly

authorized the FDIC to guarantee bank debt.)

**`FDIC resolution role for troubled banks`** One of the most critical

roles of the FDIC is to provide a resolution when an FDIC-insured bank is

about to fail. The resolution process followed by the FDIC is supposed to

be executed in a manner that minimizes disruption to the banking system

and maximizes value.

The FDIC assumes two roles in the resolution process. First, because it

is an insurer, the FDIC protects all of the failing bank's depositors for the

amount of their insured deposits by using one of the three resolution

methods discussed later in this chapter. Second, the FDIC serves as the

bank's receiver and administers the receivership estate for all creditors.

These two roles played by the FDIC—protecting depositors in its insurer

role and acting as receiver for all creditors—are functionally different.

The FDIC can employ three basic resolution mechanisms for failing

insured banks: (1) purchase and assumption transactions, (2) deposit

payoffs, and (3) open bank assistance transactions.

In a **purchase and assumption transaction**, a bank purchases some or

all of the assets of a failed bank and assumes some or all of the liabilities,

including all insured deposits. To complete the transaction, the acquiring

(assuming) bank occasionally may receive some form of assistance from

the FDIC.

In a **deposit payoff transaction**, the failing bank is closed, and the

FDIC is appointed receiver. In its role as insurer, the FDIC immediately

pays all depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured

deposits. Depositors whose deposits are uninsured and other general

creditors of the bank do not receive any payment but instead receive from

the FDIC in its role as receiver a certificate entitling the holder to a portion

- f the proceeds received by the FDIC when the failed bank's assets are
liquidated. The certificate is called a receivership certificate.

In the third resolution method, an **open bank assistance transaction**,

the FDIC in its role of insurer provides financial assistance to a bank that is

in danger of failing. The FDIC does so by making loans to the bank,

purchasing the assets of the bank, or placing additional deposits in the bank.

This resolution method is no longer commonly used because of restrictions

imposed by legislation in the early 1990s on what the FDIC can do.

```
FDIC resolution role for systemically important financial
```

**`institutions`** Prior to 2008, the FDIC had the authority to resolve
troubled insured banks and thrifts. However, it did not have the right to take
any action against other financial institutions that were not insured banks or
thrifts. So, for example, the FDIC did not have the authority to place into an
FDIC receivership a holding company or an affiliate of an insured bank or
any other nonbank financial company that might pose a systemic threat to
the financial system.

The best-known example of these financial entities excluded from FDIC

receivership is Lehman Brothers, whose failure caused major disruption to

global financial markets. The resolution could potentially have been

realized through the U.S. bankruptcy courts. However, the bankruptcy of

Lehman Brothers in October 2008 clearly demonstrated that the bankruptcy

system was not equipped to deal with the swift resolution of a financial

institution whose failure posed a major threat to the financial system.

Because of this regulatory gap in the government's resolution authority,

the Dodd-Frank Act extended the FDIC's receivership power and authority

to allow it to effect an orderly liquidation of troubled financial institutions

(banks and nonbanks) designated as **global systemically important banks**

(G-SIBs) by the FSOC. The act requires that all bank holding companies

with assets of more than \$50 billion designated as G-SIBs prepare a

resolution plan that could be achieved through the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The plan—commonly referred to as a "living will"—must describe how, in

the event of material financial distress or failure, the G-SIB would be

resolved in a rapid and orderly manner under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The U.S. Congress felt that bankruptcy would be the preferred procedure

for resolving the failure of a G-SIB. However, it realized that it might be

unrealistic to expect U.S. bankruptcy courts to do so in a manner that would

reduce the risk of a systemic threat to the financial system. For this reason,

it included in the Dodd-Frank Act a provision that grants the FDIC broad

backup authority to place any G-SIB into an FDIC receivership process.

The FDIC can use this authority if (1) no reasonable private sector

solution is available to avert the default of the G-SIB and (2) a resolution

that could potentially be obtained through the bankruptcy process would

have serious adverse effects on the financial system. This is not a blanket

authority granted to the FDIC. Instead, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a twothirds vote of the Federal Reserve Board and the board of the FDIC and a

determination by the secretary of the Treasury to carry out this authority.

```
Bank Regulation

```

Bank regulation has three components: (1) safety and soundness, (2) deposit

insurance, and (3) systemic risk. We described the role of bank regulators

with respect to systemic risk earlier in the chapter. Our focus here is on the

first two components.

```
Safety and Soundness Regulation

```

In broad terms, safety and soundness regulation and supervision involve

assessing a bank's likelihood of defaulting and, if a default does occur,

assessing the magnitude of the losses that will be realized by the bank's

creditors and stockholders.

**`Bank ratings`** To measure the safety and soundness of a bank, an
examiner conducts on-site examinations with a focus on reviewing and
rating a bank's performance, financial condition, and regulatory compliance
with regulations. The result of the on-site examination is a bank rating. The
use of a bank rating system increases the likelihood that bank examiners
will be consistent in their examinations of banks while allowing for
differences that exist among banks owing to bank size and the complexity
and riskiness of a bank's revenue-generating activities. The system used to
rate banks that has been adopted by federal bank regulators is the CAMELS

_c_ _a_

rating system, which stands for apital adequacy, sset quality,

_m_ anagement, _e_ arnings, _l_ iquidity, and _s_ ensitivity to market risk. It has the

elements shown in table 6.1.

Elements of CAMELS bank ratings.

Element Description

Capital

adequacy

Capital A capital adequacy assessment entails assessing a bank relative to its risks, such as credit

adequacy risk, market risk, and other risks associated with the bank's financial position on both

balance sheet and off-balance-sheet items.

Asset quality An asset quality assessment entails assessing existing and potential credit risk associated

with a bank's portfolio, as well as risks associated with the bank's off-balance-sheet

items. Included in this analysis are recent changes in a bank's default rate on loans,

exposure to counterparty risk, the performance of the portfolio, and changes in the

marketability of assets.

Management A management assessment involves assessing the corporate governance of a bank by its

senior management team and board of directors. Management oversight and systems in

place to deal with compliance and interaction with external auditors, for example, are

examined.

Earnings Current earnings and their sustainability are examined to rate a bank's earnings quantity

and quality.

Liquidity A bank's liquidity is assessed by looking at the bank's ability to fulfill its expected

funding needs in a timely manner without incurring excessive losses that could result if

the bank were forced to sell assets at a significant discount from market prices. Other

liquidity factors that examiners assess are economic factors, such as the trend of deposits

and the stability of deposits.

Sensitivity Because a bank's assets and off-balance-sheet items are affected by changes in the factors

to market that drive their values, bank examiners assess the market risk exposure to these factors.

risk

Because a bank's assets and off-balance-sheet items are affected by changes in the factors

that drive their values, bank examiners assess the market risk exposure to these factors.

Also considered in assigning a rating is the ability of the bank's management to manage

the portfolio's risk exposure to control a mismatch in the duration of assets and liabilities,

as well as management's ability to monitor and control permitted trading activities.

**`Capital adequacy and capital requirements`** Later in this chapter we
discuss the various activities undertaken by banks. Of course, these
activities can result in the realization of losses. To protect depositors, a bank
must have adequate capital to absorb such losses, as well as to mitigate the
potential risk that widespread banking losses may occur that would
adversely affect the credit market and the real economy. As part of its safety
and soundness regulation, the amount of capital that a bank needs to have

- n hand to absorb losses must be determined. That amount, referred to as a
bank's capital requirement, is determined by regulators relative to the
bank's total assets and the risk attributes associated with the assets in which

the bank has invested.

Minimum capital requirements are established by regulators and then

applied by them in their supervisory role. However, there is not just one

minimum capital requirement, because regulators have established several

categories of capital. To establish a bank's minimum capital requirement,

regulators must evaluate the trade-off between imposing a level that is

reasonable to reduce the risk of default and maintain a bank's ability to

remain solvent but at the same time is not so high that it would severely

restrict the amount of capital available for credit to the different sectors of

the economy.

For a business, the term "capital" refers to the amount of equity supplied

by the stockholders of a firm, or in this case, a depository institution's

stockholders. It is measured by the difference between the value of the

assets and the value of the liabilities. When determining a bank's capital,

the regulations mandate that total assets and liabilities be measured in

different ways. This results in different definitions of capital.

Because the amount of capital required cannot be invested in higherearning assets, capital requirements for a bank represent a cost of doing

business. Capital requirements are constantly being revised. At one time,

the rules were based solely on the view of U.S. regulators regarding capital

adequacy. Since 1988, capital requirements have been established based on

an international framework developed by the Bank for International

Settlements (BIS) and referred to as the **Basel Accords** . Unlike the pre1988 capital requirements, which in the United States were based on a

bank's total assets, the various standards established by the Basel Accords

(described later in this chapter) link capital requirements to the risks

associated with a bank's assets, and hence the standards are referred to as

**risk-based capital requirements** . The principle is simple: the riskier an

asset is, the greater the capital required to protect against the risk of loss

will be. Initially, the sole risk that was considered in the Basel Accords was

credit risk. In later Basel Accords, capital requirements were based on

market risk and operational risk in addition to credit risk.

The Basel Accords—referred to as Basel I (the first accord, published in

1988), Basel II, and Basel III—which establish a bank's capital

requirements are constantly undergoing changes and modifications. It is

impractical to delve into their nuances and calculations here. Instead, we

will review some of the broader principles involved.

Under the Basel Accords, the calculation of risk-based capital

requirements can be done in one of two ways. The first is based on an

external assessment of the credit riskiness of a bank and is referred to as the

**standardized approach** . In this approach, the assets held by a bank are
grouped by type of financial instrument and are further grouped by the
credit rating associated with the obligor. Examples of an external
assessment would be the ratings assigned by the CRAs.

The second approach is based on a bank's internal credit risk models and

internal rating system and accordingly is referred to as the **internal rating–**

**based approach** . Banks that adopt this approach are permitted to apply

their own internal measures for determining the key drivers of credit risk as

primary inputs to the calculation of their capital requirement, with the

stipulations that certain conditions must be satisfied and explicit

supervisory approval is required. The credit risk models allow the bank to

determine the probability of default of the borrowers in its portfolio and to

construct an estimate of loss should a default occur. Once these risk

measures are obtained from internal models, they are converted into risk

weights, which are used to determine capital requirements using a formula

set by the BIS.

The Basel Accords are built on what the BIS refers to as three "pillars":

(1) minimum capital requirements, (2) supervisory review process, and (3)

market discipline. Our focus here is on the first pillar, which deals with the

calculation of the minimum capital requirement based on credit, market,

and operational risk. The starting point is defining what is meant by

"capital." At this stage of our understanding of capital markets, explaining

the components is difficult. Suffice it to say that the BIS defines Tier 1 and

Tier 2 capital, the difference lying in what components make up each. [5]

**Tier 1 capital**, also referred to as **core capital**  - r **basic equity**, includes
two components. The first is permanent shareholders' equity. This is stock
issued by the bank that is fully paid common stock and perpetual preferred
stock. Perpetual preferred stock is preferred stock that does not mature and
for that reason is considered permanent equity. The second component of
Tier 1 capital is "disclosed reserves." This component is a little more
difficult to grasp, but it is basically the amount of profits retained and any
reserves that the bank has set aside for general or legal contingencies.

**Tier 2 capital**, also called **supplementary capital**, comprises several
components; we mention only two here. The first is hybrid (debt/equity)
capital instruments, a category that includes financial instruments that
combine the characteristics of equity capital and debt. The second is
subordinated debt, which includes conventional unsecured subordinated
debt capital instruments with a minimum original fixed term to maturity
exceeding five years and preferred stock that has a limited life (as opposed
to perpetual preferred stock).

Regulatory capital is based on the liability/stockholders' equity side of

the balance sheet. What must be determined next is how much weight to

give to the different financial instruments in the bank's portfolio. This is

needed because it is not the total assets of the bank but the risk-weighted

assets that are considered in assessing regulatory capital. Thus, weights

must be assigned to each financial instrument. The BIS determines what

those weights should be for each asset. There are weights based on credit

risk, market risk, and operational risk, and the weights also depend on the

method the bank chooses for calculating its capital requirement, the

standardized approach or the internal rating–based approach, which we

discuss later in this chapter.

Based on the definition of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets, a

capital ratio is calculated. A bank's total capital ratio may not be less than

8% of Tier 1 capital.

```
Deposit Insurance

```

Because of the important economic role played by banks, the U.S.

government sought a way to protect banks against depositors who, because

- f what they thought were real or perceived problems with a bank, sought
to withdraw funds in a disruptive manner. Bank panics occurred frequently
in the early 1930s, resulting in the failure of banks that might have survived
economic difficulties except for the massive withdrawals they experienced.

The federal government created a backstop, devised in 1933, to prevent

a run on the bank: federal deposit insurance. This insurance was provided

through a new agency, the FDIC. A year later, federal deposit insurance was

extended to S&Ls with the creation of the Federal Savings and Loan

Insurance Corporation. In 1933, federal deposit insurance covered accounts

up to \$2,500. Today the standard maximum deposit insurance amount is

\$250,000. The maximum coverage applies per depositor, per insured

depository institution, for each account ownership category. Since federal

deposit insurance was established in 1933, no depositor has lost any money

- n an FDIC-insured deposit.

Even though federal deposit insurance achieved its objective of

preventing runs on banks, it unfortunately created incentives that

encouraged managers of depository institutions to take on excessive risks. If

highly risky investments work out, the benefits accrue to the stockholders

and management; however, if they do not, it is the depositors who are

supposed to absorb the losses. Yet depositors feel little concern about the

risk that a depository institution is assuming, because their funds are

insured by the federal government. From a depositor's perspective, as long

as the amount deposited does not exceed the insurance coverage, one

depository institution is as good as another.

The pricing of premiums imposed by the FDIC for its first 50 years in

- peration differed significantly from the current system. Basically, during
this 50-year period, all insured depository institutions paid a premium for
insurance coverage based on the institution's size. More specifically, an
annual premium rate of 3.3 to 8.3 cents was paid for every \$100 of insured
deposits. Legislation in the 1980s and 1990s altered this system, effectively
turning such premiums into penalties for violating risk-based capital
requirements or acts violating the supervisory process rather than for
insurance coverage per se. In the absence of any violations, the FDIC
charged no premiums for deposit insurance coverage, regardless of the risk
profile of an institution.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991

mandated that the FDIC establish a risk-based deposit insurance assessment

system. The FDIC complied with the mandate by adopting a regulatory

system that classified insured depository institutions into nine risk

categories. The classifications were based on a combination of two factors.

The first was a capital evaluation, and the second was a supervisory rating.

The capital evaluation was based on data contained in an insured depository

institution's _Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income_, more

commonly referred to as the **Call Report** . Based on these data, an insured

depository institution was assigned a capital evaluation of either well

capitalized (Group 1), adequately capitalized (Group 2), or undercapitalized

(Group 3). A consolidation of the nine risk categories into just four risk

categories was made by the FDIC in 2007, once again basing the

categorization of an insured depository institution on capital evaluations

and supervisory ratings.

In 2010, the FDIC was ordered by the Dodd-Frank Act to amend its

methodology for assessing pricing for insured depository institutions. The

final rules eliminated risk categories for large institutions; they also

combined the CAMELS ratings described earlier in the chapter and

forward-looking financial measures to obtain one of two scores. The first

score was for what was classified as **highly complex institutions** . The

second score was for all others classified as **large institutions** . For large

and highly complex institutions, the two scores are (1) a performance-based

score and (2) a loss severity score. These scores are then combined to

- btain a total score.

The total assessment rate that determines the price of deposit insurance

for an insured depository institution is obtained (after some adjustments)

through calculations that convert the total score into the amount of the

assessment obligation. However, these final amendments for assessing risk

for the purpose of pricing deposit insurance are likely to be modified further

to be more consistent with the standardized approach under the Basel III

risk-based capital rules described earlier.

```
Bank Activities

```

Commercial banks are involved in numerous income-generating activities,

which can be broadly classified as follows: (1) individual banking, (2)

institutional banking, and (3) global banking. Of course, different banks

generate more activity in some areas than in others. For example, money

center banks (defined later) are more active in global banking.

**Individual banking** encompasses consumer lending, residential
mortgage lending, consumer installment loans, credit card financing,

automobile and boat financing, brokerage services, student loans, and

individual-oriented financial investment services (such as personal trust and

investment services). Mortgage lending and credit card financing generate

interest and fee income. Mortgage lending is often referred to as "mortgage

banking." Brokerage services and financial investment services also

generate fee income.

Loans to nonfinancial corporations, financial corporations (such as life

insurance companies), and government entities (state and local governments

in the United States and foreign governments) fall into the category of

**institutional banking** . Also included in this category are commercial real

estate financing, leasing activities, and factoring (i.e., purchasing of

accounts receivable of a business). In the case of leasing, a bank may be

involved in leasing equipment as a lessor, [6] as a lender to lessors, or as a

purchaser of leases. Loans and leasing generate interest income, and other

services that banks offer institutional customers generate fee income. These

services include management of the assets of private and public pension

funds, fiduciary and custodial services, and cash management services

(such as account maintenance, check clearing, and electronic transfers).

In the area of **global banking**, banks now compete head-to-head with

another type of financial institution—investment banking firms. Global

banking covers a broad range of activities involving corporate financing

and capital market and foreign exchange products and services. Most global

banking activities generate fee income rather than interest income. At one

time, some of these activities were restricted by federal legislation. More

specifically, the Banking Act of 1933 contained four sections barring

commercial banks from certain investment banking activities. These four

sections are popularly referred to as the **Glass-Steagall Act** . After decades

- f debate regarding the need for such restrictions, the Glass-Steagall Act
was repealed with the enactment of the **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act** in
November 1999, which expanded the permissible activities for banks and
bank holding companies.

**Corporate financing** involves two components. The first is the
procuring of funds for a bank's customers, which can go beyond traditional
bank loans to involve the underwriting of securities. When assisting their

customers to obtain funds, banks also provide bankers' acceptances, letters

- f credit, and other types of guarantees for their customers. That is, if a
customer borrows funds backed by a letter of credit or other guarantee, its
lenders can look to the customer's bank to fulfill the obligation. The second
area of corporate financing involves providing advice on such matters as
strategies for obtaining funds, corporate restructuring, divestitures, and
acquisitions.

Capital market and foreign exchange products and services involve

transactions in which the bank may act as a dealer or broker in a service.

For example, some banks are dealers in U.S. government or other securities.

Customers who wish to transact in these securities can do so through the

government desk of the bank. Similarly, some banks maintain a foreign

exchange operation, buying and selling foreign currency. Bank customers in

need of foreign exchange can use the services of the bank. In their role as

dealers, banks generate income in three ways: (1) through the bid-ask

spread; (2) from capital gains on the securities or foreign currency used in

transactions; and (3) in the case of securities, through the spread between

interest income earned by holding the security and the cost of funding the

purchase of that security.

The financial products developed by banks to manage risk also yield

income. These products include interest rate swaps, interest rate

agreements, currency swaps, forward contracts, and interest rate options.

We discuss each of these products in later chapters. Banks generate either

commission income (i.e., brokerage fees) or spread income from selling

such products.

```
Bank Funding

```

When describing the nature of the banking business, we focused on how a

bank can generate income. We now look at how a bank can raise funds. The

three sources of funds for banks are (1) deposits, (2) nondeposit borrowing,

and (3) common stock and retained earnings. Banks are highly leveraged

financial institutions, which means that most of their funds come from

borrowing—the first two sources. Included in nondeposit borrowing are

borrowing from the Federal Reserve through the discount window facility,

borrowing reserves in the federal funds market, and borrowing through the

issuance of instruments in the money and bond markets.

```
Deposits

```

Several types of deposit accounts are available. **Demand deposits**

(checking accounts) not paying any interest or minimal interest can be

withdrawn on demand. Savings deposits pay interest (typically below

market interest rates), do not have a specific maturity, and usually can be

withdrawn on demand.

**Time deposits**, also called **certificates of deposit**, have a fixed maturity
date and pay either a fixed or a floating interest rate. Some certificates of
deposit can be sold in the open market prior to their maturity if the
depositor needs funds. Other certificates of deposit cannot be sold. If a
depositor elects to withdraw the funds from the bank prior to the maturity
date, the bank imposes an early withdrawal penalty. A **money market**
**demand account** is one that pays interest based on short-term interest rates.
The market for short-term debt obligations is called the **money market**,
which is how these deposits get their name. They are designed to compete
with money market mutual funds.

```
Reserve Requirements and Borrowing in the Federal Funds Market

```

A bank cannot invest \$1 for every \$1 it obtains in deposit. All banks must

maintain a specified percentage of their deposits in a noninterest-bearing

account at one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. These specified

percentages are called **reserve ratios**, and the dollar amounts based on them

that are required to be kept on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank are called

**required reserves** . The reserve ratios are established by the Federal

Reserve Board (the Fed). The reserve ratio differs by type of deposit. The

Fed defines two types of deposits: transactions and nontransactions

deposits. Demand deposits and what the Fed calls "other checkable

deposits" are classified as transactions deposits. Savings and time deposits

are nontransactions deposits. Reserve ratios are higher for transactions

deposits relative to nontransactions deposits.

To arrive at its required reserves, a bank does not simply determine its

transactions and nontransactions deposits at the close of each business day

and then multiply each by the applicable reserve ratio. The determination of

a bank's required reserves is more complex. Here we give a rough idea of

how it is done. First, to compute required reserves, the Federal Reserve uses

.

an established two-week period called the **deposit computation period**

Required reserves are the average amount of each type of deposit held at the

close of each business day in the computation period, multiplied by the

reserve requirement for each type.

Reserve requirements in each period are to be satisfied by **actual**

**reserves**
, which are defined as the average amount of reserves held at the
close of business at the Federal Reserve Bank during each day of a twoweek reserve maintenance period, beginning on Thursday and ending on
Wednesday two weeks later. For transactions deposits, the deposit
computation period leads the reserve period by two days. For
nontransactions deposits, the deposit computation period is the two-week
period four weeks prior to the reserve maintenance period.

If actual reserves exceed required reserves, the difference is referred to

as **excess reserves**

. Because reserves are placed in noninterest-bearing

accounts, an opportunity cost is associated with excess reserves. At the

same time, the Fed imposes penalties on banks that do not satisfy the

reserve requirements, giving banks an incentive to manage their reserves so

as to satisfy reserve requirements as precisely as possible.

Banks temporarily short of their required reserves can borrow reserves

from banks with excess reserves. The market where banks borrow or lend

reserves is called the **federal funds market** . The interest rate charged to

borrow funds in this market is called the **federal funds rate** . Because of the

importance of this market, which is part of the interbank lending market, we

discuss it further in chapter 25, where we cover the money market.

```
Borrowing at the Fed Discount Window

```

The Federal Reserve Bank is the banker's bank—or, to put it another way,

the bank of last resort. Banks temporarily short of funds can borrow from

the Fed at its discount window.

Collateral is necessary to borrow, but not just any collateral will do. The

Fed establishes (and periodically changes) the types of eligible collateral.

Currently it includes (1) Treasury securities, federal agency securities, and

municipal securities, all with a maturity of less than six months, and (2)

commercial and industrial loans with 90 days or less to maturity.

The interest rate that the Fed charges to borrow funds at the discount

window is called the **discount rate** . The Fed changes this rate periodically

to implement monetary policy. Bank borrowing at the Fed to meet required

reserves is quite limited in amount, even though the discount rate generally

is set below the cost of other sources of short-term funding available to a

bank. The Fed views borrowing at the discount window as a privilege to be

used to meet short-term liquidity needs and not as a device to increase

earnings.

Continual borrowing for long periods and in large amounts is thereby

viewed as a sign of a bank's financial weakness or as exploitation of the

interest differential for profit. If a bank appears to be going to the Fed

frequently to borrow relative to its previous borrowing pattern, the Fed will

make an "informational" call to ask for an explanation for the borrowing. If

no subsequent improvement in the bank's borrowing pattern occurs, the Fed

then makes an "administrative counseling" call, in which it tells the bank

that it must stop its borrowing practice.

```
Other Nondeposit Borrowing

```

Most deposits have short maturities. Bank borrowing in the federal funds

market and at the discount window of the Fed is short term. Other

nondeposit borrowing can be short term (in the form of issuing obligations

in the money market) or intermediate to long term (in the form of issuing

securities in the bond market). An example of the former is the repurchase

agreement (or "repo") market, which we discuss in chapter 26. Examples of

intermediate or long-term borrowing are floating-rate notes and bonds.

Banks that raise most of their funds from the domestic and international

money markets, relying less on depositors for funds, are called **money**

**center banks** . In contrast, a **regional bank** is one that relies primarily on

deposits for funding and makes less use of the money markets to obtain

funds. In recent years, the mergers of larger regional banks with other

regional banks have formed so-called "superregional banks." With their

greater size, these superregional banks can compete in certain domestic and

international financial activities that were once the domain of money center

banks.

```
Nonbank Depository Institutions: Thrifts

```

Thrifts are nonbank depository institutions; they include savings institutions

and credit unions. As with banks, thrifts can operate under a federal or state

charter and have their deposits insured by a federal agency. The federal

insurer can be the FDIC for savings associations and the National Credit

Union Administration (NCUA) for credit unions. All depository institutions

are subject to periodic regulatory and federal insurance examination.

Although there are differences between banks and thrifts in terms of the

activities in which they specialize and certain regulatory oversights, all

depository institutions have become more like each other in the past two

decades and their differences have become less distinct. The new regulatory

structure as set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act and the slight expansion in the

range of activities permitted for thrifts, as well as the adoption of the

international capital standards required by the Basel Accords, have been the

latest and most dramatic step toward blurring the distinction between thrifts

and banks.

```
Savings Institutions

```

**Savings institutions** include S&Ls and savings banks. These thrifts are
either mutually owned or operate under corporate stock ownership.
"Mutually owned" means no stock is outstanding, so technically the
depositors are the owners. The provision of funds for financing the
purchase of a home motivated the creation of savings institutions, and
accordingly, residential mortgages typically compose the principal assets of
savings institutions.

The Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 mandates that a federal savings

association is required to be a **qualified thrift lender** . There is a test to

qualify, the qualified thrift lender test, which requires that the thrift hold

qualified thrift investments equal to at least 65% of its asset portfolio. The

list of QTLs includes many home-related lending and other forms of retail

lending (e.g., student loans, automobile loans). Examples of home-related

lending are (1) loans to purchase, refinance, construct, improve, or repair

domestic residential or manufactured housing; (2) home equity loans; and

(3) securities backed by or representing an interest in mortgages on

domestic residential or manufactured housing.

For funding, savings institutions offer accounts that look similar to

demand deposits and that pay interest, called **negotiable order of**

**withdrawal** accounts. They also offer money market deposit accounts, can

borrow in the federal funds market, have access to the Fed's discount

window, and can borrow from the Federal Home Loan Banks (which are

called _advances_ ).

Larger S&Ls operate as holdings companies (SLHCs). According to the

Home Owners' Loan Act, an SLHC includes any company that directly or

indirectly controls either a savings association or any other company. As

institutions, **savings banks** are similar to, although much older than, S&Ls..

With respect to regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred regulatory

responsibility for thrifts from the Office of Thrift Supervision to two federal

banking agencies. More specifically, the OCC has enforcement authority

- ver federal savings associations, but the FDIC has the same authority over
state savings associations. The OCC and the FDIC have different
enforcement policies from those that the Office of Thrift Supervision had.
In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, SLHCs are regulated in almost the
same manner as bank holding companies. The OCC and FDIC have the
supervisory authority to limit activities that are legally permissible for
savings associations.

Although major legislation dealing with depository institutions came

about as a result of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, prior substantial

legislation followed the financial problems faced by S&Ls in the 1980s,

referred to as the **S&L crisis** . The appendix to this chapter describes this

crisis. It is worthwhile reading about the S&L crisis, because it provides an

excellent example of a poorly designed financial institution that was from

the outset likely to fail and impose substantial costs on U.S. taxpayers.

```
Credit Unions

```

Credit unions are the smallest of the depository institutions. Credit unions

can obtain either a state or a federal charter. The Federal Credit Union Act

- f 1934 authorized the formation of federally chartered credit unions in all
states. Their unique aspect is the "common bond" requirement for credit
union membership. According to the statutes that regulate federal credit
unions, membership in a federal credit union "shall be limited to groups
having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a
well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district."

Credit unions are either cooperatives or mutually owned. No corporate

stock ownership is permitted. The dual purpose of credit unions is therefore

to serve their members' saving and borrowing needs. Technically, because

credit unions are owned by their members, member deposits are called

_shares_ . The distribution paid to members is therefore in the form of

dividends, not interest.

The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund insures the shares of

all federally chartered credit unions. State-chartered credit unions may elect

to have National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund coverage; for those

that do not, insurance coverage is provided by a state agency.

Federal regulations apply to federally chartered credit unions and statechartered credit unions that elect to become members of National Credit

Union Share Insurance Fund. Most states, however, specify that statechartered institutions must be subject to the same requirements as federally

chartered ones. Effectively, therefore, most credit unions are regulated at

the federal level. The principal federal regulatory agency is the NCUA.

Credit unions obtain their funds primarily from deposits of their

members. With deregulation, they can offer a variety of accounts, including

share drafts, which are similar to checking accounts but pay interest. The

Central Liquidity Facility, which is administered by the NCUA, plays a role

similar to the Fed's as the lender of last resort. The Central Liquidity

Facility provides short-term loans to member credit unions with liquidity

needs.

Credit union assets consist of small consumer loans, residential

mortgage loans, and securities. Regulations 703 and 704 of the NCUA set

forth the types of investments in which a credit union can invest. They can

make investments in **corporate credit unions** . What is a corporate credit

union? One might think that a corporate credit union is a credit union set up

by employees of a corporation. It is not. Federal and state-chartered credit

unions are referred to as "natural person" credit unions, because they

provide financial services to qualifying members of the general public. In

contrast, corporate credit unions provide a variety of investment services, as

well as payment systems, only to natural person credit unions.

```
Shadow Banking

```

What we have described above concerning depository institutions is

referred to as the "traditional banking system" for providing credit. As

explained, there is considerable regulation of the depository institutions

because of the important role that credit plays in financial markets and the

real economy. Moreover, public backstops are available to depository

institutions to minimize risk to depositors and to the financial system in

general.

An important contributor to the 2008–2009 financial crisis was a system

.

that few market participants were aware of—the **shadow banking system**

We conclude this chapter with a discussion of shadow banks.

To put the shadow banking system into perspective, we can place it in

the context of two common forms of credit intermediation: [7] (1)

_nonintermediated, direct lending_, whereby borrower and lender interact

directly, and (2) _intermediated lending through traditional banking_,

whereby banks take in deposits and lend them to customers (consumers,

businesses, and governments). **Shadow banking** is a form of credit

intermediation, a market-based form of lending, that involves entities and

activities that are outside the traditional banking system. It therefore lacks

the regulation of and backstops available to banks.

As mentioned in chapter 3, financial intermediaries perform such

functions as maturity intermediation and diversification. Traditional banks

perform these functions and have been the primary form of credit

intermediation. As explained in this chapter, this is done through a

regulatory structure that examines banks for safety and soundness, allows

for the control of credit, and provides a backstop for depositors when

financial problems arise (through deposit insurance) and by providing a

lender of last resort.

In the mid-1970s, new approaches to obtaining credit appeared that

differed from both traditional banking and nonintermediated, direct lending.

These new approaches, the result of the financial innovations occurring at

that time, resulted in what has been referred to as shadow banking. The

adjective "shadow" indicates that this form of credit intermediation was far

less transparent to the public and to regulators than was traditional

banking. [8] The legal entities created for the purpose of shadow banking

transactions were called **special-purpose vehicles** (SPVs). As with

traditional banking, shadow banking involved substantial leverage. In fact,

because of the lack of regulation, the leverage available in shadow banking

was much greater than that available in traditional banking. Despite the

greater risks of liquidity and leverage associated with shadow banking

compared to traditional banking, this form of credit intermediation took

place in a system that lacked the public backstops that exist in traditional

banking.

SPVs created for the purpose of shadow banking obtain their funding

not through deposits, as is done by traditional banks, but through a chain of

market-based transactions. [9] It is difficult to explain these transactions for

funding for shadow banks at this stage of our study of financial markets,

because they make use of some of the financial innovations and

participation by parties described in later chapters of this book. The chain of

transactions typically involves an SPV issuing commonly used debt

- bligations, such as commercial paper and repurchase agreements (see
chapter 26). However, funding is not limited to those two common forms of
borrowing. There are also relatively new forms of debt obligations, referred
to as structured credit instruments, that use the securitization technology
described in chapter 27. The debt obligations issued by SPVs are acquired
by such market participants as collective investment vehicles (e.g., mutual
funds), insurance companies, and pension funds. Effectively, these
participants are the equivalent of depositors, but they are not protected by
depository insurance.

Although our description makes it seem as though shadow banking and

traditional banking are independent (i.e., the parties involved in shadow

banking are separate from traditional banks), that is not the case. The SPVs

created for shadow banking transactions are linked not only to major banks

but also to major investment banking firms and insurance companies. The

major risk with shadow banks is that because of the absence of public

backstops available to banks (such as deposit insurance and a lender of last

resort), the SPVs involved in this form of credit intermediation are

susceptible to greater funding risk (i.e., the risk that the SPV is unable to

- btain funding at a favorable interest rate to make lending profitable). This
situation then leads to the liquidation of an SPV by its lenders and is the
equivalent of a run on a bank.

From the inception of shadow banking up to 2008, investors viewed the

credit instruments issued by SPVs as having very little credit risk, as well as

having little funding risk. SPVs created by traditional banks were supported

by the bank with a line of credit. Moreover, the view was that in times of

credit stress, there would be indirect credit and funding backstops available

to bank-created SPVs, because a bank could draw on the public backstops

available to it through the Fed.

How important, as measured by liabilities, was the shadow banking

system? A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated that at its

peak, in 2008, the liabilities were \$20 trillion. The traditional banking

system at the time had liabilities totaling \$11 trillion. [10] Consequently,

shadow banking was not a minor sector of the financial system. In fact, the

same study estimated that the shadow banking system's liabilities had

surpassed those of the traditional banking system as early as 1996!

Difficulties regarding liquidity and asset valuations did occur at various

points after the inception of shadow banking. However, the difficulties were

resolved without impairing the growth of the shadow banking system. By

2008, however, several conditions in the financial market had precipitated a

major collapse of the shadow banking system. Specifically, asset valuation

declined for mortgage-related assets, and because a large portion of the

assets in which the SPVs invested consisted of such assets, the value of

SPVs declined. As a result, SPVs found it difficult to generate positive

returns on their asset portfolios. The problems in the financial market also

resulted in the tightening of credit, making it extremely difficult for SPVs to

- btain new funding once their short-term debt matured. All these events
underscored the vulnerability of the shadow banking system.

The conclusion of a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had the

following to say about the shadow banking system:

The shadow banking system has its benefits. It serves the same function as traditional banking but in

some areas maintains advantages due to superior market knowledge and specialization. Despite

declining shadow banking system holdings following the crisis, these entities are unlikely to

disappear soon. Given the continued presence, size, and risks, and the credit flows and economic

growth benefits that shadow banking facilitates, the proper dose and measure of reform is crucial.

Devising how to address vulnerabilities is no small task because of how the system has intertwined

itself with traditional banking, particularly with the large global banks. Realigning incentives will not

be easy. [11]

Key Points

```

- Depository institutions accept various types of deposits.
- With the funds raised through deposits and other funding sources,
depository institutions make loans to various entities and invest in
securities.

- Income is derived from investments (loans and securities) and fees.
- Because of the important role of depository institutions in financial
markets and the real economy, they are heavily regulated.

- Bank regulation refers to a federal agency's authority to issue specific
regulations and guidelines that govern the operations, activities, and
acquisitions of banking organizations.

- Bank supervision entails monitoring and examining the condition of
individual banks and determining whether they are in compliance with
regulations.

- Bank regulation has three components: (1) safety and soundness, (2)
deposit insurance, and (3) systemic risk.

- Safety and soundness regulation and supervision involve assessing the
likelihood of a depository institution's defaulting and, if a default does

- ccur, assessing the magnitude of the losses that will be realized by
creditors and stockholders.

- Bank examiners conduct on-site examinations with a focus on reviewing
and rating a bank's performance, financial condition, and regulatory
compliance.

- The system used to rate banks that has been adopted by federal bank
regulators is the CAMELS rating system, covering capital adequacy, asset
quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.

- There are two types of holding company structures in the banking
industry: (1) a bank holding company, in which the parent holding company
has as part of its holdings a national bank and a state bank, and (2) a
financial holding company, in which the parent holding company has as its
holdings a national bank and a securities company.

- Financial holding companies are conglomerates that are allowed to
engage in a wide range of financially related activities.

- The Federal Reserve is the primary regulator of all financial firms (bank
and nonbanks) designated as systemically significant; it also has safety and
soundness authority over the payment, clearing, and settlement systems that
are systemically important and are not regulated by other government
agencies.

- The Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and
supervises both national banks and federal savings associations.

- The OCC examiners are responsible for analyzing loan and investment
portfolios and funds management, rating banks, and determining
compliance with consumer banking laws for national banks and federal
savings associations with less than \$10 billion in assets.

- The Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) is an independent
federal agency that (1) insures deposits, (2) examines individual banks, (3)
supervises banks, and (4) resolves both troubled or failed banks and any
financial institution (bank or nonbank) that is designated as a systemically
important financial institution.

- If the OCC makes a determination that there is systemic threat to the
financial system, the FDIC has broad authority to utilize deposit insurance
funds to assist depository institutions.

- An important role of the FDIC is to provide a resolution when a troubled
FDIC-insured bank is about to fail.

- The FDIC assumes two roles in the resolution process: (1) as an insurer
- f deposits and (2) as a receiver and administrator of the receivership estate
for all creditors.

- The FDIC basically can use one of three basic resolution methods: (1)
purchase and assumption transactions, (2) deposit payoffs, and (3) open
bank assistance transactions.

- The Dodd-Frank Act extended the FDIC's receivership power and
authority to allow it to effect an orderly liquidation of troubled financial
institutions (banks and nonbanks).

- As part of its safety and soundness regulation, the amount of capital that a
bank needs to absorb losses must be determined. It is referred to as a bank's

capital requirements.

- Minimum capital requirements are established by regulators and then
applied by regulators in their supervisory role.

- A depository institution's capital is the amount of equity supplied by its
stockholders and is measured as the difference between the value of the

assets and the value of the liabilities.

- The various standards established by the Basel Accords link capital
requirements to the risks associated with the assets; hence the standards are
referred to as risk-based capital requirements.

- The underlying principle behind risk-based capital requirements is that
the riskier an asset is, the more will be the capital required to protect against
the risk of loss.

- Under the Basel Accords, the calculation of risk-based capital
requirements can be determined using either the standardized approach or
the internal rating–based approach.

- The Basel Accords are built on three pillars: minimum capital
requirements, a supervisory review process, and market discipline.

- The Basel Accords stipulate two levels of capital requirements: Tier 1
(core capital or basic equity) and Tier 2 (supplementary capital).

- Federal deposit insurance serves as a public backstop to prevent a run on
a bank.

- The three sources of funds for banks are deposits, nondeposit borrowing,
and retained earnings and sale of equity.

- Banks are highly leveraged financial institutions, meaning that most of
their funds are obtained from deposits and nondeposit borrowing (including
borrowing from the Fed through the discount window facility, borrowing
reserves in the federal funds market, and borrowing by the issuance of
instruments in the money and bond markets).

- Banks must maintain reserves at one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks,
according to reserve requirements established by the Fed.

- Banks temporarily short of their required reserves can borrow reserves in
the federal funds market or borrow temporarily from the Fed at its discount
window.

- Income-generating activities of bank can be broadly classified as
individual banking, institutional banking, and global banking.

- Thrifts are nonbank depository institutions; they include savings
institutions and credit unions.

- As with banks, thrifts can operate under federal or state charter and have
their deposits insured by a federal agency.

- Although there are differences between banks and thrifts in terms of the
activities in which they specialize and certain regulatory oversight, all
depository institutions have become more alike as a result of the DoddFrank Act and the adoption of the international capital standards required
by the Basel Accords.

- Savings institutions include savings and loan associations (S&Ls) and
savings banks.

- The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 gave the OCC enforcement authority over
federal saving associations and the FDIC authority over state savings
associations.

- To obtain a charter as a savings association, a thrift must pass a qualified
thrift lender test, which is based on the composition of the portfolio of its

assets.

- The primary assets of savings associations are home-related loans.
- Credit unions are depository institutions that have a "common bond"
requirement for membership and are owned by those members.

- The principal federal regulatory agency is the National Credit Union
Administration (NCUA).

- The three forms of credit intermediation are (1) nonintermediated, direct
lending, in which borrower and lender interact directly; (2) intermediated
lending through traditional banking, in which banks take in deposits and
lend them to customers (consumers, businesses, and governments); and (3)
market-based lending, which involves entities and activities outside the
traditional banking system.

- Market-based credit intermediation is referred to as shadow banking and
until 2008 represented a large sector of the credit market.

- Unlike traditional banking, shadow banking lacks regulation and the
backstops available to banks (deposit insurance, a lender of last resort) that
prevent a run on banks and protect investors.

- The legal entities created for the purpose of shadow banking transactions
are special-purpose vehicles (SPVs). These entities obtain their funding not
through deposits, as is done by traditional banks, but through a chain of
market-based transactions.

- The SPVs created for shadow banking transactions were often linked not
- nly to major banks but also to major investment banking firms and
insurance companies.

- The major risk with shadow banks is that because of the absence of
public backstops available to banks, such as deposit insurance and a lender

- f last resort, SPVs are susceptible to greater funding risk, which can lead
to the liquidation of an SPV by its lenders and is the equivalent of a run on
the bank.

Questions

1. In a March 17, 2009, speech titled "Finance: A Return from Risk,"
delivered before the Worshipful Company of International Bankers in
London, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England and chair of its
Monetary Policy Committee, stated:

Banks are dangerous institutions. They borrow short and lend long. They create liabilities which

promise to be liquid and hold few liquid assets themselves. That though is hugely valuable for the

rest of the economy. Household savings can be channelled to finance illiquid investment projects

while providing access to liquidity for those savers who may need it.

_United States_, submitted to Congress in January 2011:

In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections—the Federal Reserve as a

lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample regulations—to provide a bulwark against the

panics that had regularly plagued America's banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past

30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system—opaque and laden with shortterm debt—that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market—

for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of

- ver-the-counter derivatives—were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to
prevent financial meltdowns. We had a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards.

Explain what this passage means.

```
Appendix: The S&L Crisis

```

As indicated in main text of this chapter, although major legislation dealing

with depository institutions came about as a result of the 2008–2009

financial crisis, prior substantial legislation followed the financial problems

faced by S&Ls in the 1980s, referred to as the **S&L crisis** . This appendix

describes this crisis. It is worthwhile reading about the S&L crisis, because

it provides an excellent example of a poorly designed financial institution

that was from the outset likely to fail and cause substantial costs to U.S.

taxpayers.

The details of the growth of the S&L industry since the late 1960s and

the ensuing S&L crisis would fill an entire book, so only the basics of the

problems of this industry are presented here. Until the early 1980s, S&Ls

and all other lenders financed housing through traditional mortgages at

interest rates fixed for the life of the loan. The period of the loan was

typically long, frequently up to 30 years. Funding for these loans, by

regulation, came from deposits having a maturity considerably shorter than

the loans. Such a situation creates the funding risk of lending long and

borrowing short. It is extremely risky, although regulators took a long time

to understand it.

No problem arises, of course, if interest rates are stable or declining. But

if interest rates rise above the interest rate on the mortgage loans, a negative

spread results, eventually leading to insolvency. Regulators at first

endeavored to shield the S&L industry from the need to pay high interest

rates without losing deposits by imposing a ceiling on the interest rate that

would be paid by S&Ls and by their immediate competitors, the other

depository institutions.

However, the approach did not and could not work.

With the high volatility of interest rates in the 1970s, followed by the

historically high level of interest rates in the early 1980s, all depository

institutions began to lose funds to competitors exempt from ceilings, such

as the newly formed money market funds; this development forced some

increase in ceilings. The ceilings in place since the middle of the 1960s did

not protect the S&Ls, which began to suffer from diminished profits and

increasingly from operating losses. A large fraction of S&Ls became

technically insolvent as rising interest rates eroded the market value of their

assets to the point where assets fell short of liabilities.

Regulators, anxious to cover up the debacle of their empire, let these

S&Ls continue to operate, worsening the problem by allowing them to

value their mortgage assets at book value. Profitability worsened with

deregulation of the maximum interest rate that S&Ls could pay on deposits.

Even though deregulation allowed S&Ls to compete with other financial

institutions for funds, it also raised funding costs. Banks were better

equipped to cope with rising funding costs, because bank portfolios were

not dominated by old, fixed-rate mortgages, as S&Ls were. A larger portion

- f bank portfolios consisted of shorter-term assets and other assets whose
interest rates reset to market interest rates after short periods.

The difficulty of borrowing short and lending long was only part of the

problem faced by the industry. As the crisis progressed and the situation of

many S&Ls became hopeless, fraudulent management activities were

revealed. Many S&Ls facing financial difficulties also pursued strategies

that exposed the institution to greater risk in the hope of recovering if these

strategies worked out. What encouraged managers to pursue such high-risk

strategies was that depositors were not concerned with the risks associated

with the institution where they deposited funds, because the U.S.

government, through federal deposit insurance, guaranteed the deposits up

to a predetermined amount. Troubled S&Ls could pay existing depositors

through attracting new depositors by offering higher interest rates on

deposits than financially stronger S&Ls offered. In turn, to earn a spread on

the higher cost of funds, troubled S&Ls had to pursue riskier investment

policies.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - what a central bank is and the role of central banks;
   - the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the nature of the
Fed's instruments of monetary policy;

   - the meaning of required reserves for banks and the fractional reserve
banking system of the United States;

   - the implementation and impact of open market operations and of
   - pen market repurchase agreements;
   - the role of the Fed's discount rate;
   - the different kinds of money and the definitions of key monetary

aggregates;

   - the money multiplier and how it generates changes in the monetary
aggregates from changes in the banking system's reserves;

   - how banks and investors participate with the Fed in changing the
level of the monetary aggregates;

   - the goals of monetary policy, including price level stability, economic
growth, stable interest rates, and stable foreign exchange rates;

   - the operating targets of Fed policy (those monetary and financial
variables that are affected by its tools in a predictable way);

   - the intermediate targets of Fed policy (economic variables that the
Fed can affect indirectly through its work with operating targets);

  - why the federal funds rate and bank reserves have often been
   - perating targets of monetary policy;
  - how the broad monetary aggregates have sometimes served as
intermediate targets, as have certain interest rates; and

   - several aspects of global central banks.

In economies or groups of economies, the process by which the supply of

money is created is a complex interaction among several economic agents

that perform different functions at different times. The agents are business

firms and households who both save and borrow, depository institutions that

accept savings and make loans to firms, government entities, individuals and

- ther institutions, and the nation's central bank, which also lends and buys
and sells securities.

In this chapter, we explain the role of central banks in the complex

process of creating the money supply. To do this, we use the example of the

U.S. central bank (the Federal Reserve Bank or simply "the Fed") in the

creation of the supply of money to highlight its interaction with banks and

- ther units of the economy. We also explain the tools that the Fed can use to
manage the rate of growth in the money supply. We then examine the goals

- f monetary policy; that is, the conditions in the economy that the Fed seeks
to bring about. Although the Fed cannot directly cause these conditions to
exist, it can follow policies to target variables that it can influence with its
tools. We begin with a brief description of the role of central banks in
general and then focus on the U.S. central bank. We conclude with a
discussion of the issues related to global central banks.

```
Central Banks and Their Purpose

```

The primary role of a **central bank** is to maintain the stability of the

currency and money supply for a country or a group of countries. To be a

little more specific, let's look at the central bank of the United Kingdom, the

Bank of England. On its website, it identifies its role in financial stability as

follows:

**Risk assessment** : monitoring current developments both in the United Kingdom and abroad—
including links between financial markets and the wider economy and, within financial markets,
between different participants—to identify key risks to the financial system. For example, the Bank
examines the overall financial position of borrowers and lenders; the links between financial
institutions; and the resilience and vulnerability of households, firms, financial institutions, and
international financial systems to changes in circumstances. The Bank also conducts risk assessment
and research on the major developed countries and the main emerging-market economies.

**Risk reduction** : reducing vulnerabilities and increasing the financial system's ability to absorb
unexpected events. This can involve the promotion of codes and standards over a wide field, ranging
from accounting to improving legal certainty, and management of countries' external balance sheets.

**Oversight of payment systems** : oversight of the main payment and settlement systems in the UK that
are used for many types of financial transaction—from paying wages and credit card bills to the
settlement of transactions between financial institutions.

**Crisis management** : developing and coordinating information sharing within the Bank, with the FSA
and HM Treasury, and with authorities internationally to ensure future financial crises are handled and
managed effectively. In undertaking this work, the Bank advises on and implements policy measures
to mitigate risks to the financial system. [1]

One of the major ways that a central bank accomplishes its goals is

through monetary policy. For this reason, a central bank is sometimes

referred to as a **monetary authority** (e.g., Monetary Authority of Singapore,

Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Bermuda Monetary Authority). In

implementing monetary policy, central banks require private banks to

maintain and deposit the required reserves with the central bank (we discuss

reserve requirements later in this chapter). For this reason, a central bank is

also referred to as a **reserve bank** (e.g., Reserve Bank of Australia, Reserve

Bank of India, and South African Reserve Bank).

When discharging its responsibilities during a financial crisis or to avert a

financial crisis, central banks perform the role of lender of last resort for the

banking system. For example, the Bank of England states the following for

its role as lender of last resort:

In exceptional circumstances, as part of its central banking functions, the Bank may act as "lender of

last resort" to financial institutions in difficulty, in order to prevent a loss of confidence spreading

through the financial system as a whole.

The central banks of the 19 member countries of the Group of Twenty

(G20) countries are listed in table 7.1. Established in 1999 as an international

forum for finance ministers and central bank governors of developing

economies to discuss key issues of the global economy, the G20 includes 19

member countries plus the central bank of the European Union (the

**European Central Bank**, ECB). The ECB, which came into being on

January 1, 1999, is responsible for implementing the monetary policy for the

member countries of the European Union. The European System of Central

Banks consists of the ECB and the central banks of the member countries.

Also listed in the second column of table 7.1 are the names of the 19 major

central banks.

There is widespread agreement that the central bank should be

independent of the government so that decisions of the central bank will not

be influenced for short-term political purposes, such as pursuing a monetary

policy to expand the economy but at the expense of inflation. [2] As stated in a

speech by Frederic Mishkin, a former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve

Board of Governors, on April 3, 2008: "Evidence supports the conjecture

that macroeconomic performance is improved when central banks are more

independent." [3] He provides examples from the Bank of England and Bank of

Canada. [4] Moreover, this view is supported by several studies of central

banks of industrialized countries.

In 1975, as a result of the oil crisis and economic recessions being faced

throughout the world, the United States formed an informal meeting of

senior financial officials from five countries in addition to the United States:

the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The group, which

became known as the **Group of 6** (G6), decided to meet annually thereafter.

The following year, Canada joined the group, which then became known as

the **Group of 7** (G7). In 1998, Russia joined the group and it became known

as the **Group of 8** (G8). In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 and it

- nce again became known as the G7. Although the G7 can concur on
economic and financial policies and establish objectives, compliance is
voluntary.

The Central Bank of the United States: The Federal Reserve

System

```

The most important agent in the money supply process is the Federal

Reserve System, which is the central bank of the United States and is often

called the Federal Reserve or "the Fed." Created in 1913, the Fed is the

government agency responsible for the management of the U.S. monetary

and banking systems. Most large commercial banks in the United States are

members of the Federal Reserve System. The Fed is managed by a sevenmember **Board of Governors**, who are appointed by the president and

approved by the Congress. These governors have 14-year appointments

(with one appointment ending every two years), and one governor is the

board's chair. The **Chairmanship of the Fed** is a highly visible and

influential position in the world economy. The Federal Reserve System

consists of 12 districts covering the entire country; each **district** has a

Federal Reserve Bank that has its own president.

An important feature of the Fed is that, by the terms of the law that

created it, neither the legislative nor the executive branch of the federal

government should exert control over it. From time to time, critics charge

that the Fed guards this autonomy by accommodating either the White

House or Congress (or both) far too much. The Fed has substantial

regulatory power over the nation's depository institutions, especially

commercial banks.

It is worth noting here, before we discuss the Fed's tools for monetary

management, that financial innovations over the past two decades have made

the Fed's task more difficult. The public's increasing acceptance of money

market mutual funds has funneled a large amount of money into what are

essentially interest-bearing checking accounts. (See chapter 32 for more

information on mutual funds.) Another relevant innovation is the practice of

asset securitization, which we discuss in chapter 27. Securitization permits

commercial banks to change what once were illiquid consumer loans of

several varieties into securities. Selling these securities in the financial

markets gives the banks a source of funding that is outside the Fed's

influence. The many hedging instruments to be analyzed in part VIII of this

book have also affected banks' behavior and their relationship with the Fed.

In general, that transformation amounts to reduced Fed control of banks and

increased difficulty in implementing monetary policy.

```
The Fed and the Supply of Money

Tools of Monetary Policy to Influence the Money Supply

```

The Fed has several tools by which it influences, indirectly and to a greater

- r lesser extent, the amount of money in the economy and the general level
- f interest rates. These tools are reserve requirements (whose use is
somewhat constricted by congressional mandate), open market operations,

- pen market repurchase agreements, and the discount rate. These
instruments represent the key ways that the Fed interacts with commercial
banks in the process of creating money. Our discussion of these tools
explains the impact of their use on a generally specified money supply. Later
in this chapter we describe the money supply in more detail.

**`Reserve requirements`** Bank reserves play an important role in the U.S.
banking and monetary system and are directly linked to the growth in the
money supply. Generally, the higher the growth rate in reserves, the higher
the rate of change in the money supply. Later in this chapter, we discuss this
linkage in some detail. At this point, we want to focus on the meaning and
function of reserve requirements.

The United States has a **fractional reserve banking system**, which

means that a bank must hold or "reserve" some portion of the funds that

savers deposit in a form approved by the Fed. As a result, a bank may lend to

borrowers only a fraction of what it takes in as deposits. The ratio of

mandatory reserves to deposits is the **required reserve ratio** . For many

years, the Fed had the authority to set this ratio. In the Depository

Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980,

Congress assumed much of that responsibility, establishing new rules

regarding this ratio to be applied to all depository institutions, including

commercial banks, thrifts of various types, and credit unions.

In a key provision of the DIDMCA, Congress adopted a basic ratio of

12% for what are termed checkable or transactional accounts, that is,

**demand deposits**, or accounts on which checks may be written often. For

nontransactional but short-term deposit accounts—known as **time deposits**

- the required reserve ratio is 3%. The 1980 law also authorizes the Fed to
change the required reserve ratio on checking accounts to any level between
8% and 14%, and to raise it to 18% under certain conditions. In early 1992,
the Fed reduced the ratio to 10% for banks with total checkable accounts at

- r above \$46.8 million. For banks with smaller totals in these accounts, the
required reserve ratio is 3%. A bank must maintain the required reserves as
either currency on hand (that is, cash in the bank) or deposits in the Federal
Reserve itself. The more important form is the deposit, which serves as an
asset for the bank and as a liability of the Fed.

A bank has **excess reserves** if its reserves amount to more than the Fed

requires. A bank's **total reserves** equal its required reserves plus any excess

reserves. A bank whose actual reserves fall short of required levels can

borrow excess reserves from other banks (see chapter 25 for more on the

federal funds market), or it can borrow reserves from the Fed itself, which

we discuss later in this chapter.

**`Open market operations`** The Fed's most powerful instrument is its
authority to conduct **open market operations**, which means that the Fed
may buy and sell, in open debt markets, government securities for its own
account. These securities may be U.S. Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, or

- bligations of federal agencies. The Fed prefers to use Treasury bills,
because, in that large and liquid market, it can make its substantial
transactions without seriously disrupting the prices or yields of bills. When it
buys or sells, the Fed does so at prices and interest rates that prevail in these
debt markets. The parties to the Fed's transactions may be commercial banks

- r other financial agents who are dealers in government securities.

The unit of the Fed that decides on the general issues of changing the rate

- f growth in the money supply, by open market sales or purchase of

securities, is the **Federal Open Market Committee** (FOMC **)** . The FOMC

consists of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve

Bank of New York, and presidents of some of the other district Fed banks.

This committee meets approximately every six weeks to analyze economic

activity and levels of key economic variables. The variables may include

short-term interest rates (such as the federal funds rate), the U.S. dollar's rate

- f exchange with important foreign currencies, commodity prices, and
excess reserves, among other things. [5] After this analysis, the committee sets
the direction of monetary policy until the next meeting. This direction is
summarized in a brief "directive" at the time of the announcement after the

meeting. The minutes of these meetings are published at a later time.

The implementation of policy, through open market operations, is the

responsibility of the **trading desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New**

**York** . The desk transacts, in large volume, with large securities firms or

commercial banks that are dealers, or market makers, in Treasury securities.

Although the desk does not buy and sell for profit, it functions as a rational

investor, buying at the lowest prices and selling at the highest prices offered

at the time of the transactions.

Fed purchases augment the amount of reserves in the banking system. If

the seller is a commercial bank, it alters the composition, but not the total, of

its assets by exchanging the securities for reserves at the Fed. If the seller is

not a bank, much or all of the check with which the Fed pays will probably

be deposited in a bank. The bank receiving the deposit would experience an

increase in liabilities (the customer's deposit) and in assets (the growth in its

reserve account at the Fed). In either case, the proceeds from selling the

securities to the Fed raise the banking system's total reserves. Such an

increase in reserves typically leads to an increase in the money supply.

Individual banks whose reserves rise will generally make new loans, equal to

the new deposit less required reserves, because loans earn interest whereas

reserves do not. New loans represent growth in the money supply.

Conversely, the Fed's sale of Treasury securities reduces the money

supply (or its rate of growth), because the funds that security dealers pay for

the securities come from either deposits at banks or, if the dealers are banks,

from the banks' own accounts. A reduction in deposits reduces reserves and

leaves the banks less to lend.

**`Open market repurchase agreements`** The Fed often employs variants of
simple open market purchases and sales, and these are called the repurchase
agreement (repo) and the _reverse repo_ . The Fed conducts these transactions,
which are actually more common than the outright purchases or sales, [6] with
large dealers in government securities and, occasionally, with central banks

- f other countries.

In a repurchase agreement, the Fed buys a particular amount of securities

from a seller that agrees to repurchase the same number of securities for a

higher price at some future time, usually a few weeks. The difference

between the original price and the repurchase price is the return earned by

the Fed for letting the dealer have the cash for the life of the agreement and,

also, the cost to the dealer of borrowing from the Fed. In a reverse repo (also

known as a **matched sale** - r a **matched sale-purchase transaction** ), the

Fed sells securities and makes a commitment to buy them back at a higher

price later. The difference in the two prices is the cost to the Fed of the funds

and the return to the buyer for lending money.

An example illustrates some of the features in a Fed repurchase

agreement. (A detailed analysis of repos appears in chapter 25.) Suppose the

Fed wants to increase bank reserves for some reason over a short period of

time, and it seeks out a financial institution that has \$20 million in Treasury

securities but no excess reserves. Suppose further that the institution wants

to lend \$20 million for seven days to a borrower. After some discussions, the

Fed agrees to "buy" the securities from the institution at a price that reflects

the current repo rate, and to "sell" them back in seven days, when the

institution's borrower pays off that loan. The current annualized rate is 4.3%.

The transaction would look like this: The Fed would buy the securities for

approximately \$19,983,292 and sell them back, seven days later, to the

institution at the principal value of \$20 million. The difference of nearly

\$16,708 is the interest the institution pays for the seven-day financing and

the return to the Fed for lending that money. And for those seven days, the

financial institution and the entire banking system can enjoy an increase in

reserves, if, of course, the bank keeps the roughly \$20 million in its account

at the Fed.

The Fed uses repos and reverse repos to bring about a temporary change

in the level of reserves in the system or to respond to some event that the Fed

thinks will have a significant but short-lived effect. A particularly good

example of such an event is a large payment by the U.S. Treasury (as in tax

refunds or Social Security benefits) that sharply but temporarily raises

reserves at the banks. Of course, these temporary changes in the system's

reserves alter the banks' ability to make loans and, ultimately, to prompt

growth in the money supply for a short period.

**`Discount rate`** As mentioned in chapter 6, the Fed makes loans to banks
that are members of the system. A bank borrowing from the Fed is said to
use the **discount window**, and these loans are backed by the bank's
collateral. The rate of interest on these loans is the **discount rate**, set at a
certain level by the Fed's Board of Governors. As the rate rises, banks are
understandably less likely to borrow; a falling rate tends to encourage them
to borrow. Proceeds from discount loans are also reserves and increase the

banks' capacity to make loans. Banks generally do not prefer to gain

reserves in this way, because the loans cost money as well as invite increased

monitoring of the borrowing banks' activities. Accordingly, the flow of this

borrowing has a very slight impact on the money banks have and can lend

and, therefore, on the supply of money.

There is general agreement that the discount rate is the least effective tool

at the Fed's disposal, and its use in monetary policy has diminished over

time. Today, changes in the discount rate function largely as the Fed's public

signals about its intention to change the rate at which the money supply is

growing.

```
Different Kinds of Money

```

Until now, we have spoken in general terms about the money supply. But we

can be more precise and identify several different meanings of the word

"money" and several different types of money.

First of all, money is that item which serves as a **numeraire**, or unit of

account—in other words, the unit that is used to measure wealth. In the

United States, the numeraire is the dollar; in Japan, it is the yen; and so on.

Second, we call money any instrument that serves as a medium of exchange,

that is, anything that is generally accepted in payment for goods, services,

and capital transactions. In the United States, the medium of exchange

encompasses currency, which is issued by the Treasury or the Fed, and

demand deposits, which support payment by means of checks and are held at

depository institutions, such as commercial banks. The medium of exchange

also performs the function of being a store of value, which means that the

exchange medium can be used to carry resources over from the present to

the future. Obviously, this function is impaired in times of high and

unpredictable inflation. [7] Other accounts that resemble demand deposits

include the NOW account (or Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account) and

share drafts of credit unions.

Other assets that do not function in the role of medium of exchange have

many properties in common with the numeraire. These properties include

safety, divisibility, and high liquidity (which is the capacity to be

transformed into the medium of exchange promptly and at negligible cost).

Because of these properties, these assets are good substitutes for money, in

particular, as stores of value. The assets of this type include _time deposits_ at

commercial banks or thrifts. These accounts earn interest over their specified

lives, and the investor may not draw on the money in the account for a

transaction, without incurring a penalty, until the deposit's maturity date.

Other assets that are substitutes for money include balances in money market

mutual funds.

```
Money and Monetary Aggregates

```

Monetary policy and the actions of the Federal Reserve System often

concentrate on what are called **monetary aggregates** . The purpose of the

aggregates is to measure the amount of money available to the economy at

any time.

The most basic monetary aggregate is the **monetary base** . Also termed

"high-powered money," the base is defined as currency in circulation (or

coins and Federal Reserve notes held by the public) plus the total reserves in

the banking system. It is important to note that reserves make up the bulk of

the base, which is under the control of the Fed. Thus, this aggregate is the

- ne that the Fed is most able to influence with its various monetary tools.

The instruments that serve the role of **medium of exchange**  - currency

and demand deposits—are included in a monetary aggregate that is

sometimes referred to as the narrow measure of the money supply and is

labeled M1. Thus, M1 measures the amount of the medium of exchange in the

economy. M2 is a more inclusive aggregate, because it takes into account all

the instruments that substitute for money in the capacity of storing value.

Therefore, M2 is defined as M1 plus all dollars held in time and savings

accounts at banks and thrift institutions, plus all dollars invested in retail

money market mutual funds, plus some additional accounts (such as

- vernight repurchase agreements). Some analysts also watch developments
in two other monetary aggregates, which are labeled M3 and L (for liquid
assets). These aggregates (M3 and L) equal M2 plus certain other financial
assets, including long-term time deposits, commercial paper, bankers'
acceptances, and some Treasury securities.

The ratio of the money supply to the economy's income (as reflected by

the gross national product or some similar measure) is known as the **velocity**

**of money** in circulation. Velocity measures the average amount of
transactions carried by a dollar. If the economy's velocity were stable,
monetary policy could achieve any desired level of income by simply
targeting the aggregate. Unfortunately, velocity is not a stable relationship,
and in fact, the linkages between the economy's income and the various
aggregates vary considerably over time.

Typically, the monetary aggregates move in somewhat similar patterns,

rising and falling at roughly the same rates and at roughly the same times. A

major question in Fed policymaking (which we discuss below) has revolved

around choosing the most appropriate definition of the money supply.

```
The Money Multiplier: The Expansion of the Money Supply

```

Our discussion of how the supply of money is created focuses on the linkage

between the banking system's reserves and the aggregate M1. The process

we describe, the **money multiplier**, can be generalized to the other monetary

aggregates, but the complexities involved in those processes are not relevant

to our task now.

We begin by restating that the creation of the money supply and changes

in it are the result of complex interactions of four parties: the Fed, banks,

savers, and borrowers. The Fed provides reserves to banks and also requires

banks to hold, as reserves, a portion of the deposits that the public holds at

the banks. The banks, playing their key role in the money multiplier, lend the

remainder of the deposits (or most of it) to borrowers at an interest rate that

exceeds that of demand deposits. For any one bank, the remainder equals

deposits less required reserves, which can be expressed as deposits times (1

- required reserve ratio). Clearly, the funds one bank lends to a borrower can
become the borrower's deposits in another bank. The borrower's decision to
hold wealth as deposits rather than cash also affects the money multiplier.
Then, that second bank must keep a fraction of those new deposits as
reserves and can lend out to other borrowers an amount equal to the deposits
less required reserves.

We illustrate this process with an extended example. Suppose the Fed's

required reserve ratio is 12%, and deposits at Bank A are \$100 million, and

those at Bank B are \$50 million. Bank A has reserves of \$12 million and

- utstanding loans of \$88 million, and Bank B has reserves of \$6 million with
loans to borrowers of \$44 million. For Bank A, the loan amount to \$88
million equals either \$100 million of deposits less \$12 million of reserves, or
\$100 million times (1 − 0.12). For Bank B, loans of \$44 million equal \$50
million minus the 12% required reserves of \$6 million. Thus, neither Bank A
nor Bank B has any _excess reserves_ (which equal total less required
reserves). The level of reserves in the banking system has caused M1 to
reach the level of (let us say) \$900 billion, which equals \$250 billion in
currency and \$650 billion in demand deposits. For this example, we assume
that the amount of currency in the system does not change.

The Fed can increase the reserves by either lending to the banks or by

purchasing government securities from the banks or other investors. (We

ignore here the Fed's authority to change the required reserve ratio.) In this

example, suppose that the Fed buys \$5 million of U.S. Treasury securities

from a dealer who deposits the check, which is drawn on the Fed, with Bank

A. Bank A's reserve account with the Fed has increased by \$5 million, and

so have its (demand) deposits, its total reserves, and the overall level of M1.

But required reserves have risen only by \$600,000. This leaves an additional

\$4.4 million that the bank is free and eager to invest in order to improve its

income.

We continue by assuming that a machinery manufacturing firm borrows

all of the \$4.4 million in a one-year loan, then buys equipment from a

company that places all of that money in a checking account (or demand

deposit) at another bank, which is Bank B. Bank A must transfer reserves for

the amount of the loan to Bank B. The situation regarding Bank A is this: Its

level of deposits remains unchanged at \$105 million; its loans have

increased by \$4.4 million to \$92.4 million; its reserves have fallen by \$4.4

million (from \$17 million to \$12.6 million); so its ratio of reserves to

deposits is again the required 12%, and it has reached its capacity for making

loans because Bank A’s deposits are unchanged from their level of \$900.005

billion.

After the transaction, Bank B's deposits have risen by \$4.4 million, an

increase that raises the amount by an additional \$4.4 million (or \$9.4 million

altogether, so far) to \$900.0094 billion. Bank B has total reserves of \$10.4

million and excess reserves equal to 88% of the \$4.4 million in new

deposits. Thus, Bank B can lend \$3.87 million, keeping \$528,000 as required

reserves. If loans of \$3.87 million are made to borrowers who place those

loans as deposits with other banks, the process of creating money, in the

form of M1, will continue. Where will the process end, and what amount of

new money, in the form of new demand deposits, will arise from the new

reserves? In other words, what is the money multiplier?

In this example, the Fed's open market purchase of \$5 million of U.S.

Treasury securities, along with the banks’ incentive to make as many loans

as they are permitted to, has created demand deposits of \$9.4 million at the

first two banks involved. Still more deposits can be created at other banks.

This process will continue as long as other banks use the ever smaller

increases in demand deposits to make loans, which become additional

demand deposits and excess reserves at still other banks, and so on.

Although the process has no set limit in terms of time, there is a maximum

number of dollars in new demand deposits that will spring from the new

reserves.

This process is a form of a multiplier series that can be expressed in an

algebraic formula. If we let ΔTDD be the total demand deposits created, ΔR

be the reserves injected into the system by the Fed's purchase of Treasury

securities, and REQ be the required reserve ratio, then the total of new

deposits generated by the expansion of the initial injection of reserves would

equal:

Because there are many potential elements in this series, which can get

cumbersome, it is best to use this simple version of it:

In the example, REQ equals 12%, and ΔR equals \$5 million. Hence, new

total demand deposits (if banks lend as much as they can and keep no excess

reserves) amount to \$5 million/0.12, or \$41.67 million. The money

multiplier is, therefore, 8.33 ($41.67/$5). As a result, total will reach

\$900.04167 billion when the process is completed, which equals the original

\$900 billion plus \$41.67 million in new deposits. Equation (7.2) clearly

shows that the eventual amount of the new demand deposits is negatively

related to the required reserve ratio: As REQ falls, the change in TDD rises;

and as REQ increases, the change in TDD declines. Thus, if everything in

the example were the same, but REQ were 10% instead of 12%, the new

demand deposits would reach \$50 million.

Obviously, the process of reducing the money supply works in the

- pposite way. That is, if the Fed wants to drain reserves from the system and
reduce the banks' lending ability, it sells securities. The reduction in
reserves, as the public trades deposits for marketable securities, allows banks
to make fewer new loans or to renew fewer old ones.

```
The Impact of Interest Rates on the Money Supply

```

In chapter 15, we explain how changes in the money supply affect interest

rates. We note here only that interest rates actually influence the change in

the money supply. This point emerges from an evaluation of two key

assumptions made above. [8] First, banks are assumed to want to make all the

loans they can. If, however, banks were to keep some excess reserves, they

would make fewer new loans and generate fewer deposits at other banks,

which would affect the amount of M1 that the Fed's purchase of securities

would generate.

One of the important factors in a bank's decisions about excess reserves

is the level of market interest rates. High rates make excess reserves costly,

because they represent loans not made and interest not earned. If rates are

low, banks may keep some excess reserves. Hence, the level of interest rates

positively influences the amount of M1 that any increase in reserves will

create. Moreover, interest rates can also positively (but probably only

slightly) affect the amount of reserves in the system: High market rates may

prompt banks to borrow at the discount window in order to make loans, and

these borrowed funds are part of reserves.

By the second assumption, borrowers retain none of their loans in cash,

but rather deposit all cash flows—proceeds from sold securities, loans, and

so on—into checking accounts. In contrast, if borrowers took some of their

borrowings in cash, banks would receive fewer deposits and would have

fewer reserves from which to make new loans. Accordingly, the public's

demand for cash as a portion of its liquid wealth has an impact on the

amount of M1 that arises from the Fed's injection of new reserves.

The level of market rates shapes decisions about cash holdings. Many

deposit accounts pay interest, so holding cash imposes an opportunity cost.

The higher the rate is, the greater the cost will be, and the more money

investors will shuttle into deposits. But the rate on deposits is not the only

relevant interest rate. The desired amount of deposits, from which

transactions can be easily made, also reflects the rates of return from other

assets. As those returns rise, investors would hold more in deposit accounts.

For these reasons, the level of interest rates positively affects the size of the

money multiplier and, hence, the amount that any increase in reserves will

produce.

An example illustrates this point about the impact of rates on the money

multiplier and the change in the money supply arising from an infusion of

reserves by the Fed. The money multiplier from the previous example was

8.33 or 1/REQ, where REQ was 0.12. Let us now assume that the behavior

- f banks and depositors responds to interest rates. First, we will assume that
the rate of return on bank loans is such that banks do not make all the loans

they can but rather want to hold 1% of their deposits (TDD) in excess

reserves (ER), with the result that the ratio ER/TDD equals 0.01. Second, let

us suppose that the interest rate is at the level where the public will hold only

75% in checkable deposits (rather than 100% as before) and 25% in cash or

currency. This means that the ratio C/TDD is 0.33. With these assumptions,

the formula for the multiplier is now:

Plugging in the actual values, we have a much lower multiplier, which is:

Remember, this multiplier is reduced because households and banks do

not deposit or lend, respectively, all that they can, and these drains from the

money creation process reduce the multiplier effect of any increase in

reserves.

```
The Money Supply Process in an Open Economy

```

Our discussion so far describes central bank activity in what economists call

a

_closed economy_ . A closed economy is one in which foreign transactors—of

either goods or financial assets—play a negligible role. In the modern era,

almost every country has an **open economy**, where foreign firms and

investors account for a large and increasing share of economic activity. This

is especially true of the world's largest economy, that of the United States.

An understanding of the money supply process therefore must include the

influence of the foreign sector.

Monetarily, the crucial fact of significant foreign participation in the U.S.

economy is that foreign central banks, firms, and individuals hold a

substantial number of U.S. dollars. They do so for transactional reasons—

buying and selling goods and services in the United States—and for

investment purposes—treating the dollar as a financial asset. What makes

the foreign holdings of dollars important is that the dollar's exchange rate

with currencies of most developed countries floats according to demand and

supply in the market. (As explained in this chapter, most central banks,

including the Fed, try to keep exchange rates within politically acceptable

ranges.)

Shifts in the dollar's exchange rates affect the prices of domestic and

imported goods, the revenues of U.S. companies, and the wealth of all

investors in the country. As a result, the Fed accepts responsibility for

maintaining some stability in the exchange rates. A major way to discharge

this duty is to _intervene in the foreign exchange markets_ . (See chapter 19 for

more detail on foreign currency markets.) The Fed intervenes by buying and

selling foreign currencies for its own account. (Most central banks of large

economies own, or stand ready to own, a large amount of each of the world's

major currencies, which are considered **international reserves** .)

If the Fed thinks the dollar's value is too high and a foreign currency's is

too low, it can purchase some of the foreign currency with its own supply of

dollars. A purchase involves increasing the outstanding number of dollars

and thereby the monetary base. If the Fed thinks the dollar has too low a

value relative to some other currency, it might sell some of its holdings of

that currency for dollars. Thus, selling foreign currency entails a reduction in

the monetary base. Intervention in the currency market is often a response to

a particular international event. Moreover, the intervention usually involves

a transaction with other central banks, which consists of an immediate

exchange of currencies and an agreement for a future offsetting exchange.

Thus, this kind of action allows the Fed to know the terms by which the

currency deal will terminate and the time when it will terminate.

Our discussion of the elements of monetary policy in this chapter makes

it clear that the dollar's exchange rates with important foreign currencies

function as a major goal of monetary policy. That is, when forging and

implementing policy, the Fed considers the effect of a change in the money

supply on the relative value of the dollar in the foreign exchange market.

Dramatic evidence of the growing importance of international policy

coordination on monetary matters occurred in two meetings of central

bankers of the large industrial nations in the mid-1980s. In 1985, central

bank chairpersons and directors of the United States, Great Britain, France,

Germany, and Japan (known as the Group of Five) met at the Plaza Hotel in

New York. This is known as the **Plaza Agreement** . They agreed to

coordinate policies to bring down the value of the U.S. dollar and to stabilize

international exchange rates and trade. In 1987, at the Louvre Museum in

Paris, central bankers from these five countries and Canada agreed to work

together to keep exchange rates at their current levels. These efforts at

international cooperation on monetary and exchange issues are generally

seen as successful. [9]

```
Goals of Monetary Policy

```

By using such tools as open market operations (which change the reserves in

the banking system), the Fed can prompt the banking system and depositors

to implement desired changes in the money supply and in its rates of growth.

The Fed manages the money supply to achieve certain economic goals. In

this section, we identify some of the more commonly cited goals of Fed

policy. [10]

_Stability in prices_ is a major goal of the Fed. The standard way of

measuring inflation is the change in a major price index. Based on the

historical experience with inflation, policymakers and economists came to

appreciate how unstable price levels retard economic growth, provoke

volatility in interest rates, stimulate consumption, deter savings, and cause

capricious redistribution of income and wealth with attendant social

disturbances.

However, inflation in advanced economies is seldom (if ever) the result

- f excessive demand due to monetary or fiscal policy. A more important
source of inflation is an economic shock in the supply of a crucial material,
such as the oil shocks of the 1970s, which affected almost all countries.

Evidence that the inflation at the end of the 1970s was not related to

excessive demand for goods and services is that it occurred with high

unemployment and gave the world a period of **stagflation**, which is a

condition of both inflation and recession.

It is important to note that, when confronted with a supply shock, a

central bank such as the Fed has two choices. First, the banking authorities

can refuse to accommodate the higher price levels that follow the shock by

matching them with an increase in the money supply. The results of

nonaccommodation will initially tend to be higher interest rates and a

decline in economic activity. For this reason, central banks and political

authorities frequently have opted for the second choice, which is a policy of

accommodation and increased growth in the supply of money.

Unfortunately, this kind of policy permits the inflation to continue

unchecked or possibly to accelerate.

_High employment_ (or low unemployment) of the civilian labor force

represents a second major goal of the Fed. Although politicians often speak

- f the U.S. government's commitment to promoting "full employment,"
most people understand that an unemployment rate of zero is not possible.
The reason is that **frictional unemployment** - the temporary unemployment

- f those changing jobs or seeking new or better ones—is both unavoidable
and helpful to an economy. It is unavoidable, because people do change jobs
and are likely to do so more readily as employment levels rise, and because
workers are always leaving or entering the labor market. Frictional
unemployment is helpful, because it allows a constant reallocation of labor
and leads to increased efficiency in the workforce.

Given that zero unemployment is not a feasible goal, the appropriate goal

- f the Fed and other governmental policymakers is actually a high level of
employment. But economists and policymakers cannot agree on a suitable
definition or specification of high employment. It does not help to specify a
high level of employment as one that approaches 100% less the level of
frictional unemployment, because there is also little agreement on the true
rate of frictional unemployment. For practical purposes, many observers
consider that a civilian unemployment rate between 4% and 5% indicates an
economy operating at or near a level of high employment.

It is important to realize that high employment is one of the Fed's goals

because, in certain circumstances, the Fed's policy can indirectly influence

the level of employment. When the economy is operating sluggishly or

below capacity, increases in the money supply can bring about economic

expansion and employment, because those increases can reduce interest

rates, stimulate investment, encourage consumption, and lead to the creation

- f new jobs. A policy of expansion of the money supply is frequently

described as an "easy money policy," because the Fed is said to ease the way

for banks to acquire reserves and extend loans. But when the economy's

- output is close to capacity (given its stock of productive assets and
population), easy money policies can be disadvantageous, because they may
kindle inflation and raise interest rates. Policymakers must often wrestle
with the tough question of whether easing monetary policy will create higher
employment or simply ignite inflation, or an undesirable combination of
higher unemployment and higher inflation.

_Economic growth_, the third goal of the Fed, is the increase in an

economy's output of goods and services. Clearly, this goal is closely related

to the goal of high employment. As would be expected, there is little

agreement about the exact rate of growth that policymakers should try to

achieve. Variously described as "sustainable" or "steady" or "reasonable,"

the economy's appropriate rate of growth has to be substantial enough to

generate high employment in the context of an expanding workforce but low

enough to ward off inflation. The goal of stabilizing interest rates is directly

related to the goal of growth and the Fed's responsibility for the health of the

nation's financial and banking system.

Note that the goal is to stabilize rates, not to prevent changes in them.

Interest rates move up and down with changes in economic conditions.

Those movements can provide signals of important economic developments,

and it would be a mistake for the Fed to try to prevent such changes in rates.

However, the Fed may help economic conditions by trying to moderate the

impact of large moves in rates. Some increases in rates may reflect

temporary or reversible developments, and the Fed can appropriately

respond to these changes in a way that eliminates or greatly reduces such

increases.

_Stability in foreign currency exchange rates_ is the final Fed goal that we

will discuss. The foreign exchange market has become much more important

in recent years, as the economies of the world have become more integrated,

and foreign currency exchange rates have begun to affect ever larger

segments of the economy. Because exchange rates are clearly dependent in

some ways on the monetary policies of the major countries, the Fed has

accepted the goal of stabilizing foreign exchange rates. [11] Of course, some

fluctuations in exchange rates arise for economically sound reasons that

monetary policy in one country cannot influence or control. A prime

example is a pronounced difference in the fiscal policies between two

countries. In general, an important explanation of unstable rates among most

- f the world's major currencies has been the failure of the large industrial
economies to coordinate their fiscal and monetary policies.

A chief disadvantage of unstable foreign currency exchange rates is that

volatility in the prices of currencies inhibits the international trade that offers

a host of benefits to all participating countries. Furthermore, both high and

low exchange rates for the dollar are considered detrimental to the U.S.

economy. High exchange rates (i.e., a "strong" dollar or one with high value

in terms of foreign currencies) reduce demand for U.S.-made products

abroad and stimulate the import of foreign goods; the result is a trade

imbalance. A "weak" dollar contributes to inflation, as U.S. buyers pay more

for the many goods they do import. For these reasons, the Fed's goal of

stability in the currency market often amounts to keeping the value of the

dollar, in terms of the major foreign currencies, within some range that is

considered politically acceptable and helpful for international trade,

especially exports.

```
Trade-Offs and Conflicts among Policies

```

This account of the widely accepted goals of monetary policy reveals a

profound problem in the conduct of monetary policy. The goals are

numerous, but the Fed's capabilities are limited to the simple menu of (1)

trying to raise the rate of growth in the money supply by providing more

reserves to banks, and (2) trying to reduce the rate of monetary expansion by

reducing the reserves in the banking system. As a result, often one goal may

require a monetary policy that is inconsistent with some other goal. In other

words, a monetary policy that furthers progress toward one goal may

actually make attaining another either difficult or impossible.

For example, an easy money policy of expanding the money supply (that

is, stimulating higher growth rates for one or more monetary aggregates)

might appear to promote growth and low interest rates, but it might also raise

the prospect of inflation, affect the exchange rate disadvantageously, and

increase interest rates. Another example concerns the goal of price stability

and the Fed's responsibility for the health of financial institutions. Suppose

that, at a time of high inflation, many such institutions have invested

according to inflationary expectations and have made many loans to firms

dealing in real assets. Suppose, too, that the Fed decides it needs to take

steps to curb current inflation. In such a situation, the tight monetary policy

that accomplishes this goal—a policy of reducing the rate of growth in the

money supply—actually may imperil the institutions, because the policy

might well weaken the financial health of the firms that borrowed from the

financial institutions.

Economists frequently describe this problem in this way: The Fed's

policy necessarily represents trade-offs among its various goals, which have

different levels of relative importance at different times, depending on the

state of the economy. In other words, the Fed, like any monetary

policymaker, has numerous goals, but at any given time, it focuses on the

goal that is most in danger of not being achieved.

```
Goals and Types of Targets

```

A second problem in the implementation of monetary policy is that the Fed

has no direct control over the goals that are the final objectives of its

policies. The Fed cannot, with any of its monetary tools (open market

- perations, discount rates, etc.), directly influence such complex economic
variables as the prices of goods and services, the unemployment rate, the
growth in GDP, and foreign exchange rates. We know the Fed can affect the
rate of growth in the money supply only by means of its control of reserves
in the banking system. As discussed in chapter 6, the Fed cannot fully
determine changes in the money supply. The growth in the money supply
depends to a substantial degree on the preferences, actions, and expectations

- f numerous banks, borrowers, and consumers.

The Fed seeks to achieve its goals through a form of chain reaction,

which has the following chronology and structure. The Fed first employs one

- r more of its tools to affect what are called **operating targets**, which are
monetary and financial variables whose changes tend to bring about changes
in **intermediate targets** . Intermediate targets, which may include interest

rates or monetary aggregates, are variables that have a reasonably reliable

linkage with the variables, such as output or employment, that constitute the

Fed's goals or **ultimate objectives** . Thus, the Fed exerts whatever influence

it has on the intermediate targets in an indirect way, by means of its control

- ver the operating targets. So its power over the variables that make up its
goals is quite indirect and dependent on the linkages among the various
targets and goals.

Although economists have argued many years about the identity of

appropriate operating and intermediate target variables, there is no dispute

about the chief characteristics of a suitable operating or intermediate target. [12]

The first characteristic is _linkage:_ An operating target must have an expected

connection with the intermediate target, which itself must eventually affect

the economy in a way that is consistent with the Fed's goals. The second

characteristic is _observability:_ Both operating targets and intermediate

targets must be readily and regularly observable economic variables, so that

the Fed can monitor its success in influencing their levels or rates of change.

The third and final characteristic is _responsiveness:_ To function as an

- perating target, a variable must respond quickly and in an expected way to
the Fed's use of one or more of its tools; and an appropriate intermediate
target is one that reacts, in an anticipated way and a meaningfully short time,
to changes in the operating target.

**`Choosing the operating target`** In some countries, a key foreign
currency exchange rate may well function as an operating target. Although
the Fed has become more conscious of foreign exchange developments in
the past 15 years or so, it has not adopted the dollar's exchange rate with any
currency or group of currencies as an operating target. Instead, the Fed's
monetary policy has directly targeted either short-term interest rates or some
measure of bank reserves.

An important point about the operating target is that the Fed must choose

either a short-term rate or the level of some reserves and cannot choose to

target both kinds of variables. [13] To understand why the Fed must make a

choice, remember what the Fed's tools allow it to do. Those tools—whether

the secondary ones of discount loans and management of reserve

requirements, or the primary tool of open market operations—enable the Fed

to change only the level of reserves in the banking system. Obviously, a

change in reserves also changes short-term rates, because they are

determined in the interbank market for excess reserves. Under most

circumstances, the change in reserves is negatively related to the change in

interest rates: As the Fed supplies more reserves and banks gain more ability

to make more loans and buy other assets, the short-term rates fall; as the Fed

withdraws reserves and reduces the banks' lending capacity, the short-term

rates rise.

Because of this inverse relationship, it might seem possible for the Fed to

view each of these variables as a target and to set them all simultaneously.

But, in fact, that is impossible. The reason is that the Fed cannot know or

predict the public's **demand for money**, which is the aggregate demand for

holding some of its wealth in the form of liquid balances, such as bank

deposits. The public's desire to hold money depends on many factors,

especially preferences and anticipation about future income and price

inflation, among other things. Unexpected changes in those factors may well

shift the public's desired holdings in significant ways. Therefore, the Fed

cannot be certain how much impact any change in reserves will have on

short-term rates. Without knowledge of what the rate will be for a given

change in reserves, the Fed cannot simultaneously determine both the rate

and the level of reserves.

By choosing its operating target, then, the Fed makes the decision to let

the other variable fluctuate in response to changes in the public's demand for

money. When an interest rate is the target, the Fed must let the growth in

reserves vary as it strives to keep that interest rate at a certain level or to

smooth its transition to a new (higher or lower) level. When some aggregate

- f reserves is the target, the Fed is forced to allow interest rates to change
substantially, so that it can try to bring the level of reserves to that dictated
by the Fed's policy. Of course, the Fed can change its target from time to
time in order to rein in the variable that has fluctuated while the Fed focused

- n the other. But however often the Fed might change targets, it remains a
fact that, at any given time, the Fed cannot target both rates and reserves.

**`Choosing the intermediate target`** The best known of the intermediate
targets is the money supply, measured by one of the more inclusive monetary

aggregates that we described in chapter 6. In the 1970s, many countries

began to target the growth rates of one or more aggregates. The policy, at

least as publicly stated, was to supply reserves at a pace that would lead to a

selected rate of growth in the aggregates. The idea behind this policy was

that the goals of central bank activity—growth, stable prices, and so on—

would be realized if the money supply were to grow at a known and steady

rate. Over time, other intermediate targets have been specified, and they

include foreign exchange rates, the level of national output (such as the gross

domestic product), and the level of actual or expected inflation. [14]

Furthermore, the array of interest rates—including rates available to

consumers and investors—may also function as a target variable. We have

said that a prime characteristic of a suitable intermediate target is that it is

readily observable. Some of the candidates mentioned above do not fit that

rule: Information on the GDP, for example, is available only on a quarterly

basis, and measures of actual or expected inflation may be subject to

considerable dispute. [15]

Interestingly, in recent years, many central banks have adopted inflation,

despite certain problems in measurement, as a key intermediate variable. The

reason is that the monetary aggregates have not had the kind of reliable and

persistent relationship either with target variables or with goals that

policymakers require. In most European countries, policymakers follow

price indexes for sensitive commodities and make decisions about short-term

rates and bank reserves on the basis of actual and expected inflation. In the

United States, it is commonly said that former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan

carefully monitored the price of gold, among other commodities. Thus, the

purchasing power of the domestic currency and the foreign exchange rate of

the currency have become far more typical intermediate targets than have

monetary aggregates.

```
Global Central Banks

```

We conclude this chapter with a brief description of several aspects of global

central banks. The investigation of global bank regulation and supervision

was motivated by the global banking crisis of 2008. These banking problems

still plague many countries. Systemic banking crises have continued to

destabilize global economies since 1990. [16]

Measuring bank regulation and supervision around the world is, however,

difficult. Hundreds of laws and regulations, emanating from different

components of national and local governments, define policies regarding

bank capital standards, the entry requirements of new domestic and foreign

banks, bank ownership restrictions, and loan provisioning guidelines.

Table 7.2 provides information on the global commercial banking system

for four selected countries: Brazil, China, the United States, and the United

Kingdom. The information provided is the number of banks, the proportion

- f assets in government-owned banks, the proportion of banking assets in
foreign-owned banks, the number of official bank supervisors per bank in
the country, and the percentage of the 10 largest banks in a country that are
rated by one of the major international rating agencies. The high, low, and
median values for each characteristic shown in the table's last three columns

are for 180 countries. As can be seen, the range of these characteristics for

the global banking is significant.

systemic risk in the banking sector. The factors that regulators in most

countries consider most important are bank capital ratios and bank liquidity

ratios, whereas the least-often mentioned factor is stock market prices.

"Bank Regulation and Supervision in 180 Countries from 1999 to 2011," NBER Working Paper 18733

(Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, 2013).

Among the major findings for the 180 countries covering the period from

1999 through 2011 is the substantial heterogeneity of bank regulatory and

supervisory policies across countries. And, although there has been some

convergence for some types of banking sector policies, bank regulatory and

supervisory policies remain quite diverse. The diversity in regulatory

regimes provides an excellent opportunity for research examining the causes

- f these policy differences, the impacts of banking policies on the
performance of banks, and the related effects on the overall financial sector
and real economy. The last column in table 7.1 provides the ratio of public
debt to its GDP for the 19 countries whose central banks are shown in the

table.

```
Key Points

```

- The central bank of a country plays a key role in that country's economic
and financial markets by implementing policies to stabilize the currency and
controlling the money supply.

- The central bank may also act as a lender of last resort to the bank
system in order to avert a financial crisis.

- Evidence suggests that a central bank can act more effectively by
being independent of the government.

- The Federal Reserve System is the U.S. central bank.
- The Fed's tools of monetary policy include required reserves, open
market operations and repurchases, and discount loans to banks.

- The Fed supplies reserves to the banking system, which participates,
along with investors, in generating the money supply.

- The chief means of supplying reserves is open market operations:
The Fed's purchase of government securities provides reserves, and the
Fed's sale of securities reduces reserves.

- The money supply is composed of various types of money as well as
demand and time deposits, which can be grouped into monetary

aggregates.

- The fundamental aggregate is the monetary base, composed of
currency plus total reserves in the banking system.

- M1 equals currency plus all checkable deposits; other aggregates
include various time deposits.

- The money multiplier is the process by which changes in bank
reserves generate larger changes in the money supply.

- Banks use added reserves to buy assets or to make loans; the seller or
borrower redeposits these proceeds, which then support additional
loans, and so on.

- The value of the multiplier depends on the required reserve ratio, the
public's demand for cash, the banks' willingness to make loans, and the
level of interest rates.

- The growing international integration of economies requires that the
Fed, along with other central banks, consider the impact of its monetary

- perations on foreign currency exchange rates.
- The goals of monetary policy include a stable price level, economic
growth, high employment, stable interest rates, and predictable and
steady currency exchange rates.

   - Monetary policies involve difficult trade-offs, and policies that help
achieve one goal may make another goal less attainable.

   - Because the Fed has no direct control or influence on the complex
economic variables that constitute the goals, it must identify
intermediate targets that influence these variables and are, in turn,
influenced by operating targets that are variables the Fed can control to
a substantial extent.

   - The Fed's intermediate targets may be interest rates, monetary
aggregates, or possibly exchange rates.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the role of insurance companies as risk bearers;
   - the different types of insurance companies;
   - the fundamentals of the insurance industry;
   - the nature of the business of insurance companies;
   - how insurance companies generate income;
   - the structure of the insurance industry;
   - what reinsurance companies and captive insurance companies are;
   - the difference between a stock company and a mutual company, and
the advantages and disadvantages of each type;

   - the types of life insurance policies;
   - investment-oriented products offered by life insurance companies
(guaranteed investment contracts and annuities);

  - the difference between general account products and separate
account products;

   - the reasons insurance companies fail and whether they should be
treated as globally systemic important financial institutions;

   - the regulation of insurance companies in the United States and the
European Union;

   - the debate and evidence about whether insurers pose significant
systemic risk;

   - catastrophic risks faced by insurers, and strategies to mitigate those
risks;

   - what catastrophe bonds and insurance-linked securities are;
   - insurance company investment strategies;
   - the expansion of insurers into the pension fund area and banks (bank
insurance model); and

   - what insurance-based investment banking is.

**Insurance companies** provide (sell and service) insurance policies, which
are legally binding contracts. According to the insurance contract, insurance
companies (or simply, "insurers") promise to pay specified sums contingent

- n the occurrence of some specified future event or events, such as death or
an automobile accident. Thus, insurers are risk bearers. They accept or
underwrite the risk in return for a fee, referred to as an insurance premium,
paid by the policyholder.

Insurers are key participants in a country's economy not only as

suppliers of risk management products for a country's households,

businesses, and governments, but also as major investors. With the funds

available to invest from the premiums received, insurers are major buyers

- f the investment products described in later chapters, as well as
participants in the financial derivatives markets described in part VIII of
this book. They also provide investment-oriented products that we describe
later in this chapter. In addition to their importance in a country, they are
major players in the global financial markets with the concern that insurers
pose a significant systemic risk and whether major insurers should be

considered globally systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).

We'll address this issue later in this chapter.

```
Types of Insurance

```

Countries have different types of insurance policies that insurance

companies may issue. The classification of insurance companies in the

United States are life insurance, health insurance, property and casualty

(P&C) insurance, liability insurance, umbrella insurance, disability

insurance, long-term care insurance, and structured settlements.

```
Life Insurance

```

For life insurance, the risk insured against is the death of the insured. The

**life insurance company** pays the beneficiary of the life insurance policy in

the event of the death of the insured. There are several types of life

insurance policies, which will be examined later in this chapter.

```
Health Insurance

```

In the case of health insurance, the risk insured is medical treatment of the

insured. The **health insurance company** pays the insured (or the provider

- f the medical service) all or a portion of the cost of medical treatment by
doctors, hospitals, or others. This type of insurance has undergone
significant changes in the past two decades in many countries. As a result,
the health industry has been significantly restructured, so that the largest
health insurance companies specialize in health insurance rather than sell
health insurance in addition to other products, such as life insurance.

```
Property and Casualty Insurance

```

The risk insured against by a P&C insurance company is damage to various

types of property. Specifically, it is insurance against financial loss caused

by damage, destruction, or loss to property as the result of an identifiable

event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual. The major types of such

insurance are (1) a house and its contents against such risks as fire, flood,

earthquakes, and theft (homeowners insurance and its variants) and (2) a

vehicle against collision, theft, and other damage (automobile insurance and

its variants)

```
Liability Insurance

```

With liability insurance, the risk insured against is litigation, or the risk of

lawsuits against the insured due to actions by the insured or others. Liability

insurance offers protection against third-party claims, that is, payment is

usually made to someone who experiences a loss and who is not a party to

the insurance contract, not to the insured.

```
Umbrella Insurance

```

Typically, umbrella insurance is pure liability coverage over and above the

coverage provided by all the policies beneath it, such as homeowner,

automobile, and boat policies. The name "umbrella" refers to the fact that it

covers liability claims of all the policies underneath it. In addition to

providing liability coverage over the limits of the underlying policies, it

provides coverage for claims that are excluded from other liability policies,

such as invasion of privacy, libel, and false arrest. Typically, users of

umbrella policies have a large amount of assets that would be placed at risk

in the event of a catastrophic claim.

```
Disability Insurance

```

Disability insurance insures against the inability of employed persons to

earn an income in either their own occupation ("own occ" disability

insurance) or any occupation ("any occ"). Typically, "own occ" disability

insurance is written for professionals in white-collar occupations (often

physicians and dentists) and "any occ" is for blue-collar workers. Another

distinction in disability insurance is the sustainability of the policy, which

can be of two types. The first is guaranteed renewable (or guaranteed

continuable), whereby the issuer has to sustain the policy for the specified

period of time, and the issuer cannot make any changes in the policy except

to change the premium rates for the entire class of policy (but not for an

individual policyholder). The other type is noncancelable and guaranteed

renewable (or simply noncancelable), whereby the issuer has no right to

make any change in any policy during the specified period. Disability

insurance is also divided into short-term disability and long-term disability,

with six months being the typical dividing time.

```
Long-Term Care Insurance

```

As average life expectancies rise, older individuals have become concerned

about outliving their assets and being unable to care for themselves as they

age. In addition, custodial care for the aged has become very expensive and

in many countries may not be covered by some form of governmentprovided insurance for the aged. Thus, demand has surged for insurance to

provide custodial care for the aged who are no longer able to care for

themselves. This care may be provided in either the insured's own residence

- r a separate custodial facility. Many types of long-term care insurance are
available.

```
Structured Settlements

```

Structured settlements are fixed, guaranteed periodic payments over a long

period of time, typically resulting from a settlement on a disability policy or

- ther type of insurance policy.

For example, suppose an individual is hit by an automobile and, as a

result, is unable to work for the rest of his or her life. The individual may

sue the P&C company for future lost earnings and medical care. To settle

the suit, the P&C company may agree to make specified payments over

time to the individual. The P&C company may then purchase a policy from

a life insurance company to make the agreed-on payments.

```
Fundamentals of the Insurance Industry

```

A major task for the insurers is deciding which applications for insurance

they should accept and which ones to reject. The process of deciding which

.

application to accept or reject is referred to as the **underwriting process**

The insurance company must also determine how much to charge for the

insurance if it accepts the application. This activity is referred to as **policy**

.

**pricing**

Because insurance companies collect insurance premiums initially and

make payments later _when_ - r _if_ an insured event occurs, insurance

companies maintain the premiums collected in an investment portfolio that

generates a return. Thus, the two sources of income for insurance

companies include the underwriting income (the insurance premium) and

the investment income earned. The investment returns from the investment

- f the insurance premiums accumulate until the funds are paid out on the
policy. The premium provides a fairly stable type of revenue. Investment
returns may vary considerably with the performance of the investment
strategy pursued by the insurer's management. Consequently, an insurance
company's profits result from the difference between its revenue (i.e.,
insurance premiums collected plus investment returns) and its operating
expenses and insurance payments or benefits. The type of risk insured
against, which determines the level of premium collected and benefit paid,
defines the insurance company.

A fundamental aspect of the insurance industry results from the

relationship between its revenues and costs. A baker purchases ingredients,

uses these ingredients to make assorted bakery products, and then sells

those products, all in a fairly short time frame. Therefore, a bakery's profit

margin can be relatively easily calculated. In contrast, an insurance

company collects premium payments and invests them. The payments to a

policyholder on the insurance policy occur later and, depending on the type

- f insurance, often in an unpredictable manner. Consequently, the payments
are contingent on potential future events. For example, for life insurance, it
is certain that everyone will die. However, it is not known when any
specific individual will die. The timing of the payment on any specific
insurance company that sells insurance on an individual's life is not known
with certainty. Although the payments on any single life insurance policy
are uncertain, actuaries can predict the pattern of deaths on a large portfolio

- f life insurance policies, making the aggregate much more predictable in
terms of the patterns of death using standard actuarial tables.

At the other extreme, not only are payments on home insurance against

hurricanes singularly uncertain, but the payments on a portfolio of homes

remains uncertain as well. If one house in some geographical region is

destroyed by a flood, it is likely that many other homes will also be

destroyed. Thus, two important differences distinguish calculating the

profitability of bread manufacturers and of insurance companies. The first is

that the timing and magnitude of the payments are much less certain for an

insurance company. The second is the long lag between the receipts and

payments made by an insurance company, which introduces the importance

- f the investment portfolio and the generation of investment income.

These differences in the providers of a baked goods and insurance lead

to differences in the way consumers of bread and insurance view their

providers. Purchasers of baked goods are not harmed if the bakery goes

bankrupt the day after they buy the baked goods. The purchaser of baked

goods receives the product immediately, but the owner of an insurance

policy receives a payment on the insurance policy in the future only if an

insured event occurs, so the policy owner must be concerned about the

continued viability of the insurance company. Therefore, the credit rating of

an insurance company is important to a purchaser of insurance, especially

for the types of insurance that may be paid well into the future.

```
Structure of Insurance Companies

```

Based on the previous discussion, insurance companies are really a

composite of three companies. First, there is the "home office" or actual

insurance company. This company designs the insurance contract

("manufactures" the contract) and provides the backing for the financial

guarantees on the contract, that is, assures the policyholder that the contract

will pay off under the conditions of the contract. This company is called the

**manufacturer** and **guarantor** - f the insurance policy. Second, there is the

investment component that invests the premiums collected in the

.

investment portfolio. This is the **investment company**

The third component of an insurance company is the **distribution**

**component** - r the sales force. Distribution forces come in different types.

First, there are the agents who are associated with the company. Agents sell

- nly or mainly the company's own manufactured products. These agents
typically are not employees of the company (although some companies also
use employees as salespeople) but are entrepreneurs financially associated

with the company. There are also **brokers** who are not associated with any

company but sell the insurance products of many companies. Brokers have

traditionally operated individually but are increasingly operating in groups

called **producer groups** . In many countries, changes in regulations have

allowed commercial banks to become distributors of insurance products.

We describe this bank insurance model later in this chapter. The Internet has

also been used by some insurance companies to distribute insurance

products directly to clients. Internet distribution is very new and has

considerable potential but is still in its infancy. This mode of distribution

has been most successful in the more commodity-like insurance products,

such as term life insurance and automobile insurance.

These three components of insurance companies traditionally have been

combined in one overall company, but they are increasingly being

separated, and the three functions are being provided by different

companies. First, as previously mentioned, many insurance companies use

independent brokers or producer groups to distribute their products rather

than use their own agents. Many companies no longer have their own

agents and sell all their products exclusively through brokers, producer

groups, or on the Internet. Second, insurance companies are increasingly

- utsourcing parts of their investment portfolio or even the entire portfolio to
external independent investment managers. Investment managers are also
increasingly diversifying, that is, not specializing in managing any one type

- f assets (such as pension fund assets, mutual funds, or insurance company
assets) but are managing several or all of them. Third, although the home

- ffice component of an insurance company seems to be the core of the
insurance company, some home offices use external actuarial firms to
design their contracts. And, more importantly, they may reinsure some or
all of the liabilities they incur in providing insurance.

```
Reinsurance Companies

```

To reduce risk, insurance companies may reinsure some or all of the

liabilities they incur in providing insurance. Companies established for that

purpose are called **reinsurance companies** - r **reinsurers** . According to the

reinsurance transaction, the initial (primary) insurer transfers the risk of the

insurance policy to the reinsurer. The guarantee on the insurance policy is

thus provided by the reinsurer rather than by the primary insurance

company.

The five largest reinsurers in the world are Munich Reinsurance

Company; Swiss Reinsurance Company Limited; Hannover Re; Berkshire

Hathaway Inc.; and Lloyd's. The two larger reinsurers in Asia are Korean

Reinsurance Company and China Reinsurance (Group) Corporation.

```
Captive Insurance Companies

```

In chapter 2, we described how a company may decide to retain certain

risks. To insure against these risks, companies have established insurance

companies that they wholly own. The insurance companies created for this

purpose are referred to as **captive insurance companies** . These insurers

provide their owners a form of self-insurance and can provide for insurance

protection against any type of commercial risks that are provided for by

P&C insurance companies, as well as life insurance. In the United States,

the majority of Fortune 500 companies have established captive insurance

companies. In recent years, smaller companies have also created captives.

Worldwide there are about 5,000 captives. Even a government can set up a

captive. For example, the government of China created captive and marine

cargo specialties to establish captives for a few of its state-owned

enterprises.

There are several types of captives. Some of the alternative captives are

single-parent captives, association captives, industry captives, and

diversified captives. Most captives are **single-parent captives** - the

captives provide pure self-insurance for the parent company that created

them. **Association captives** are created by a trade association or members

- f an industry to provide insurance coverage for their members. Typically,
association captives insure against liability risks, such as medical
malpractice lawsuits. When companies in the same industry jointly create a
captive to deal with a specific insurance problem faced by the industry, the
captives created are referred to as **industry captives** . Captives that
underwrite unrelated risks in addition to the parent company's business are
referred to as .
**diversified captives**

There are legal jurisdictions where most captives have been domiciled

- utside of the home country of the company or association creating the
captive. These legal jurisdictions offer favorable tax laws, as well as
requirements regarding capitalization requirements, investment restrictions,
fees, and financial reporting requirements. The major ones are Anguilla,
Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Ireland (Dublin), Guernsey, Isle of
Man, and Luxembourg. In the United States, states have developed their

- wn regulations regarding captives for medical insurance as a result of The
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as
"Obamacare").

```
Stock versus Mutual Insurance Companies

```

Focusing on the United States, the two major forms of insurance companies

are stock and mutual. A **stock company** is similar in structure to any

corporation or public company. Shares (of ownership) are owned by

independent shareholders and are traded publicly. The shareholders care

- nly about the performance of their shares (i.e., the stock appreciation and
the dividends). Their holding period, and thus their view, may be short
term. The insurance policies are simply the products or business of the
company, and management is evaluated in terms of performance.

In contrast, a **mutual company** has no stock and no external owners.

The policyholders are the owners. The owners, that is, the policyholders,

care primarily or even solely about the performance on their insurance

policies, notably the company's ability to pay on the policy. Because these

payments may occur considerably into the future, the policyholders' view

may be long term. Thus, whereas stock companies answer to two

constituencies (their stockholders and policyholders), mutual companies

deal with only one, because their policyholders and their owners are the

same.

The reason for the existence of both forms of insurance structures has

been examined by economists. Organizational theory is the field in

management that tries to identify the organizational structure that provides

the most effective solution to the risk that a firm's managers will seek to

make decisions based on their own self-interest at the expense of the firm's

- wners. This is the principal-agent problem in financial economics: Agents
in the form of managers act in their own interest rather than that of the
principals in the form of owners of the company. One study that has looked
at the reason for the existence of the two structures for life insurance

companies notes the following:

The coexistence of stock and mutual companies in the property-casualty insurance industry suggests

that at least one of three hypotheses is true: the two organizational forms have competing advantages;

the market may be rich enough that different organizational forms can survive in different niches; and

the market may not have reached its final equilibrium (or perhaps history may influence the

equilibrium). [1]

At one time in the United States, the largest insurers operated as mutual

companies, but a number of mutual companies have converted to stock

companies, a process referred to as **demutualization** . The motivation for

demutualization is the need to obtain funding to support growth. When a

mutual company converts to a stock company, shares can be sold to the

public to raise funds, and stock can be used as currency to acquire or merge

with other insurance companies.

```
Types of Life Insurance Policies

```

Table 8.1 shows the five largest life companies in the United State, Europe,

and Asia as measured by total assets. Although different types of life

insurance policies are sold in different countries, we focus our description

- n policies sold in the United States. For this reason, it is important to
understand the impact of the U.S. tax code on certain types of insurance
production. The U.S. tax code allows for favorable tax treatment of certain
types of life insurance policies that have an investment feature. Specifically,
the buildup of investment income from certain types of policies is not taxed.
Neither is the beneficiary of the death benefit of a life insurance policy
subject to an income tax. Finally, the death benefit of the policy may or may
not be subject to estate tax, depending on how the beneficiary status is
structured. Consequently, life insurance products offer considerable tax
advantages.

aAs of March 31, 2017.

The two fundamentally different types of life insurance are term

insurance and cash value life insurance. In addition, other investment

- riented products are sold by life insurers.

```
Term Insurance

```

_Term insurance_ is pure life insurance. If the insured dies while the policy is

intact, the beneficiary of the policy receives the death benefit. If the insured

does not die within the designated period, the policy is invalid and holds no

value. No cash value or investment value accrues to a term insurance policy.

In addition, the policyholder cannot borrow against the policy.

```
Cash Value or Permanent Life Insurance

```

A broad classification of life insurance includes cash value or permanent or

investment-type life insurance, usually called "whole life insurance." [2] In

addition to providing pure life insurance (as does term insurance), whole

life insurance builds up a cash value or investment value inside the policy.

This cash value can be withdrawn and can also be borrowed against by the

- wner of the policy. Or, if the owner wishes to let the policy lapse, he or she
can withdraw the cash value. Growth in the cash value of the life insurance

policy is referred to as the "inside buildup." A major advantage of this and

- ther insurance products that offer a cash or investment value is that the
inside buildup is not subject to taxation.

Life insurance products can be complex. Only an overview is provided

in this chapter. The first of the two categories of cash value life insurance

policies discretizes whether the cash value is guaranteed or variable. The

second category deals with whether the required premium payment is fixed

- r flexible. The four possible combinations, shown in table 8.2, are
discussed here.

```
Table 8.2

```

Classification of cash value insurance.

Guaranteed Cash Value Policies Variable Life Policies

Fixed premium Whole life insurance Variable life insurance

Flexible premium Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance

**`Guaranteed cash value life insurance`** Traditional cash value life

insurance, whole life insurance, provides a guaranteed buildup of cash

value based on the general account portfolio of the insurance company. The

insurance company guarantees a minimum cash value at the end of each

year. This guaranteed cash value is based on a minimum dividend paid on

the policy. In addition, the policy can be either participating or

nonparticipating _._ For **nonparticipating policies**, the dividend and the cash

value on the policy are the guaranteed amounts. For **participating policies**,

the dividend paid on the policy is based on the realized actuarial experience

- f the company and its investment portfolio.

The cash value may be above but not below the guaranteed level for

participating policies. Thus, the actual performance of the policy can be

substantially affected by the actual policy dividends over the guaranteed

amount.

**`Variable life insurance`** Unlike the guaranteed or fixed cash value
policies, which are based on the general account portfolio of the insurance
company _,_ **variable life insurance policies** allow the policy owners, within
limits, to allocate their premium payments among separate investment
accounts maintained by the insurance company and also to shift the policy
cash value among the separate accounts. As a result, the amount of the
policy cash value and the death benefit depend on the investment results of
the separate accounts selected by the policy owner. Thus, this policy offers
no guaranteed cash value or death benefit, which depends instead on the
performance of the selected investment portfolio.

The types of separate account investment options offered vary by

insurance company. Typically, the insurance company offers a selection of

common stock and bond fund investment opportunities, managed by the

company itself and other investment managers. If the investment options

perform well, the cash value buildup in the policy will be significant.

However, if the policyholder selects investment options that perform poorly,

the variable life insurance policy will perform poorly, resulting in little or

no cash value buildup, or, in the worst case, the termination of the policy.

**`Universal life and variable universal life insurance`** The key
element of **universal life insurance** is the flexibility of the premium for the
policyholder. This flexible premium concept separates pure insurance
protection (term insurance) from the investment (cash value) element of the
policy. The policy cash value is set up as the cash value fund (or
accumulation fund), to which the investment income is credited and from
which the cost of term insurance for the insured (the mortality charge) is
debited. Expenses are also debited.

This separation of the cash value from the pure insurance is called the

**unbundling** - f the traditional life insurance policy. Premium payments for

universal life are at the discretion of the policyholder, except for a minimum

initial premium to begin the coverage and then at least enough cash value in

the policy each month to cover the mortality charge and other expenses. If

not covered, the policy will lapse. Both guaranteed cash value and variable

life can be written on a flexibleor a fixed-premium basis.

```
Other Investment-Oriented Insurance Products

```

Life insurers increasingly offer products with a significant investment

component in addition to their insurance component: guaranteed investment

contracts and annuities.

**`Guaranteed`** **`investment`** **`contracts`** Insurance companies have
increasingly sold products that have a significant investment component in
addition to their insurance component. The first major investment-oriented
product developed by life insurance companies was the **guaranteed**
**investment contract** (GIC). According to a GIC, a life insurance company
agrees, in return for a single premium, to pay the principal amount and a
predetermined annual crediting rate over the life of the investment, all paid
at the maturity date of the GIC. For example, a \$10 million, five-year GIC
with a predetermined crediting rate of 10% means that at the end of five
years, the insurance company pays the guaranteed crediting rate and the
principal. The risk to the customer is that the return of the principal depends

- n the ability of the life insurance company to satisfy the obligation, just as
in any corporate debt obligation. The risk that the insurer faces is that the
rate earned on the portfolio of supporting assets is less than the guaranteed
rate paid to the customer.

The maturity of a GIC can vary from one year to 20 years. The interest

rate guaranteed depends on market conditions and the rating of the life

insurance company. The interest rate will be higher than the yield of the

country's risk-free rate for the same maturity. These policies are purchased

by individuals and by pension plan sponsors as a pension investment and, as

explained in chapter 9, by one type of pension fund, a defined pension fund,

to "derisk" their obligations.

A GIC is nothing more than the debt obligation of the life insurance

company issuing the contract. The word "guarantee" does not mean that

there is a guarantor other than the life insurance company. Effectively, a

GIC is a zero-coupon bond issued by a life insurance company and, as such,

exposes the investor to the same credit risk. This credit risk has been

highlighted by the default of several major issuers of GICs. The two most

publicized in the United States were Mutual Benefit, a New Jersey–based

insurer, and Executive Life, a California-based insurer, which were both

seized by regulators in 1991.

**`Annuity`** Another insurance company investment product is an annuity. In
the United States, an annuity is often described as "a mutual fund in an
insurance wrapper." (Mutual funds are discussed in chapter 32.) What does
this mean? To answer this question, assume that an insurance company
investment manager has two identical common stock portfolios, one in a
mutual fund and the other in an annuity. For the mutual fund, all income
(that is, the dividend) is taxable, and the capital gains (or losses) realized by
the fund are also taxable, although at potentially different tax rates. The
income and realized gains are taxable whether they are withdrawn by the
mutual fund holder or reinvested in the fund. There are no guarantees
associated with the mutual fund; its performance depends solely on the
portfolio performance.

Because of the insurance wrapper, discussed below, an annuity in the

United States is treated as an insurance product; as a result, it receives

preferential tax treatment. Specifically, the income and realized gains are

not taxable if not withdrawn from the annuity product. Thus, the "inside

buildup" of returns is not taxable on an annuity, as it is also true for other

cash value insurance products. At the time of withdrawal, however, all the

gains are taxed at ordinary income rates.

The insurance wrapper on the mutual fund that makes it an annuity can

be of various forms. The most common wrapper is the guarantee by the

insurance company that the annuity policyholder will get back no less than

the amount invested in the annuity (there may also be a minimum period

before withdrawal to get this benefit). Thus, if an investor invests \$100 in a

common stock–based annuity, and at the time of withdrawal (or at the time

- f death of the annuity holder) the annuity has a value of only \$95, the
insurance company will pay the annuity holder (or its beneficiary) \$100.
Many other types of protection or insurance features have also been
developed.

Of course, insurance companies impose a charge for this insurance

benefit—an insurance premium for the insurance component of the annuity.

Thus, whereas mutual funds have an expense fee imposed on the fund's

performance, an annuity has a **mortality and expense fee** imposed.

Therefore, annuities are more expensive to the investor than are mutual

funds. In return, annuity policyholders get the insurance wrapper, which

provides the tax benefit. Annuities can be either fixed annuities (similar to

GICs) or variable annuities whose performance is based on the return of a

common stock or bond portfolio.

```
General Account and Separate Account Products

```

The general account of an insurance company refers to the investment

portfolio of the overall company. Products "written by the company itself "

generally carry a "general account guarantee," that is, they are a liability of

the insurance company. When the credit rating agencies (e.g., Moody's,

Standard & Poor's, Fitch) provide a credit rating, they do so on products

written or guaranteed by the general account. Such ratings are on the

claims-paying ability of the company. Typical products written or

guaranteed by the general account are whole life, universal life, and fixed

annuities (including GICs). Insurance companies must support the

guaranteed performance of their **general account products** to the extent of

their solvency.

Other types of insurance products receive no guarantee from the

insurer's general account, and their performance is not based on the

performance of the insurance company's general account but solely on the

performance of an account separate from the general account, often an

account selected by the policyholder. These products are called **separate**

**account products** . Variable life insurance and variable annuities are

separate account products. The policyholder chooses specific portfolios to

support these products. The performance of the insurance product depends

almost solely on the performance of the portfolio selected, adjusted for the

fees or expenses of the insuring company.

**`Participating policies`** The performance of separate account products
depends on the performance of the separate account portfolio chosen and is
not affected by the performance of the overall insurance company's general
account portfolio. In addition, the performance of some general account

products is not affected by the performance of the general account portfolio.

For example, disability income insurance policies may be written on a

general account, and even though their payoff depends on the solvency of

the general account, the policy performance (e.g., its premium) does not

participate in the investment performance of the insurance company's

general account investment portfolio.

Other general account insurance products participate in the performance

- f the company's general account investment portfolio. For example, a life
insurance company provides the guarantee of a minimum dividend on its
whole life policies, but the policies' actual dividends may increase if the
investment portfolio performs well. This "interest component" of the
dividend exists in tandem with the expense and mortality components.
Thus, the performance of the insurance policy participates in the overall
company's performance. Such a policy is called a **participating policy**, in
this case, a participating whole life insurance policy.

```
Captive Reinsurance Arrangements by Life Insurers

```

Earlier we described captive insurance companies. Although the original

captives were created by noninsurance entities, life insurers have been

creating captives to circumvent some recent regulatory requirements. In

contrast to the use of captives by noninsurance entities for providing a form

- f self-insurance, captives owned by life insurers are simply risk transfer
vehicles for a given life insurer. [3] The structures created by life insurers are
referred to as reinsurance captives, even though the risk is not transferred to
an independent insurer. As a result, there has been considerable debate
about such captives. In a report by the New York State Department of
Financial Services published in June 2013, they are referred to as "shadow
insurance" arrangements, because they hide the financial weakness of the
sponsoring life insurer and increase the broader financial system's systemic
risk.

There are two views on the use by life insurers of captive reinsurance

arrangements. One view is that captive reinsurance arrangements are an

efficient vehicle for a life insurer to manage statutory capital for some its

products. The benefit to the consumer is that it results in lower premiums

than would be possible in the absence of such an arrangement and more

insurance protection without the insurer increasing the risk of insolvency.

The other view is that insolvency risk is significantly higher for life insurers

using a captive reinsurance arrangement than implied by the parent

insurer's current credit ratings, producing a substantial expected cost of

default for the industry. This view is supported by an empirical study by

Koijen and Yogo. [4]

```
Regulation of Insurance Companies

```

Every country has its own system for regulating insurers. In fact, even

within a country, regional regulators may have their own regulatory system.

The United States is the prime example of this, with each state regulating

insurance companies. In the European Union, every member country has its

- wn regulatory system.

```
International Association of Insurance Supervisors

```

Before describing the U.S. insurance regulatory system, it is worthwhile to

describe global efforts to regulate the insurance industry. The International

Association of Insurance Supervisors is a voluntary membership

- rganization representing insurance regulators and supervisors from 140
countries that make up 97% of the world's insurance premiums. Formed in
1994, the two objectives of the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors are to

- Promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop
and maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit and protection of policyholders;
and to

- Contribute to global financial stability. [5]

Three activities are undertaken by the International Association of

Insurance Supervisors to achieve its objectives. The first activity is to

establish principles, standards, and guidance for effective insurance

supervision. The second is to promote the implementation of its supervisory

principles and standards by international organizations, regional groups, and

supervisors. The third is to play a key role in financial stability issues,

which includes developing a methodology for the identification of global

systemically important insurers and policy measures to address their

systemic risks.

One of the principal objectives of regulation of insurers is to reduce the

risk of insolvency. So we begin with a brief history of reasons for failures of

insurers, limiting our discussion to U.S. insurers.

```
Reasons for Failures of Insurers

```

For insurers, failure means to (1) default, (2) be liquidated, (3) be taken

- ver by regulators, or (4) obtain external support to avoid the first three
kinds of failure. The causes of failure were reported in a study by Standard
& Poor's in an effort to improve on the way in which the rating company
formulates its criteria for rating insurers. [6] The study, which looked at failure
since the 1980s throughout the world, found that the following key factors

were present:

   - poor liquidity management,
   - underpricing and underreserving,
   - a high tolerance for investment risk,
   - management and governance issues,
   - difficulties related to rapid growth and/or expansion into noncore
activities, and

   - sovereign-related risks. [7]

The first two factors listed were the principal reasons for the failure of U.S.

insurers.

Poor liquidity management led to the failure of some U.S. life insurance

companies from 1991 to 1994, including First Executive Corporation,

Executive Life Insurance Company of California, First Capital Holdings

Corporation, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, Monarch Life

Insurance Company, Kentucky Central Life Insurance Company, and

Confederation Life Insurance Company. The liquidity problem for these

failed companies arose from an overconcentration in illiquid assets that

could not be used to satisfy the insurer's liabilities.

The overconcentration in illiquid assets for some of the failed life

insurers were:

   - Mutual Benefit: real estate developments;
   - Executive Life Insurance Company: illiquid high-yield bonds and
hybrid capital securities;

   - Monarch Life: Real estate equity investments; and
   - Kentucky Central and Confederation: mortgage loans on commercial
real estate, including construction loans on new developments and
high loan-to-value mortgages.

The liquidity issue faced by these life insurers was much like the run-onthe-bank scenario faced by depository institutions.

Liquidity-driven problems were also faced in 1999 by life insurers that

issued GIC policies, which we described earlier. As explained, most GIC

products allow policyholders to surrender or cash out their policy. The

surrender rate for GICs was so high in 1999 that it led to the failure of five

life insurers: GenAmerica Financial Corporation, General American Life

Insurance Company, ARM Financial Group Inc., Integrity Life Insurance

Company, and RGA Reinsurance Company.

From 1984 to 1989, several U.S. insurers, mostly P&C insurers, became

insolvent for the second reason listed: the loss reserves proved deficient

following a period of inadequate pricing. The insurers included Mission

Insurance Company and Transit Casualty Insurance Company.

Of course, there were also the "near misses"—instances in which

external support prevented the collapse of an insurer. The best-known case

- f external support was the federal government's bailout of the American
International Group (AIG). AIG had followed an overly aggressive
investment strategy using the leverage provided by credit derivatives, a
derivative product described in chapter 39. We described the 2008 federal
government bailout of AIG in chapter 2.

```
U.S. Regulatory System

```

Regulation of U.S. insurers is governed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act of

1945, which grants states the right to regulate the business of insurance.

There is a state-based regulatory system of insurers. Insurance companies

whose stock is publicly traded are also regulated by the SEC.

Although the primary insurance regulators are at the state level, the

federal government is also involved. The main involvement relates to

federal programs for dealing with risks that are difficult for private

insurance companies to insure.

**`The current state-based regulatory system`** All states have an
insurance department that is either part of a state financial regulatory
department or an independent state agency. The head of the insurance
regulatory department, typically referred to as the insurance commissioner,
is either appointed by the state's governor or elected. For example, in the
state of Michigan, the regulatory agency responsible for insurance (as well
as for banking and securities markets) is the Office of Financial and
Insurance Regulation, which is part of that state's Department of Energy,
Labor and Economic Growth, and the commissioner is appointed by the
governor. In the state of New York, the Insurance Division is part of that
state's Department of Financial Services. Before October 2011, New York
State had a stand-alone agency, the New York State Insurance Department.
The state's Department of Financial Services was formed by combining the
New York State Insurance Department and the New York State Banking
Department.

Insurance regulation deals with solvency regulation and consumer

protection. Solvency regulation is the same as what we discussed in chapter

6 with respect to bank regulation—safety and soundness regulation. State

laws regarding solvency regulation deal with (1) capital requirements and

reserves, (2) permissible investments, and (3) general and separate

accounts. Licensing of and standards of conduct for participants in the

insurance business and the approval of products developed by insurers are

the focus of consumer protection regulation.

The relationship between the premium revenues and the eventual

contingent contractual insurance policy payments bears on an important

aspect of evaluating insurance companies. Accountants and auditors, credit

rating agencies, and government regulators all monitor insurance

companies. These monitors watch the financial stability of the insurance

companies based on, among other things, the level of synchronicity

between the premiums and insurance policy payments and also the

volatility of the payments. To ensure an insurer's financial stability, these

monitors require insurance companies to maintain reserves or surplus,

consisting of the excess of assets over liabilities. Regulators and

accountants define these reserves or surpluses differently and refer to them

by different names. Because state statutes establish the treatment of both

assets and liabilities for insurance companies, a surplus is also known as

**reserves**
**statutory surplus** (or ), or STAT surplus. Generally accepted
accounting principles surplus (or reserves) is defined by accountants for
their purposes. Statutory and GAAP reserves are measured differently, but
their purposes are similar, though not identical. Statutory surplus is
important because regulators view it as the ultimate amount that can be
drawn on to pay policyholders. The growth of this surplus for an insurance
company also determines how much future business it can underwrite.

Defining assets is straightforward; defining liabilities is more difficult.

The complication in determining the value of liabilities arises because the

insurance company commits to making payments at some time in the

future, and those future payments are recorded as contingent liabilities on

its financial statement. The reserves are simply an accounting entry, not an

identifiable portfolio.

Model laws and regulations are developed by the National Association

- f Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a private voluntary association
composed of state insurance commissioners. Adoption of a model law or
regulation by the NAIC is not binding on any state. However, states
typically use these guidelines when writing their own laws and regulations.
The NAIC seeks to foster uniformity of regulation, the lack of which in the
current system has drawn major criticism and provided one of the
arguments for moving primary regulation from the states to the federal
government. Although the adoption of model laws is not binding, the NAIC
does have some power granted to it by every state and by the federal
government. For example, every state has adopted a law that requires
insurers to file financial statements prepared on forms developed by the

NAIC and to use the NAIC's calculation methodology to compute riskbased capital requirements.

Insurance companies are typically rated by credit rating agencies (e.g.,

Moody's, Standard & Poor's, A. M. Best Company, Fitch) with respect to

both their ability to pay claims and their outstanding debt, if any. Equity

analysts who work at investment banks and broker-dealers also evaluate the

attractiveness of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded insurance

companies.

**`Current and potential regulation by the federal government`** As
with depository institutions, regulators impose capital requirements on
insurance companies. As just explained, in the case of insurers, capital
requirements are set by state regulators; consequently, capital requirements
vary by state. This is in stark contrast to the regulatory framework dealing
with insurers in other countries, developed and emerging, where regulation
takes place at the national level. Moreover, there is no actual authority or
governmental power requiring states regulators to act on the NAIC model
laws and regulations.

Proposals have been made to change the current system of regulation at

the state level and to add greater regulation at the federal level, making a

federal agency the lead insurance regulator. The argument for doing so is

that it could eliminate regulatory inconsistencies across states. Proponents

point out that this form of regulation would allow coordination with other

federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC.

Proponents of the current system of state regulations point to the stellar

performance of insurers during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Whereas

federally regulated banks required a bailout, with the exception of the

American International Group, whose actions required a government

bailout (described in chapter 2), the insurance industry fared well.

The need for regulatory reform of the insurance industry was recognized

by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,

which took the first step toward federal oversight. Title V (Insurance) of

this act established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) as a branch of the

Treasury Department. The FIO is responsible for all insurance except health

care and most long-term care. The FIO was given limited authority to

eliminate duplicative state regulation, coordinate with international

authorities on insurance matters, and to report to Congress on attributes of

the current U.S. regulatory system and how it could be modernized.

In executing its charge to assess and recommend ways to modernize

insurance regulations, the FIO drew on a 2011 study titled "Modernizing

Insurance Regulation in the United States," [8] popularly referred to as the

Cluff Fund Report. The recommendations in that report dealt with the

problems inherent in the current state-based system, which was described as

"fragmented, inconsistent and inefficient" and something that could only be

dealt with by regulation at the federal level. The near-term

recommendations for changes in the regulatory structure are for a better

coordinating role for the FIO and improvements to state regulations. The

midto long-term recommendations for a regulatory framework for national

standards are the following:

   - Keep the existing state-based regulatory framework, but foster
through state action more uniform national standards.

   - Establish federally enforced state "passports," whereby states would
be limited in their ability to refuse recognition of an insurer domiciled
in another state.

   - Establish direct federal oversight and regulation of insurance.

```
EU Regulatory Approach

```

The first insurance regulations for members of the European Union were

enacted in 1994. The primary concern of the regulation was protecting

consumers by focusing on insurance products and pricing policies.

Solvency was not officially addressed by the EU legislative program,

Solvency I Directive, which sought to harmonize the insurance regulatory

regime for EU members.

On January 1, 2016, the European Union adopted new regulations,

Solvency II Directive, that replaced 14 insurance directives. The principal

- bjectives of the Solvency II Directive (in addition to providing enhanced
consumer protection) are to give policyholders greater confidence in the

products of insurers, harmonize regulatory regimes, and modernize

supervision. The "Supervisory Review Process" required by the Solvency II

Directive shifts the focus of regulators from compliance monitoring and

capital to evaluating the risk profiles and the quality of insurers' risk

management and governance systems. Thus, the Solvency II Directive was

not just about capital requirements for insurers but also about authorization,

corporate governance, supervisory reporting, public disclosure, risk

assessment and management, and solvency and capital reserves.

When comparing the EU and U.S. approaches to insurance regulations,

the authors of one study argue that the EU approach is more "fluid and

principles-based" than the approach taken by the United States. [9] By a

"flexible" approach, the authors mean that risk-based capital standards

imposed on insurers are used as guidelines for insurers rather than as

absolute standards. [10] By providing greater flexibility, it is argued that

insurers can develop strategies to deal with risk that can reduce the

possibility of the insurance industry adding to systemic risk. Moreover, the

authors of the study point out that the EU approach has been more

successful in promoting an insurance industry that is financially strong

according to empirical studies.

```
Insurers and Global SIFIs

```

There has been a debate as to whether the importance of large insurers can

cause systemic risk events that adversely impact a country's financial

market or even the global financial market. The potential for insurers to

create systemic risk events was brought to light by one major life insurer,

America International Group (AIG), because of its losses in the financial

derivatives markets, more specifically, credit default swaps (the subject of

chapter 39).

A report by the Geneva Association consists of several papers on the

differences between banks and insurers and what the differences mean for

systemic risk and other implications for regulators. [11] Despite both banks and

insurers being financial intermediaries willing to accept the transfer of risks

from other market participants, the risks faced by banks and insurance

companies differ. In discussing the role of banks and their activities in

chapter 6, we will see that two of the major risks that banks accept are

credit risk resulting from their lending activities and liquidity risk due to the

mismatch between borrowing short term and lending long term. These two

risks can result in difficulties for one major bank that can spill over to

another bank, causing a "run on banks." Avoiding such runs is one of the

motivations for bank deposit insurance and regulation of banks. This is not

the nature of the risks faced by insurers in their core business activities.

Hence the argument is that the insurance industry is not prone to systemic

risk.

Support for this view is provided in a report of the Group of Thirty, an

international body of leading experts in finance and economics, whose

mission is to study economic and financial issues facing the global

economy. [12] The authors of the study conclude that even under stress

conditions, with respect to insurance companies, it would be "unlikely to

cause widespread insolvencies in the primary insurance market and would

have only a limited effect on the financial system and the real economy

generally." [13] Harrington's study of the bailout of AIG by the federal

government concluded that the financial problems of that insurer were not

the result of the insurance products it sold but of its trading activities in a

financial derivative product and its securities lending program. [14]

Several studies have investigated whether insurers pose systemic risk.

None have found that to be the case. For example, investigating the issue of

whether U.S. insurers have the potential to cause systemic risk for the U.S.

economy, Cummins and Weiss looked at (1) the primary indicators that

determine whether insurers are systemically risky and (2) the contributing

factors that add to the vulnerability of the economy to systemic risk. [15]

Although the principal conclusion reached by the authors is that no

systemic risk is posed by U.S. insurers' core activities, the study did

identify potential concerns. They find that both life insurers and propertycasualty insurers are vulnerable to reinsurance crises and that life insurers

are vulnerable to intrasector crises. Noncore activities, such as financial

guarantees and derivatives trading, may cause systemic risk. Cummins and

Weiss conclude that to reduce systemic risk that might result from noncore

activities, efforts to strengthen mechanisms for insurance group supervision

must be continued.

```
Catastrophic Risk and Its Management

```

Insurers face extreme risks or catastrophic risk in their business, or what is

also referred to as "tail risk." The types of events and the resulting payout

by the insurer can threaten solvency. That is, the insurer may not have

sufficient capital to satisfy the claims of all policyholders. For P&C

insurers, catastrophic risk encompasses the potential damages associated

with natural disasters (hurricanes, windstorms, and earthquakes). In the case

- f life insurers, the catastrophic risks are extreme mortality risk or longevity
risk, depending on the life insurance product.

```
Extreme Mortality Risk and Longevity Risk

```

**Extreme mortality risk** is the risk of an extreme event leading to more
deaths than predicted from a mortality table. Extreme mortality events
include disease-related deaths, natural catastrophe–related deaths (e.g.,
earthquakes, floods), war-related deaths, or terrorism-related deaths. [16]
Because of their impact on the global population, disease-related events
appear to be the main extreme mortality event faced by life insurers. An
influenza pandemic is considered the most serious disease-related event.
Extreme mortality risk is a concern for pure life insurance products,
because death benefits must be paid out sooner than expected when the
insurer established the policy premium.

In contrast, **longevity risk** is the risk of policyholders living longer than

expected when the cost of the insurance (the premium) was established.

This occurs when mortality rates decrease. Longevity risk is the risk

associated with investment products, such as annuities. The longer a

policyholder lives, the greater the payout will be relative to what it was

expected to be when the premium was determined. Longevity risk is a

concern not only for annuity-type products offered by life insurers but also

for defined benefit plans.

```
Catastrophe Bonds and Insurance-Linked Securities

```

Although insurance companies are risk bearers, these institutional investors

have pursued strategies to share risks using reinsurance. Other catastrophic

risk management strategies involve structured finance technology, described

in chapter 27, to create **catastrophe bonds** (nicknamed "cat bonds") issued

by insurers that can provide them with a level of protection against

catastrophic risk that may not be available in the reinsurance market.

The securities created by life insurance companies and P&C insurance

companies to transfer catastrophic risk are called **insurance-linked**

**securities** . These securities, which are issued by insurers, provide a good

example of the convergence between the insurance industry and the

financial markets using structured finance technology. We do not cover

structured finance here. Instead, we just discuss one type of insurancelinked securities, catastrophe bonds. [17]

Cat bonds are issued by P&C insurers and reinsurers for the purpose of

transferring catastrophic risk. In some ways, they are structured like

standard bonds: they have a maturity value, a maturity date, and an interest

rate. They differ from a standard bond in that if losses of the insurer (i.e.,

the bond issuer) exceed a specified amount, the amount paid to the

bondholder at the maturity date is reduced. A formula specifies how much

less the maturity value will be based on the excess loss. The incentive for

investors to purchase cat bonds is that the interest rates they offer exceed

those of otherwise similar bonds with the same credit rating.

Cat bonds were first issued in 1996, triggered by two super catastrophes

in the United States: Hurricane Andrew (category 5), which struck South

Florida and Louisiana in 1992, causing an estimated \$26 billion in damage,

and the 1994 earthquake (magnitude 6.7) in Northridge, California, which

caused $15 to $20 billion in damage. For the first cat bond issue, the

interest rate was 400 basis points higher than that paid by otherwise

comparable bonds. That is, for the risk of losing some or part of the

principal at the maturity date, investors in the first cat bond received

compensation of 4% per year above what otherwise comparable bonds

- ffered.

Life insurers issue catastrophe mortality bonds that are structured such

that the payment depends on the change in a designated mortality index. For

that mortality index, there is a base mortality index set. If at the maturity

date the mortality index exceeds that base mortality index, then the

principal amount paid at issuance is a reduced amount that is determined by

a specified formula. The first catastrophe mortgage bond issued was in late

2003 by the reinsurer Swiss Reinsurance Group (Vita Capital Ltd.).

```
Insurance Company Investment Strategies

```

In general, the characteristics of insurance company investment portfolios

should reflect their liabilities, that is, the insurance products they

underwrite. There are many differences among the various types of

insurance policies. Among them are the following:

   - the expected time at which the average payment will be made by the
insurance company (technically, the "duration" of the payments); and

   - the statistical or actuarial accuracy of estimates of when the event
insured against will occur and the amount of the payment (that is, the

   - verall risk of the policy).

In addition, the taxes vary across different types of insurance policies and

companies.

The key distinction between life insurance and P&C insurance

companies lies in the difficulty of projecting whether a policyholder will be

paid off and how much the payment will be. Although this is no easy task

for either a life or a P&C insurance company, it is easier from an actuarial

perspective for a life insurance company. The amount and timing of claims

- n P&C insurance companies are more difficult to predict because of the
randomness of natural catastrophes and the unpredictability of court awards
in liability cases. This uncertainty about the timing and amount of cash

- utlays to satisfy claims has an impact on the investment strategies of the
funds of P&C insurance companies compared to life insurance companies.

Without investigating the details for the differences in the portfolios of

different types of insurance products, the major differences in the portfolios

- f life companies and P&C companies are as follows. Life companies on
average have less common stock, more private placements, more
commercial mortgages, fewer municipal bonds, and longer maturity bonds.

(These securities and financial assets are discussed in later chapters.) The

difference in municipal bond holdings is due to the tax-exempt

characteristic of these securities. The larger holdings of private placements

and commercial mortgages indicate the yield orientation of life companies.

This yield orientation is also consistent with the low holding of common

stock for life insurance companies.

```
Insurance Company Expansion into Other Financial Services

```

In many countries, the regulators of the insurance industry have given

increased latitude to insurers to sell noninsurance products or provide

financial services traditionally supplied by other financial institutions (such

as banks and investment banks). Here we describe three ways that insurance

companies have expanded into other financial services for individuals and

businesses.

```
Bank Insurance Model

```

As just explained, the distribution channels of insurance companies have

been changing. One of the major changes involves some sort of relationship

between a bank and an insurance company. Banks are averse to

manufacturing insurance products because of their inexperience and

regulatory issues; the risk borne by manufacturing insurance products; and

the long payback period of some insurance products. However, insurance

companies are attracted by the commercial bank customer base. As a result,

commercial bank distribution of insurance company products has grown

considerably. This bank insurance model is called "bancassurance."

The arrangements made between banks and insurance companies can be

(1) a strategic alliance arrangement, (2) a mixed arrangement, or (3) a full

integration model. With a **strategic alliance**, the relation involves solely the

bank marketing a company's insurance products. The **mixed arrangement**

calls for all marketing to be performed by the insurance company with the

bank's only duty being to provide leads from its customer base. The **full**

**integration arrangement** involves the bank using its own insurance brand

and providing customized solutions to its customers for their financial

needs. Banks would also require insurance regulatory approvals. The bank's

activities associated with the full integration arrangement are the marketing

- f insurance and servicing of claims.

Depending on the type of bank insurance arrangement, the benefits to

the bank are: [18]

   - The potential to reduce reliance on interest rate spreads (particularly
during low interest rate periods), increase income, and obtain a more
stable stream of income by diversifying into insurance.

   - Offer a wide range of financial services to current bank clients and
by doing so increase customer retention.

   - Improve integration of financial services provided to customers
tailored to their life cycle.

   - Capitalize on the bank's customer base.
   - Get access to funds that would otherwise be invested with life

insurers, who sometimes benefit from tax advantage.

From the perspective of an insurance company, the following are

potential benefits, depending on the type of arrangement:

   - Reduce reliance on the use of traditional agents to sell their products
by making use of the channels owned by the bank partner.

   - Obtain access to the bank partner's customer base.
   - Jointly develop new financial products with the bank partner and
market those products via the bank network rather than a network of

agents.

   - Share the cost of servicing policies with the bank partner.
   - Use the partner bank's capital to improve the insurer's solvency and
expand business.

From a regulatory perspective, the integration of banks and insurers is

challenging. The favorable impact is that the diversification offered by the

bank insurance model may lower systemic risk, because it potentially (1)

reduces the volatility of bank income and (2) provides insurers with access

to additional capital that improves solvency.

In the United States, the bank insurance model was permitted following

the repeal in 1999 of a restriction on banks to use this model (i.e., the GlassSteagall Act). In contrast, bancassurance has long been a practice in Europe

and by 2007 had made significant penetration in many European countries,

particularly France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. [19] In such developing

countries as Brazil and Malaysia, there has been significant use of

bancassurance. China had no restrictions on selling non-life policies but that

was not the case for life insurance. The Chinese government removed

several regulatory obstacles impeding the adoption of bancassurance in

```
Pension Funds and Insurance Companies

```

At one time, three distinct types of products were available for individuals:

insurance, savings/investment, and retirement. The specific products in each

distinguishable category were as follows. Insurance products included term

life and whole life. Savings/investment products included stocks, bonds,

and collective vehicles (such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds).

Private retirement products included defined benefit and defined

contribution plans (provided by employers and the subject of chapter 4),

and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) (provided by investment

companies).

Over the past three decades, many products have been developed that fit

into two or even three of these categories. Into which of these three

categories, for example, does an IRA sold to a customer by a life insurance

agent fit? Arguably, the correct answer to this question is all three

categories. Figure 8.1 provides a summary of some of the products on the

insurance/savings/retirement spectrum, which are really hybrids. We have

discussed the various insurance products in this chapter. Retirement

products are discussed in chapter 4. Mutual funds and other collective

investment products are discussed in chapter 32. This section discusses

products that are hybrid retirement and savings products but are often

manufactured and distributed by insurance companies.

Insurance/savings/retirement vehicles.

_Source:_ Frank J. Jones, "An Overview of Institutional Fixed Income Strategies," in _Professional_

_Perspectives on Fixed Income Portfolio Managemen_ t, volume 1 (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons,

2000).

In the United States, the products that are a hybrid of retirement and

investment products and are often distributed by insurance companies and

agents are 401(k)s, Roth 401(k)s, and variable annuities. These products are

also often distributed by many insurers, and the insurance companies often

include some of their own products in these categories. Because these plans

are retirement plans, they have tax advantages for the investor.

```
Insurance-Based Investment Banking

```

As will be explained throughout this book, many of the financial risks faced

by participants in the capital markets are being transferred from financial

institutions to the public market. We will see in later chapters how this

transfer has been done via the securitization mechanism. In the insurance

industry, debt instruments (such as bonds) have been created allowing

businesses and governments that need protection against the occurrence of

certain events to go directly to the capital market to obtain that protection

through the public issuance of securities rather than by purchasing

traditional insurance. That is, rather than an insurance company absorbing

the risk of some event, an entity that needs insurance protection can issue a

bond whose payoff at the bond's maturity date depends on whether an

adverse event occurs and the amount of the loss if it does. The

compensation to investors who purchase the bond is a higher interest rate

than on an otherwise comparable bond.

The area of finance in which publicly issued securities are used as a

substitute for traditional insurance policies is referred to as **insurance-**

**based investment banking** . Two examples help illustration how the public

markets (here the bond market) can be used to circumvent traditional

insurance.

For our first example, consider the operator of Tokyo Disneyland,

Oriental Land Company. In 1999, the company issued \$200 million of

bonds to insure against the risk of a Tokyo earthquake. We have already

discussed earlier cat bonds issued by a P&C insurer or reinsurers, which

were the first such bonds issued by a noninsurance company. There were

two issues of five-year bonds sold with a maturity value of \$100 million

each. For investors in the first bond issue, the entire principal and interest

would be lost if an earthquake occurred. The proceeds would then be used

by Oriental Land to repair damages to the park resulting from the

earthquake. Investors would pay off the holders of the second bond issue in

full, even if an earthquake occurred. However, the maturity of the bond

issue would increase from five years to 8.5 years if there were an

earthquake. This second bond issue basically provided Oriental Land with

emergency funding for 3.5 years should that entity have any difficulty

- btaining financing. Thus, not only were investors in the bond market
providing earthquake protection, they were also providing future financing
protection.

For our second example, consider the use of securities by the Fédération

Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to provide protection against

acts of terrorism that might have canceled the 2002 World Cup competition

in Asia. Because of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New

York City, on the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and in midair over

Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, insurance for events canceled as a

result of acts of terrorism was becoming difficult to obtain. The insurance

company that was supposed to provide cancellation insurance, AXA,

decided against providing the insurance because of the attacks on

September 11, 2001. Without the cancellation policy, the 2002 World Cup

could not take place. To resolve this problem, FIFA, working with the

investment banking firm Credit Suisse First Boston, created and then issued

in September a bond (referred to as a "cancellation bond") that would be

sold in the bond market, thereby transferring terrorism risk to investors in

the financial market. The amount of the bonds issued was \$260 million.

```
Key Points

```

- In general, insurance companies bear risk from parties who wish to avert
risk by transferring it to the insurance companies. The party seeking to
transfer the risk pays an insurance premium to the insurance company.
Insurance companies pay the insured if and when the insured event occurs.

   - The types of insurance include life insurance, health insurance,
property and casualty (P&C) insurance, liability insurance, umbrella
insurance, disability insurance, and long-term health care insurance.

   - An insurance company has three components: guarantor component,
investment component, and distribution component.

   - The revenue for insurers is derived from the premiums received and
from investment returns when premiums are invested until a claim is
paid out.

   - To reduce risk, a primary insurer can transfer some of its risk to a
reinsurance company.

   - If an insurance company decides to retain certain risks, it can selfinsure against these risks by establishing a captive insurance company
that it wholly owns.

   - Captive insurance companies are classified as single-parent captives,
association captives, industry captives, and diversified captives.

   - In the United States, an insurance company is structured either as a
stock company (which is similar in structure to any corporation or
public company) or as a mutual company (whose owners are the
policyholders rather than external investors).

   - Because of funding needs for growth, many mutual companies have
converted to stock companies, a process referred to as demutualization.

   - There are two fundamentally different types of life insurance: term
insurance (pure insurance protection) and cash value life insurance
(combined insurance protection and investment vehicle).

- Insurance companies increasingly offer products with a significant
investment component in addition to their insurance component:
guaranteed investment contracts and annuities.

- Insurance products are classified as general account and separate
account products.

- The general account of an insurance company refers to the
investment portfolio of the overall company, and products usually
carry a "general account guarantee" (i.e., are a liability of the
insurance company).

- Separate account products receive no guarantee from the insurer's
general account, and are guaranteed based on the performance of an
account that is separate from the general account of the insurance
company, often an account selected by the policyholder.

- Insurance regulation deals with solvency regulation and consumer
protection.

- The two principal reasons for the failure of an insurance company
are poor liquidity management and underpricing and underreserving.

- In the United States, insurance companies are regulated at the state
level, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiency in regulatory

- versight.
- The arguments for making the federal government the lead insurance
regulator are to eliminate any regulatory inconsistencies across states
and to allow better coordination with other federal agencies, such as
the Federal Reserve and the SEC.

- In the European Union, the Solvency II Directive has shifted focus
from compliance monitoring and capital to evaluating the risk profiles
and the quality of their risk management and governance systems.

- There has been considerable debate as to whether large insurers can
cause systemic risk events that adversely impact a country's financial
market and the global financial market.

- Valid arguments have been made that unlike large banks that are
categorized as global SIFIs, the core products of insurers are

sufficiently different from those of banks so that they should not be

classified as global SIFIs.

   - Several studies conclude that insurers do not pose systemic risk to
national or global financial markets, although the insurers' noncore
activities that may cause systemic risk.

   - Insurers of extreme or catastrophic risks night face solvencythreatening events.
   - Insurers have entered into other areas of finance: banking and
pension funds.

  - For P&C insurers, catastrophic risk encompasses the potential
damages associated with natural disasters (for example, hurricanes,
windstorms, and earthquakes). For life insurers, the catastrophic risks
are extreme mortality risk and longevity risk, depending on the life
insurance product.

   - In addition to reinsuring, insurers have created insurance-linked
securities to transfer risk through securitization from insurers to the
investing public. These bonds include catastrophe bonds and
catastrophe mortality bonds.

   - Insurance-based investment banking involves the creation of bonds
that can be used in lieu of traditional insurance by those seeking
insurance.

Being a mutual allows us to maintain our focus on serving our policyholders by delivering high

performing whole life insurance policies through the best-trained financial professionals in the

industry. Over the years we've made innovations in our products and investments in our people to

ensure that we'll continue to meet the long-term needs and requirements of our policyholders. We

believe this approach is in the best interests of both our clients and our company—today and for the

years ahead. [21]

12. What are term insurance, whole life insurance, variable life
insurance, and universal life insurance?

13. a. What is a guaranteed investment contract (GIC)?

b. Does a GIC carry a "guarantee" like that carried by a government

15. What is meant by an insurance company reinsuring its liabilities?
16. Whose liabilities are harder to predict, those of life and health
insurers or those of P&C insurers? Explain why.

17. In an article in _Forbes_, the following statement appeared,
contrasting the management of stock insurance companies and mutual
insurance companies:

With their survival on the line, publicly traded insurers are scrambling for cash by cutting dividends

and issuing new shares (diluting existing investors), begging regulators for a relaxation of capital

requirements and lobbying Washington for a cut of the \$700 billion Wall Street bailout. Their

mutually owned rivals haven't asked for a dime. Their statutory surpluses (the regulatory counterpart

to book value) have held steady or even increased. Some are announcing plans to pay out near-record

dividends to policyholders. [22]

What message is being conveyed in this statement, and how does it relate to

the principal-agent problem?

18. What type of strategies have insurers employed to deal with
catastrophic risk?

19. For what type of investment product are life insurers concerned
with longevity risk?

20. The following statement is from an article by Christopher Kampa
and Paul Siegert:

Insurance-linked securities, once considered to be an alternative form of risk transfer, have become a

mainstream method of transferring risk from insurers to the capital markets. With greater attention

being paid to risk at the institutional level and the search for portfolio diversification at the

investment level, insurance-linked securities seem poised to further facilitate the convergence

between the capital and insurance markets. [23]

Why do such products as insurance-linked securities represent the

convergence of capital markets and insurance markets?

Form and Insurance Company Performance: Stocks versus Mutuals," in _The Economics of Property-_
_Casualty Insurance_, ed. David F. Bradford (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), chap. 6,
168–192.

2. Most whole life insurance policies pay death benefits when one specified insured dies. An added
dimension of whole life policies insures two people (usually a married couple) jointly and pays the
death benefit not when the first person dies but when the second person (usually the surviving
spouse) dies. This type of policy is called "survivorship insurance" or "second-to-die insurance." The
survivorship feature can be added to standard cash value whole life, universal life, and variable
universal life policies. Thus, each of the four policies in table 8.2 could also be written on a
survivorship basis. Survivorship insurance is typically sold for estate planning purposes.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the nature of the investment banking business;
   - the revenue-generating activities of investment banks;
   - the activities of investment banking firms that require them to
commit their own capital;

   - the role investment bankers play in the underwriting of securities;
   - the different types of underwriting arrangements;
   - the difference between riskless arbitrage and risk arbitrage;
   - what proprietary trading is, and the Volcker Rule;
  - the various roles investment bankers play in mergers and
acquisitions;

   - what is meant by merchant banking; and
  - why investment banking firms create and trade risk control
instruments.

Investment banking firms play a key role in capital markets by performing

two general functions. For corporations, U.S. government agencies, state

and local governments, and foreign entities (sovereigns and corporations)

that need funds, investment banking firms assist in obtaining those funds.

For investors who wish to invest funds, investment banking firms act as

brokers or dealers in the buying and selling of securities. Thus, investment

banking firms perform a critical role in the primary market and the

secondary market that we describe in chapters 17 and 18.

Investment banking firms are highly leveraged companies, that is, the

amount of borrowed funds relative to the amount of equity is high. The

activities in which they are engaged dictate that this be the case.

Historically, the increasing need for capital resulted in the consolidation of

firms in the industry and a change in many firms from a partnership

structure to a corporate structure, which gives firms easier access to public

funds. Investment banking firms generate revenue from commissions, fee

income, spread income, and principal activities. Specifically, these activities

can be classified as follows:

public offering of securities,

private placement of securities,

securitization of assets,

mergers and acquisitions,

merchant banking,

advising on financial restructuring,

trading of securities,

prime brokerage,

trading and creation of derivative instruments, and

asset management.

In this chapter, we describe each of these activities performed by

investment banking firms, but before doing so, we describe the way

investment banks are classified.

```
Investment Banking Industry

```

In the United States, prior to 1999, federal legislation in the form of the

Glass-Steagall Act separated the activities of commercial banks, investment

banks, and insurance companies. The Glass-Steagall Act restricted the types

- f securities that commercial banks in the United States could underwrite—

an important investment banking activity, as explained in this chapter. This

act had regulated the industry since the Great Depression. The GrammLeach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 supplanted the

Glass-Steagall Act and eliminated the restrictions on the activities

conducted by companies in each financial sector. Now commercial banks as

well as insurance companies can underwrite securities.

As a result, the firms that are involved in the activities of investment

banking fall into two categories. The first category comprises investment

banks that are affiliated with large financial services holding companies.

Most such firms are affiliated with large commercial bank holding

companies, which the Federal Reserve, the regulator of bank holding

companies, refers to as "nonbanking investments." [1] Examples of

commercial bank holding companies that have an investment banking

affiliate are Bank of America, Barclays Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse,

Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and UBS. These

investment banks are referred to as **bank-affiliated investment banks** . In

the second category are investment banking firms that are independent of a

large financial services holding company and for that reason are referred to

as

**independent investment banks** . Examples are the Blackstone Group,

Greenhill & Company, Houlihan Lokey, Raymond James, and Morgan

Keegan.

Investment banking firms are also classified according to the investment

banking activities they perform into full-service investment banks and

boutique investment banks. **Full-service investment banks** are basically

involved in the wide range of activities described in this chapter. The bankaffiliated investment banks fall into this category. The larger full-service

investment banking firms—which are viewed as the premier investment

banking firms because of their size, reputation, presence in key markets,

and customer base—are referred to as "bulge-bracket" firms. **Boutique**

**investment banks** specialize in limited areas of investment banking.

Since the financial crisis of 2008, the market share of U.S. investment

banks has been dominated by U.S. firms, and the market share of European

investment banks has declined. [2] According to several commentaries, small,

medium, and large European countries would find European-based global

investment banking firms difficult to support and, should there be financial

difficulties faced by such firms, it would cause major problems for any

European country. [3] The expectation is that in the near future, it is likely that

European-based global investment banks' role will continue to decline.

Since 2015, the market share of Chinese investment banks in the AsiaPacific region has surpassed the market share of both U.S. and European

investment banks.

Goodhart and Schoenmaker believe that with the declining role of a

European-based global investment banks, the result will be a four-tier

investment banking system with the first tier being the U.S.-based bulgebracket firms. [4] Strong regional investment banks throughout the world will

be in the second tier. In Europe, these firms would include Barclays Bank

and NM Rothschild in the United Kingdom and Deutsche Bank in

Germany. In the Asia-Pacific region, they would include CITIC in China.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC), the largest bank in Hong

Kong, has roots in both the European and Asia-Pacific regions. The third

tier, according to Goodhart and Schoenmaker, consists of bank-affiliated

investment banking firms that support corporations and governments but

are not involved in global investment banking activities. Examples would

be Australian and Canadian banks. Finally, boutique firms that specialize in

advisory and wealth management activities described later in this chapter

represent the fourth tier.

```
Public Offering of Securities

```

The traditional role associated with investment banking is the underwriting

- f securities. In the United States, the traditional process for issuing new
securities involves investment bankers performing one or more of the
following three functions:

advising the issuer on the terms and the timing of the offering,

buying the securities from the issuer, and

distributing the issue to the public.

The adviser role may require investment bankers to design a security

structure that is more palatable to investors than a particular traditional

instrument. Seeking to reduce the cost of borrowing for their clients,

investment bankers have designed innovative security structures with

characteristics that are more attractive to investors while not being onerous

to issuers. We will give several examples of these financial innovations in

later chapters.

When selling new securities, investment bankers need not undertake the

second function of buying the securities from the issuer. An investment

banker can merely act as an adviser or distributor of the new security. The

.

function of buying the securities from the issuer is called **underwriting**

When an investment banking firm buys the securities from the issuer and

accepts the risk of selling the securities to investors at a lower price, the

firm is referred to as an **underwriter** . When the investment banking firm

agrees to buy the securities from the issuer at a set price, the underwriting

arrangement is referred to as a **firm commitment** . The risk that the

investment banking firm accepts in a firm-commitment underwriting

arrangement is that the price it pays to purchase the securities from the

issuer may be less than the price it receives when it reoffers the securities to

the public. In contrast, in a **best-efforts underwriting arrangement**, the

investment banking firm agrees only to use its expertise to sell the

securities; it does not buy the entire issue from the issuer.

The fee earned from underwriting a security is the difference between

the price paid to the issuer and the price at which the investment bank then

- ffers the security to the public. This difference is referred to as the **gross**
**spread**, or the **underwriter discount** . Numerous factors affect the size of
the gross spread. Two important factors are the size of the offering and the
type of security. Generally, the larger the offering size is, the smaller the
gross spread will be. In general, the gross spread on bonds is less than for
common stock.

A new common stock offering is classified as an initial public offering

- r a secondary common stock offering. An **initial public offering** (IPO) is
a common stock offering issued by companies that have not previously
issued common stock to the public. A study Ritter on IPOs from 1999 to
2013 found that, with few exceptions, gross spreads for moderate-sized
IPOs were about 7%, but megadeals had gross spreads of far less than 7%: [5]
Facebook, for example, had a 1.1% gross spread on a \$16 billion IPO in
2012, Twitter had a 3.25% gross spread on a \$10 billion IPO in 2013,
General Motors had a gross spread of 0.75% on a \$15.8 billion IPO in 2010,
and Visa had a gross spread of 2.8% on a \$17.9 billion IPO in 2008.

A **secondary common stock offering** is an offering of common stock

that had been issued in the past by the corporation. The range for the gross

spread as a percentage of the amount raised is 3% to 6%. Because of the

risk associated with pricing and then selling an IPO to investors, the gross

spread is higher than for a secondary common stock offering. For traditional

bond offerings, the gross spread as a percentage of the principal is around

50 basis points. This smaller gross spread compared to that for common

stock offerings reflects the lower risk associated with such underwritings.

The typical underwritten transaction involves so much risk of capital

loss that for a single investment banking firm to undertake it alone would

expose it to the danger of losing a significant portion of its capital. To share

this risk, an investment banking firm puts together a group of firms to

underwrite the issue. This group of firms is known as an **underwriting**

**syndicate** . The gross spread is then divided among the lead underwriter(s)

and the other firms in the underwriting syndicate. The lead underwriter

manages the deal ("runs the books" for the deal). In many cases, more than

- ne firm may act as lead underwriter, in which case the lead underwriters
are said to "co-lead" or "co-manage" the deal. In a bond transaction, the
lead underwriters customarily receive 20% of the gross spread as
compensation for managing the deal.

To realize the gross spread, the entire securities issue must be sold to the

public at the planned reoffering price, which usually requires a great deal of

marketing muscle. Investment banking firms attempt to sell the securities to

their investor client base (retail and institutional). To increase the potential

investor base, the lead underwriter puts together a **selling group** . This

group includes the underwriting syndicate plus other firms not in the

syndicate. Members of the selling group can buy the security at a

concession price (a price less than the reoffering price). The gross spread is

thereby divided among the lead underwriter, members of the underwriting

syndicate, and members of the selling group.

The underwriting of securities is not limited to offerings in the United

States. An issuer can select among many foreign securities markets to

identify the one in which to offer securities and so reduce its cost of funds.

Indeed, some securities are offered simultaneously in several markets

throughout the world.

Investment bankers also may assist in offering the securities of

government-owned companies to private investors. This process is referred

to as **privatization** . An example is the IPO of the U.S. government–owned

railroad company Conrail in March 1987. More than 58 million shares were

sold, raising a total of \$1.65 billion. It was the largest IPO in the history of

the United States. Other examples from outside the United States are the

United Kingdom's British Telecom, Chile's Pacifica, and France's Paribas.

In the case of British Telecom (the government-owned telephone company

- f the United Kingdom), the amount raised was \$4.7 billion. This global
- ffering was offered simultaneously in several countries. In the 1990s,
investment bankers increased their role in placing the securities of

government-owned companies into the hands of private investors. Eastern

Europe, for example, followed a major program of privatization.

In the industry, investment banking firms that underwrite securities in

the different areas are ranked by some measure of market share, referred to

as the "league tables." Investment bankers view this rating as a key

indicator of their importance in a market sector. Market share can be

measured by the number of deals done in a year or by the total dollar

volume of all deals done in a year. [6]

```
Private Placement of Securities

```

In addition to underwriting securities for distribution to the public,

investment banking firms place securities with a limited number of

institutional investors, such as insurance companies, investment companies,

and pension funds.

Investment banking firms assist in the private placement of securities in

several ways. They work with the issuer and potential investors on the

design and pricing of the security. Investment bankers first design many of

the new security structures in the private placement market. Field testing of

the innovative securities described in this book most often occurs in the

private placement market. For example, zero-coupon corporate bonds were

first publicly issued by corporations in April 1981, and the first issue was

by J. C. Penney. Prior to that time, a private offering was made by PepsiCo.

An investment banker may be involved with lining up investors as well

as designing the issue. Or, if the issuer has already identified the investors,

the investment banker may serve only in an advisory capacity. Work as an

adviser generates fee income, as does arranging the placement with

investors. An investment banker may also participate in the transaction

through a best-efforts underwriting arrangement.

The fees for arranging a private placement vary, depending on the

issuance amount and the complexity of the transaction. Moreover, when

raising venture capital for clients, investment bankers are frequently offered

the opportunity to share in the prosperity of the company. This opportunity

typically comes in the form of an option to buy a specified number of

shares at a price set at the time the funds are raised. An arrangement that

allows the investment banking firm to benefit from the company's success

is referred to as an "equity kicker."

```
Securitization of Assets

```

The "securitization of assets" refers to the issuance of securities using a

pool of assets as collateral. The securitization of home mortgage loans to

create mortgage-backed securities was the first example of this process.

After 1985, investment bankers worked with corporations to either

securitize a wide range of loans and receivables or to buy loans and

receivables in the market and issue securities backed by them.

Securities backed by a pool of loans or receivables are called **asset-**

**backed securities** and are discussed in chapter 27. When an investment

banker works with a corporation to issue an asset-backed security, the sale

- f the security generates revenue from the bid-ask spread. When an
investment banker buys loans and receivables and then issues securities, a
profit is generated on an asset-backed security transaction, derived as
follows: the price that the security is sold for minus the price that the
investment banker paid to purchase the collateral (i.e., the cost of buying
the loans and receivables) minus the interest cost of "warehousing" the
collateral purchased until the securities are sold.

```
Mergers and Acquisitions

```

Investment banking firms are active in mergers and acquisitions (M&As).

Also included under M&A activities are leveraged buyouts (LBOs),

restructuring and recapitalization of companies, and reorganization of

bankrupt and troubled companies.

Investment bankers participate in M&A activity in one of several ways:

(1) by finding M&A candidates; (2) by advising acquiring companies or

target companies with respect to price and nonprice terms of an exchange,

- r by helping target companies fend off an unfriendly takeover attempt; and
(3) by assisting acquiring companies in obtaining the necessary funds to
finance a purchase.

The fees charged by investment bankers in M&A work depend on the

extent of their participation and the complexity of the activities they are

asked to perform. An investment banker may simply receive an advisory

fee or retainer. More likely, an investment banker will receive a fee based

- n a percentage of the selling price. The fee structure in this case may be
- ne of three types: (1) the percentage may decline with increasing selling
price; (2) the percentage may be the same regardless of the selling price; or
(3) the percentage may be fixed, with addition of an incentive fee if the
price is better than a specified amount. An example of the first fee structure
is what is called the 5–4–3–2–1 "Lehman formula." In this fee structure,
which some firms have adopted, the fee is set at 5% of the first \$1 million,
4% of the second \$1 million, 3% of the third \$1 million, 2% of the fourth
\$1 million, and 1% for any excess amount. A typical flat percentage is 2%
to 3% of the selling price.

Participating in an LBO can generate several fees. LBOs call for a firm

to be acquired using mostly debt funds and taken private. The debt raised is

from one of two sources: senior bank debt and unsecured junior debt (called

subordinated debt, or mezzanine financing). An investment banking firm

can earn fees from (1) proposing the acquisition, (2) arranging the

financing, (3) arranging bridge financing (i.e., temporary funds lent until

permanent debt financing is completed), and (4) other advisory fees.

An investment banking firm may provide its own capital for bridge

financing. This type of merchant banking is discussed in the next section.

Under "other advisory fees" are the fees charged by investment banking

firms for providing a valuation of a firm that is the subject of a takeover or

a merger, and for rendering a "fairness opinion." The question of fairness

arises in such a transaction based on the issue of whether the purchasers of

the company might have had access to information that allowed them to

acquire the firm at a price less than its true market value. This situation is of

increasing concern in LBOs, particularly management-led LBOs (that is,

where the current management of the firm makes an offer to purchase the

company). An investment banking firm is typically engaged by the board of

directors of the company that is the subject of the takeover to render an

independent and expert opinion as to the fairness of the price being offered

for the shares. The need for a fairness opinion, as well as advising, has

increased as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The board of directors will

want to have a third party review some of its major business transactions

before it approves them. Fees for a fairness opinion range from \$50,000 for

a transaction involving a few million dollars to \$1 million or more for large

transactions.

```
Merchant Banking

```

When an investment banking firm commits its own funds by taking either

an equity interest or a creditor position in companies, this activity is

referred to as **merchant banking** . Investment banking firms have divisions

- r groups that undertake merchant banking through a series of private
equity funds. As described by one boutique investment banking firm, Noble
Capital Markets, merchant banking activities include:

Targeting domestic companies within our areas of focus and expertise

Analyzing a company's opportunities and assessing its risks within their respective industry

Structuring, negotiating and executing the transaction

Work in assessing the appropriate time and manner in which to harvest the investment. [7]

The work of the merchant banking team does not stop after the

transaction. As noted by Noble Capital Markets, the firm assists the

"management team and Board of Directors to create value and grow their

businesses to facilitate long-term shareholder value."

```
Advising on Financial Restructuring

```

**Financial restructuring** involves a significant modification of a
corporation's capital structure, operating structure, or corporate strategy
with the objective of improving efficiency. Financial restructuring may be
undertaken to (1) avoid bankruptcy or problems with creditors or (2)
reorganize the firm under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. [8]
Investment bankers advise corporations on financial restructuring in order
to generate fee income.

Here are two examples of financial restructuring situations advised by

the boutique investment banking firm Greenhill & Co. as reported on the

firm's website. In 2011, the firm advised a natural gas–fired power plant

located in Texas, Bosque Power Company, on its negotiations with lenders

and restructuring. In the same year, the firm advised a U.K. listed

multichannel retailer, Findel plc, on the "restructuring of its balance sheet

comprising an equity capital raising and refinancing of its debt and pension

- bligations." [9]

```
Trading of Securities

```

A successful underwriting of a security requires a strong sales force. The

sales force provides feedback on advance interest in the deal, and the

traders (or market makers) provide input into pricing the deal as well. It

would be a mistake to think that once all the securities are sold, the

investment banking firm's ties with the deal are ended. In the case of bonds,

those who bought the securities will look to the investment banking firm to

make a market in the issue. Therefore, the investment banking firm must be

willing to take a principal position in secondary market transactions.

Revenue from this activity is generated through (1) the difference between

the price at which the investment banking firm sells the security and the

price paid for the securities (called the "bid-ask spread") and (2)

appreciation of the price of the securities held in inventory. Obviously, if the

securities depreciate in price, revenue will also be reduced.

To protect against a loss, investment banks engage in hedging strategies.

The various strategies employed by traders to generate revenue from

positions in one or more securities include riskless arbitrage, risk arbitrage,

and speculation. Below we discuss the first two strategies.

```
Riskless Arbitrage

```

In the finance industry, the term "arbitrage" is used to refer to two types of

transactions: riskless arbitrage and risk arbitrage. The first type of arbitrage

transactions, **riskless arbitrage**, calls for a trader to find a security or

package of securities trading at different prices. For example, some

common stocks of companies trade in more than one location in the United

States. Also, the common stock of some multinational companies trades in

both the United States and on an exchange in one or more foreign countries.

If price discrepancies occur in the various markets, it may be possible to

lock in a profit after transaction costs by selling the security in a market

where it is priced higher and buying it in a market where it is priced lower.

In the case of a security priced in a foreign currency, the price must be

converted based on the exchange rate.

Traders do not expect such situations to occur, because they are rare.

Although they do occur periodically in financial markets, riskless arbitrage

- pportunities of the type described are short lived. In some situations,
however, packages of securities and derivative contracts, combined with
borrowing, can produce a payoff identical to that of another security, even
though the two are priced differently. The key point is that a riskless
arbitrage transaction does not expose the investor to any adverse movement
in the market price of the securities in the transaction.

Because the concept of riskless arbitrage provides the underlying

process by which assets are priced, we will provide an example. The

following table shows three securities, A, B, and C, that can be purchased

today; one year from today, we assume they can experience only two

possible outcomes, state 1 and state 2:

Security Price ($) Payoff in State 1 ($) Payoff in State 2 ($)

X 35 25 40

Y 30 15 60

Z 40 19 66

In this example, we use the following notation. Let _W_ A and _W_ B be the

quantity of security A and B, respectively, in the portfolio. Then the payoff

(i.e., the terminal value of the portfolio) under the two states can be

expressed mathematically as follows:

Payoff if state 1 occurs: $50 _W_ A + $30 _W_ B;

Payoff if state 2 occurs: $100 _W_ A + $120 _W_ B.

Can we create a portfolio consisting of A and B that will reproduce the

payoff of C regardless of the state that occurs one year from now? That is,

we want to select _W_ A and _W_ B such that:

If state 1 occurs: $50 _W_ A + $30 _W_ B = \$38;

If state 2 occurs: $100 _W_ A + $120 _W_ B = \$112.

The dollar payoff on the right-hand side of the two equations is the payoff

- f C in each state.

We can solve these two equations algebraically, obtaining a value of 0.4

for _W_ A and 0.6 for _W_ B. Thus, a portfolio consisting of 0.4 of security A and

0.6 of security B will have the same payoff as security C. How much will it

cost us to construct this portfolio? As the prices of A and B are \$70 and

\$60, respectively, the cost is

0.40($70) + 0.60($60) = \$64.

Note that the price of C is \$80.Thus, for only \$64, an investor can obtain

the same payoff as C. This riskless arbitrage opportunity can be exploited

by buying A and B in the proportions given above and shorting (selling) C.

(Short selling is discussed in chapter 23.) This action allows the investor to

lock in a profit of \$16 today regardless of what happens one year from now.

By selling C, the investor must pay \$38 if state 1 occurs and \$112 if state 2

- ccurs. The investor will obtain the amounts necessary to make the
payments in either state that occurs from the payoff resulting from A or B.

```
Risk Arbitrage

```

Certain trading strategies are believed to carry a low level of risk. Because

- f the risk exposure, such trading strategies are unfortunately labeled **risk**
**arbitrage** . Of the two types of risk arbitrage, the first arises in the case of
exchange offers for securities of corporations coming out of a bankruptcy
proceeding. For example, suppose that company A is being reorganized,
and one of its bonds is now selling in the market for \$200. If the trader
believes that the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings will be the
exchange of three securities with an estimated value of \$280 for the existing
bond worth \$200, then the trader will buy the existing bond. The trader will
realize a profit of \$80 if in fact the final exchange offer is as anticipated,
and the value of the package is worth \$280.

The spread between the \$280 potential package and the \$200 price for

the bond reflects two risks: the risk that the exchange will not take place on

the terms that the trader believes, and the risk that the value of the package

- f three securities that will be received will be less than \$200. The "risk" in

this risk arbitrage transaction reflects these two risks.

The other type of risk arbitrage occurs when a merger or acquisition is

announced, referred to as **merger arbitrage** . The merger or acquisition can

involve a cash exchange, an exchange of securities, or a combination of

both. We'll first consider a cash exchange. Suppose that company X

announces that it plans to make an offer to buy company Y's common stock

for \$100 per share at a time when company Y’s common stock is selling for

\$70. One would expect that the market price of Y's common stock would

rise to about \$100.The risk, however, is that company X will, for whatever

reason, withdraw its planned purchase of the stock. The price of company

Y’s common stock consequently may rise to, say, \$90 rather than \$100. The

\$10 difference is the market's assessment of the likelihood of the planned

purchase not being completed. An investor who buys the common stock of

Y can lock in a profit of \$10 if the purchase occurs at \$100.The risk is that

it will not occur and that the price will decline below \$90.

The various attempts of UAL Corporation (the parent company of

United Airlines) provide a classic example of the risk associated with this

type of risk arbitrage. In September 1989, a group consisting of pilots and

management made a \$300 per share bid for UAL’s stock. Even though the

board of UAL approved the offer, the bidders could not obtain the necessary

financing to complete the transaction. During this time, the stock reached a

peak of \$296 per share. In mid-October, when the bidding group

acknowledged that the transaction would not take place, the stock fell by

almost 50% in a matter of a few days. In January 1990, another bid for

UAL Corporation for \$201 per share was made by the union. Once again,

the financing for the takeover could not be obtained, resulting in a plunge in

the market price. Industry experts estimated these failed takeover attempts

resulted in losses to risk arbitrageurs of more than \$1 billion.

When a transaction involves the exchange of securities rather than cash,

the announced terms of the exchange will not be reflected immediately in

the price of the securities involved. For example, suppose that company B

announces that it plans to acquire company T. Company B is called the

"bidding" or "acquiring" firm, and company T is the target firm. Company

B announces that it intends to offer one share of its stock in exchange for

- ne share of company T stock. At the time of the announcement, suppose
that the prices of the stock of B and T are \$50 and \$42, respectively. If the
acquisition does take place as announced, a trader who acquires one share

- f company T for \$42 can exchange it for stock worth \$50, a spread of \$8.
This spread reflects three risks: (1) the acquisition may not be consummated
for one reason or another, and then T's stock may have to be sold, possibly
at a loss; (2) the time delay means a cost is involved in financing the
position in T's stock; and (3) the price of company B's stock can decline in
value so that when T's stock is exchanged for B's, less of a spread is
realized.

The way to protect against this last risk is for the trader to buy shares of

T and sell short an equal number of shares of B (recall that the transaction is

a one-for-one share exchange) so as to lock in a spread of \$8 if the

transaction is consummated. Let's look at what happens now if the price of

company B's stock changes at the time the transaction is consummated. At

that time, the price of the stock of company B and company T will be the

same.

Suppose the price of company B's stock falls from $50 to $45. Then,

when the trader exchanges one share of stock T for stock B, there will be a

profit of \$3 at the purchase price of \$42 for stock T. The short sale of one

share of stock B for \$50 can now be covered by buying it back for \$45,

realizing a profit of \$5. The trader’s overall profit will be \$8, the spread that

the trader wanted to lock in.

Suppose instead that at the time the exchange is consummated, one share

- f stock B is worth \$60 per share. By exchanging stock T, which was
purchased at \$42, for one share of stock B, which is now worth \$60, a
trader can realize a profit of \$18 on this leg of the transaction. However,
because stock B was sold short for \$50 and must now be purchased for \$60
to cover the short position, a loss of \$10 is realized on the second leg of the
transaction. Overall, a profit of \$8 is still realized. Thus, risk arbitrage to
lock in a spread, if the _exchange is consummated on the announced terms_,
involves buying the shares of the target company and shorting the shares of
the acquiring or bidding company. The number of shares depends on the

exchange terms. Our example assumes a one-for-one exchange, so one

share of company B was shorted for every share of company T purchased.

Had the exchange been one share of company B for every two shares of

company T, then one share of company B would have been shorted for

every two shares of company T purchased.

The first risk remains: the risk that the deal will not be consummated. To

reduce this risk, the trader or research department must carefully examine

the likelihood of a successful takeover or merger.

```
Proprietary Trading

```

**Proprietary trading**, or "prop" trading, occurs when the trader positions
the capital of the investment banking firm to take advantage of a specific
anticipated movement of prices or a spread between two prices. The
benefits of being right, particularly with a highly leveraged position, are
rewarding. We read in the popular press that some investment banking firms
have reaped millions of dollars from some specific speculative position; it
should be remembered, however, that just as often we read about large
trading losses from speculative strategies.

Here are just a few notable examples of major financial debacles from

prop trading:

  - In April and May 2012, JPMorgan Chase lost approximately \$6
billion from trades on complex derivatives in its London office. [10]

   - The now bankrupt Lehman Brothers lost \$32 billion in 2008 from
prop trading and other transactions when the bank acted as a principal.
The company’s common equity at the time was only \$18 billion.

   - Merrill Lynch and Citigroup lost \$20 and \$15 billion, respectively, in
structured products known as collateralized debt obligations (see
chapter 39).

   - In the fourth quarter of 2007, Morgan Stanley lost \$4 billion in prop
trading.

  - In February 1995, a derivatives trader for Barings Bank, Nick
Leeson, speculated in Nikkei 225 stock index futures and Japanese
government bonds, resulting in losses so great that it brought down the

bank. Although the trades were unauthorized, it highlights that

proprietary trading must be accompanied by risk control systems.

Economists, regulators, and market participants have argued that prop

trading at bank-affiliated investment banks was a leading cause of the

global financial crisis that began in 2007. Because of the financial debacle

arising from prop trading by bank-affiliated investment banks, the Obama

Administration proposed, as part of regulatory reform, prohibiting financial

institutions that benefit from government support (such as the insuring of

deposits by the federal government) from engaging in certain activities that

would place the bank's capital at risk. One such activity is prop trading.

This prohibition or limitation of prop trading by banks is popularly referred

to as the **Volcker Rule**, so named after the adviser to President Obama and

former Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker, who proposed it.

Subsequent to the proposal in 2011 of the Volcker Rule, debates

followed as to its merits. One of the major concerns with implementing the

Volcker Rule is drawing the line between prop trading and market making.

That is, it may be difficult to define prop trading in some instances because

- f the similarity of that activity to the normal market-making activity of
bank-affiliated investment banks. In his letter to the Fed, Volcker also
warned regulators to be careful when defining market making. He said that
holding "substantial securities in a trading book for an extended period

- bviously assumes the character of a proprietary position, particularly if not
specifically hedged," [11] and that is what the Volcker Rule tries to prevent.

Banks opposed any such restrictions, because historically, a significant

share of their profits was generated from prop trading, as well as from other

activities involving principal transactions. However, among the major

supporters of the Volcker Rule were some who had formerly held key

positions in the financial industry. For example, in a comment letter to the

SEC, John Reed, the CEO of Citigroup from 1984 to 2000, described the

rule as a "critical response" to prop trading, and went even further to state

that the penalties for its violations were not severe enough. He noted,

"When a firm is focused on market gain, it will employ every available

device to achieve those gains—including taking advantage of clients and

putting the firm at risk." It is interesting to note in that in the 1990s, Mr.

Reed was a key driver in passing legislation for the separation of

commercial and investment banking (the Glass-Steagall Act).

In a _Wall Street Journal_ editorial, Roger Vasey, who managed the global

debt markets group at Merrill Lynch, disputed the claims of opponents of

the Volcker Rule that it would impair the ability of the banks to generate

profits. [12] He argued that based on his experience, banks could be successful

without proprietary trading, noting that this was the case before Merrill

Lynch became a bank-affiliated investment bank. After the repeal of the

Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, banks that did have government-guaranteed

deposits took on riskier positions.

In addition to officials of investment banking firms who attacked the

Volcker Rule, others expressed concern regarding the rule's impact on

market-making activities. A January 16, 2012, comment letter to the SEC

by Darrell Duffie of Stanford University focused on the adverse impact on

market making that would be an unintended consequence of the Volcker

Rule:

[The] proposed implementation of the Volcker Rule would reduce the quality and capacity of marketmaking services that banks provide to U.S. investors. Investors and issuers of securities would find it

more costly to borrow, raise capital, invest, hedge risks, and obtain liquidity for their existing

positions. Eventually, non-bank providers of market-making services would fill some or all of the lost

market-making capacity, but with an unpredictable and potentially adverse impact on the safety and

soundness of the financial system.

The letter goes on to identify and then explain the two major unintended

consequences of the proposed Volcker Rule:

1. Over the years during which the financial industry adjusts to the
Volcker Rule, investors would experience higher market execution
costs and delays. Prices would be more volatile in the face of supply
and demand shocks. This loss of market liquidity would also entail a
loss of price discovery and higher costs of financing for homeowners,
municipalities, and businesses.

2. The financial industry would eventually adjust through a significant
migration of market making to the outside of the regulated bank sector.
This would have unpredictable and potentially important adverse
consequences for financial stability.

Other important players in the financial market expressed concern about

the Volcker Rule's impact on market making in non-U.S. government

bonds. The Volcker Rule did exempt U.S. government bonds, but not the

bonds of other countries. In an interview on Bloomberg Television on

January 30, 2012, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada (the

central bank of Canada), expressed concern about how the failure to clearly

distinguish between prop trading and market making could have an adverse

impact on the market for foreign government bonds. Governor Carney, an

important financial policymaker, pointed out that because the Volcker Rule

did not exempt the government bonds of other countries, a market in which

U.S.-based banks played a key role, "there is a potential for real liquidity

change." [13] The same concern was expressed in a Bloomberg interview on

January 25, 2012, with respect to Canada's federal and provincial

government bonds, by Ontario's finance minister Dwight Duncan.

Objections were also raised by the Japanese central bank that the cost of

trading its country bonds would increase as a result of the Volcker Rule.

The internal commissioner of the European Union, Mark Barrier, also

expressed similar concern to the U.S. Treasury.

After two years of debate and fine-tuning of the Volcker Rule, initially

proposed in November 2011, the final rule was approved in December 2013

with an effective implementation date of April 2014. In general, the Volcker

Rule as adopted prohibits a banking entity from (1) engaging in short-term

proprietary trading and (2) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or

sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund. A banking entity is defined

as an insured depository institution and companies affiliated with insured

depository institutions. The Volcker Rule does expressly permit certain

trading activity, such as underwriting activities, market-making-related

activities, risk-mitigating hedging activities, trading in government

- bligations, undertaking insurance company activities, and organizing and
- ffering hedge funds or private equity funds. However, larger banks and
bank affiliates (size being based on the amount of total assets) that conduct
proprietary trading of the sort permitted by the Volcker Rule are subject to
compliance reporting to ensure they are conforming to the rule.

As a result of the Volcker Rule, l bank-affiliated investment banks have

closed down their prop trading desks, and some have spun off their prop

trading desks as independent ventures (specifically, hedge funds, which are

described in chapter 32). For example, Credit Suisse spun off its internal

hedge fund (an entity that did prop trading) to create the entity Credit Value

Partners. UBS created an Australian-based hedge fund, MST Capital, which

does proprietary trading.

```
Execution of Trades for Clients

```

Commissions are generated by executing trades for investors, both retail

and institutional investors. Two common institutional trades that investment

bankers are called on to execute are block trades and program (or basket)

trades. These trades are discussed in chapter 23.

```
Prime Brokerage

```

An investment banking firm can provide a package of services to hedge

fund and large institutional investors. This package of services, referred to

as prime brokerage, includes securities finance (i.e., securities lending and

the financing of securities), global custody, operational support, and risk

management systems. Prime brokerage is a fee-driven service, except in the

case of securities finance, where interest income is earned.

With respect to securities lending, in the secondary market for securities

and the various trading strategies employed by institutional investors,

market participants may have to borrow funds to purchase securities or to

borrow securities. Because some investors need to borrow securities, other

investors who own securities may be willing to lend them. Institutional

investors usually look to an investment banking firm that is operating in the

secondary market to provide these services. Investment banking firms

generate fee income and interest income for their participation in these

activities.

```
Trading and Creation of Derivative Instruments

```

Futures, options, swaps, caps, and floors are examples of instruments that

can be used to control the risk of an investor's portfolio, or, in the case of an

issuer, the risk associated with the issuance of a security. These instruments

are referred to as **derivative instruments** and allow an investment banking

firm to realize revenue in several ways. First, customers generate

commissions from the exchange-traded instruments they buy and sell. This

process is no different from the commissions generated by the brokerage

service performed for customers when stocks are bought and sold.

Second, certain derivative instruments are created by an investment

banking firm for its clients when it acts as a counterparty to the agreement.

These products are called **over-the-counter instruments** - r **dealer-created**

**derivative instruments** . An example is a swap, which we describe in

chapter 37. The risk of loss of capital is present when an investment

banking firm is a counterparty, because the investment banker becomes a

principal to the transaction. To protect against capital loss, an investment

banking firm will seek another party to take the other side of the

transaction. When this occurs, spread income is generated.

Derivative instruments are also used to protect an investment bank's

- wn position in transactions. Here are just two examples. Suppose an
investment banking firm underwrites a bond issue. The risk that the firm is
exposed to is a decline in the price of the bonds purchased from the issuer,
which are to be reoffered to the public. Using either interest rate futures or

- ptions (the subject of chapters 34 and 37), the investment banking firm can
protect itself. As a second example, an investment banking firm has many
trading desks with either long or short positions in a security. Derivative
instruments can be used by the trading desks to protect the firm against an
adverse price movement.

```
Asset Management

```

Full-service investment banks have divisions that manage assets for various

clients, such as insurance companies, endowments, foundations, corporate

and public pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals. These asset

management divisions may also manage regulated investment companies.

Examples include Goldman Sachs Asset Management (a division of

Goldman Sachs & Co.) and Morgan Stanley Investment Management (a

division of Morgan Stanley). Money management activities generate fee

income based on a percentage of the assets under management.

```
Key Points

```

- Investment banking firms distribute newly issued securities and are
involved in the secondary market as market makers and brokers.

- Before 1990, the Glass-Steagall Act separated the activities of
commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies, thereby
restricting the types of securities that commercial banks in the United States
could underwrite, an important investment banking activity.

- The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999
supplanted the Glass-Steagall Act and eliminated the restrictions on the
activities conducted by companies in each financial sector, so that
commercial banks as well as insurance companies can underwrite
securities.

- Firms involved in the activities of investment banking fall into two
categories: bank-affiliated investment banks and independent investment
banks.

- Investment banking firms are highly leveraged companies.
- The services performed by investment banking firms include the public
- ffering (underwriting) of securities, trading of securities, private placement
- f securities, securitization of assets, mergers and acquisitions, merchant
banking, advising on financial restructuring, securities finance, prime
brokerage, trading and creation of derivative instruments, and asset

management.

- Full-service investment banking firms engage in many activities
associated with investment banking; boutique investment banking firms
specialize in one or a few of these activities.

- In the United States, the traditional process for issuing new securities
involves (1) advising the issuer on the terms and the timing of the offering,
(2) buying the securities from the issuer, and (3) distributing the issue to the
public.

- Underwriting is the function of buying the securities from the issuer, with
the investment banking firm accepting the risk of selling the securities to
investors at a lower price.

- In a firm-commitment underwriting arrangement, the investment banking
firm agrees to buy the securities from the issuer.

- In a best-efforts underwriting arrangement, the investment banking firm
does not buy the entire issue from the issuer but instead agrees only to use
its expertise to sell the securities.

- The gross spread earned by an investment banker is the difference
between the price paid to the issuer and the price at which the investment
bank then offers the security to the public.

- A new common stock offering is classified as an initial public offering
(IPO) or as a secondary common stock offering.

- An IPO is a common stock offering issued by companies that have not
previously issued common stock to the public. A secondary common stock

- ffering is an offering of common stock that had been issued in the past by
the corporation.

- To share the risk of capital loss that may be incurred by a single
investment banking firm's underwriting of an issue, an investment banking
firm puts together an underwriting syndicate.

- A selling group is put together for an underwriting to increase the
potential investor base.

- Various strategies are employed by traders to generate revenue from
positions in one or more securities: riskless arbitrage, risk arbitrage, and
speculation.

- A riskless arbitrage trade calls for a trader to find a security or package of
securities trading at different prices.

- Certain trading strategies are believed to carry a low level of risk, and
because of the risk exposure, such trading strategies are unfortunately
labeled risk arbitrage.

- Proprietary trading (prop trading) involves a trader positioning the firm's
capital to take advantage of a specific anticipated movement of prices or a
spread between two prices.

- The Volcker Rule as adopted prohibits a banking entity from (1) engaging
in proprietary trading and (2) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in

- r sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund.
- Exceptions to the Volcker Rule are defined for certain trading activities,
such as underwriting activities, market making-related activities, and riskmitigating hedging activities.

- There is a concern that the Volcker Rule might have an unintended
adverse impact on the liquidity of certain types of securities.

- Investment banking firms assist in the private placement of securities as
- pposed to the public offering of securities.
- Investment banking firms create asset-backed securities or work with
clients to create such securities.

- Investment banking firms generate revenue from mergers and
acquisitions (M&As), which include leveraged buyouts (LBOs),
restructuring and recapitalization of companies, and the reorganization of
bankrupt and troubled companies.

- Investment bankers may participate in M&A activity in one of several
ways: (1) by finding M&A candidates; (2) by advising acquiring companies

- r target companies with respect to price and nonprice terms of an
exchange, or by helping target companies fend off an unfriendly takeover
attempt; and (3) by assisting acquiring companies in obtaining the
necessary funds to finance a purchase.

- Merchant banking refers to an investment banking firm committing its
- wn funds by either taking an equity interest or a creditor position in
companies.

- Financial restructuring involves a significant modification of a
corporation's capital structure, operating structure, or corporate strategy
with the objective of improving efficiency.

- Securities lending is an activity whereby an investment banking firm puts
together borrowers and lenders of securities.

- Securities lending is part of the more general area known as securities
finance.

- Prime brokerage is a fee-driven activity whereby an investment banking
firm provides a package of services to hedge fund and large institutional
investors. The services may include securities finance (i.e., securities
lending and the financing of securities), global custody, operational support,
and risk management systems.

- Investment banking firms generate revenue from derivatives markets
from (1) commissions on the trading of exchange-traded instruments by
clients and (2) income from being counterparties to clients that want to take
a position in an over-the-counter or dealer-created derivative instrument.

- Full-service investment banks have divisions that manage assets for
various clients, such as insurance companies, endowments, foundations,
corporate and public pension funds, and high-net-worth individuals.

   - how financial innovation can be classified and how the classifications

relate to managing the various forms of risk.

Read any publication dealing with a topic in finance, and undoubtedly you

will see the term "risk" used. Listen to any business program on television or

radio, and it is highly likely that you will hear the term "risk" used in

different ways. The reason is that the term is a general concept that has

different meanings in finance. As we will explain in this chapter, there are

different types of risks that arise in different contexts. So unless one qualifies

what type of risk one is referring to, what is meant by the term will be

unclear. For example, we will see that financial markets have a wide range

- f market participants with varying tolerances for different types of risk. The
risk one market participant is willing to accept is not necessarily the risk
acceptable to another participant. The development of well-functioning
financial markets involves the creation of risk-reducing instruments to
transfer some form of risk from one market participant who wants to reduce

- r eliminate the exposure to that risk to another who is willing to accept that
same risk.

In this chapter, we provide an overview of the different types of financial

risk that will be referred to throughout this book and the general principles

- f managing risk, referred to as "risk management." This chapter covers a
wide range of topics, some of which were mentioned earlier in this book and
some of which will be taken up in more detail in later chapters.

```
Defining Risk

```

There is no shortage of definitions of risk. The word "risk" is derived from

the Italian verb _riscare_, which means "to dare." In Chinese, risk or venture

(fēng xiǎn) is expressed as two symbols, the first meaning danger and the

second meaning opportunity. In everyday parlance, risk is often viewed as

something that is negative, such as a danger, a hazard, or a loss. But we

know that some risks lead to economic gains, whereas others have purely

negative consequences. For example, although the purchase of a lottery

ticket involves an action that results in the risk of losing an amount equal to

the cost of the ticket, it potentially has a substantial monetary reward. In

contrast, the risk of death or injury from a random shooting is a purely

negative consequence.

Businesses recognize that accepting risk is necessary to obtain the

competitive advantage that leads to the generation of profits. Introducing a

new product or expanding production facilities involves both return and risk.

When a business is exposed to an event that can cause a shortfall to a

targeted financial measure or value, this is a financial risk that it faces. The

financial measure or value could be some measure of the company's profit,

such as earnings per share or return on the amount invested by the

company's owners. The financial goals for households are monetary

- bjectives, such as accumulating a target dollar amount from saving and
investing to purchase a car or home, financing the costs of a child's college
education, or funding retirement at some target age. When seeking to
achieve financial goals, households must accept the risk associated with the
financial assets in which they invest and the risks associated with the
investment strategies that they employ.

```
Risk versus Uncertainty

```

When formulating theories about how assets are valued in the financial

market, the assumption made is that when facing risk, investors pursue

plausible decision rules to select assets. Theories in corporate finance

likewise assume that when facing risk, management will follow rules that are

plausible as it makes key financial decisions that have an impact on the

firm's value. The rules that are applied in decision making by both investors

and managers are based on their beliefs regarding the set of outcomes that

can result from a decision. In formulating those beliefs about outcomes,

theories in finance assume that investors and managers can draw on

probabilities to quantify the risk associated with outcomes.

We often refer to risk as the uncertainty regarding what may happen in

the future. But is risk equivalent to uncertainty? Economists have argued this

question of "risk as uncertainty" or "risk versus uncertainty." The distinction

between risk and uncertainty was first made in 1921 by two economists,

Frank Knight [1] and John Maynard Keynes. [2] The distinction that Knight made

between risk and uncertainty is as follows. He argued that "risk" applies to

decision making in which the outcome of the decision is unknown, but the

decision maker can fairly accurately quantify the probability associated with

each outcome that may arise from that decision. Knight referred to this risk

as "measurable risk" or "risk proper." In contrast, Knight viewed uncertainty

as applying to decisions in which the decision maker cannot know all the

information needed to determine all probabilities associated with the

- utcomes. This situation gives rise to what is referred to as **Knightian**
**uncertainty** and what Knight referred to as "unmeasurable uncertainty" or
"true uncertainty."

Knight provides the following example to help distinguish between risk

and uncertainty. Consider an urn that includes red and black balls. Two

individuals are drawing from the urn. The first individual has no information

about the number of red and number of black balls in the urn and assumes

there is an equal probability of drawing a ball of either color. In contrast, the

second individual has information that the urn contains three red balls for

each black ball. This means that the second individual knows that for every

four balls in the urn, three are red and, therefore, the probability of drawing a

red ball is 75% and the probability of drawing a black ball is 25%.

According to Knight, the second individual faces risk, whereas the first

individual faces uncertainty.

John Maynard Keynes made a similar distinction, arguing that there is

risk that can be calculated and another sort of risk he labeled "irreducible

uncertainty." Keynes recognized that in some decisions, the risks cannot be

calculated, because attempting to do so would require relying on

assumptions about the future that have no basis in probability theory.

In practice, is the distinction between risk and uncertainty made by

Knight and Keynes of importance in decision making? This is a longrunning debate among economists: Some have argued that the two concepts

are the same, but others argue that the distinction is crucial. The global

financial crisis of 2008–2009, however, provided support for the KnightKeynes view of the distinction between risk and uncertainty. One of the

major factors that contributed to the financial crisis was the failure of risk

management models to warn about the financial problems leading to the

financial crisis. It appears that the management of financial entities thought

they had adequate risk models to prevent a major collapse in the financial

system. That is, management of financial entities failed to recognize that

they were dealing with situations that involved Knightian uncertainty or

Keynes's irreducible uncertainty.

More recently, Nassim Taleb has popularized the term _black swan event_

to characterize a high-impact, hard-to-predict, and rare event that is beyond

the realm of normal expectations based on historical events in financial

markets, technology, and the sciences. [3] In the context of financial markets, a

"high-impact event" means that the event has a large monetary impact.

Basically, a black swan event is a surprise to the decision maker and after the

event has occurred, the failure to consider such an event is inappropriately

rationalized. Linking this to Knightian uncertainty, black swan events are

presumed not to exist.

```
Systematic Risk versus Idiosyncratic Risk

```

In the study of financial markets, one of the key issues covered in this book

is asset pricing. To determine the fair value of an asset and how an asset's

value will change over time, the factors that drive (i.e., affect) asset

valuation must be determined. Because the factors affect asset valuation,

they are referred to as "risk factors." However, for simplicity in our

discussion here, we will refer to them as simply "factors."

Because the factors are assumed to affect the valuation of all assets in an

asset class, they are referred to as **common risk factors** - r **systematic risks** .

In addition to systematic risks, there are factors that may be unique to the

issuer of a particular asset. This risk is referred to as **idiosyncratic risk** . For

example, in later chapter 14 we discuss systematic factors for common

stock. Examples of idiosyncratic risk for a company would be a prolonged

strike by its employees, an uninsured natural disaster that destroys a

principal manufacturing plant, the expropriation of major overseas

manufacturing facilities by the government of the country in which the

facilities are located, or a patent infringement by the company.

In chapter 14, we review theories about the pricing of assets. These

theories tell us that in markets that operate efficiently when pricing assets,

investors should only be compensated for accepting systematic risks. In

- ther words, assets price only systematic risks. The reason is that, according
to one of the major theories in finance, idiosyncratic risk can be eliminated
through the proper selection of assets so as to create a diversified portfolio.
In contrast, one cannot eliminate systematic risks by creating a diversified
portfolio. Hence, systematic risks are referred to as **nondiversifiable risks**,
and idiosyncratic risk is referred to as **diversifiable risk** .

```
Financial Risk Management

```

Financial risk management involves the following activities:

identifying financial risks,

quantifying each identified risk, and

evaluating how to deal with each identified risk.

```
Identifying Financial Risks

```

Not all risks faced by households, financial entities, and businesses are easy

to identify. Some risks, unfortunately, are identified only after a financial

problem or financial crisis occurs. The three general categories of financial

risk that businesses, financial entities, and households face are (1)

investment risk, (2) funding risk, and (3) systemic financial risk. We

describe each of these risks in later sections of this chapter.

```
Quantifying Risks

```

Not all risks can be quantified. In finance, financial metrics have been used

to quantify many of the risks described later in this chapter. These metrics

draw on concepts in the fields of probability and statistics. This is the

principal reason that it is critical for students interested in the study of

finance to have a strong background in probability and statistics.

All models used in finance to measure risk are based on assumptions and

estimated parameters. Some market observers argue that it was the failure of

risk models used for quantifying risk of financial institutions that resulted in

the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. This is why it is critical to understand

the underlying assumptions of the risk measures and models discussed

throughout this book. The Knight-Keynes distinction between risk and

uncertainty should always be kept in mind when using and applying a risk

measure when managing financial risk.

```
Evaluating How to Deal With Each Identified Risk

```

Once the relevant risks are identified, corporate and household risk

management involves evaluating how to deal with each risk. This is the **risk**

**retention decision**, because it involves determining which risks to retain.

The choices for dealing with each risk are:

retaining the risk,

neutralizing the risk, or

transferring the risk.

Of course, each identified risk can be treated differently. For each of the

three choices—retention, neutralization, and transfer—there are in turn

further decisions as to how the risk should be handled.

**`Retained risk`** The decision as to which identified risks a business or a

household should retain is based on an economic analysis of the expected

benefits versus expected costs associated with bearing that particular risk.

Aggregating all the risks across any risk that a business or household has

elected to bear produces what is called its **retained risk** . Any retained risk

realized will have a potential adverse economic impact. In the case of a

business, it may adversely impact earnings, cash flow, and the value of the

business; for a household, it may have an adverse impact on income and net

worth.

With respect to businesses, an **unfunded retained risk** is a retained risk

for which potential losses are not financed until they occur. In contrast, a

**funded retained risk** is one for which an appropriate amount is set aside up

front (either as cash or as an identified source for raising funds) to absorb the

potential loss. The management of retained risk is referred to as **risk**

**finance** .

**`Risk neutralization`** If a business or household elects not to retain an

identified risk, there are two alternatives: neutralize the risk or transfer the

risk. **Risk neutralization** is a risk management policy whereby a business or

household acts on its own behalf to mitigate the outcome of an expected loss

from an identified risk without transferring that risk to a third party.

A risk neutralization strategy can involve mitigating the probability of the

identified risk occurring or reducing the severity of the loss should the

identified risk in fact occur. For a business, a risk neutralization strategy for

some risks may be a natural outcome of the business itself or of financial

factors affecting the business. For example, suppose that a company projects

an annual loss of \$100 million to \$150 million from returns because of

product defects, and this amount is material relative to the company's

profitability. A company could introduce improved manufacturing processes

to reduce the probability of defect for each item produced. This would

reduce both the variance of the number of defective products and the

expected number of defective products. Alternatively, the company could

implement an exchange policy to reduce the loss per defective product.

Either strategy could reduce the upper range of the potential loss.

As an example involving a financial factor, a Japanese-headquartered

company operating in both Japan and in countries in the Eurozone will likely

have cash inflows and outflows in euros. As a result, the company faces one

- f the investment risks discussed later in this chapter, foreign exchange-rate
risk: the risk that the exchange rate moves adversely to the company's
exposure in that currency. But this risk has offsetting tendencies if there are
both cash inflows and outflows in the same currency. Assuming that the
currency is the euro, the cash inflows are exposed to a depreciation of the
euro relative to the Japanese yen; the cash outflows are exposed to an
appreciation of the euro relative to the Japanese yen. If the company projects
future cash inflows over a certain period of €80 million and a cash outflow

- ver the same period of €70 million, then the company's net currency
exposure is a €10 million cash inflow. That is, €70 million exposure is
hedged naturally.

**`Risk transfer`** For certain identifiable risks, a company may decide to
transfer the risk to a third party. This can be done either by entering into a
contract with another party willing to take on the risk or by embedding that
risk in some type of security (i.e., creating a market instrument whose payoff
depends on the outcome of the risk).

Let's consider households first. The most common risk transfer vehicle

used is an insurance policy. For example, home and auto insurance sold by

P&C companies are vehicles used by households to obtain both asset

protection resulting from some event and protection of a household's wealth

that potentially could be put at risk from a lawsuit in which a home or auto

was involved. Life insurance policies are available to provide a guaranteed

sum of money to the beneficiaries as a result of the loss of income due to the

death of the household's principal wage earner; annuities, discussed in

chapter 8, can be used to provide an income stream for retirement. There are

- ther types of insurance, such as medical insurance and disability insurance.
Basically, insurance policies transfer risks from households to insurance
companies.

Businesses also use insurance companies to protect assets and mitigate

the damage that can be done by those assets. There are capital market

instruments called "financial derivatives" (or simply "derivatives") that

provide for the efficient transfer of risk. Although derivatives are too often

mischaracterized in the popular press as speculative vehicles that can cause

havoc in the financial markets, when properly utilized by market

participants, they can reduce the types of risks already mentioned and

described later in this chapter.

In addition to derivatives, capital market instruments have been created

using structured finance technology to transfer risk that was previously taken

- n by financial institutions (such as banks and insurance companies) to the
investing public. A few examples will illustrate this type of instrument. At

- ne time, depository institutions originated commercial loans to corporations
and consumer loans to individuals to purchase a home (residential property);
these institutions retained those loans in their portfolios. The risks associated
with the loans were borne by the depository institution. Because the loans
were held in the portfolio of depository institutions, they tied up much
needed capital. It is expected that regulatory capital requirements [4] for
depository institutions (i.e., how much capital a depository institution must
have) will increase over time due to changing regulations. As a result, it is
expected that the world's depository institutions will not have sufficient
capital to provide loans to governments, businesses, and consumers

throughout the world. One of the solutions that depository institutions have

adopted is to sell bonds that are backed by a pool (i.e., package) of loans that

they originated. The investors in these bonds then look for their payment not

from the depository institution that created the bonds but from borrowers

whose loans are in the pool of loans. The bonds created are referred to as

"securitized products" or "asset-backed securities," and the process of

creating them is referred to as **asset securitization** .

The asset securitization process, which we describe in much more detail

in chapter 27, transfers the risks associated with the pool of loans from the

depository institution that created the asset-backed securities to the investors

who purchase these securities. However, it has been argued that asset

securitization was responsible for the financial crisis that began in the

summer of 2007. As a result, asset securitization is viewed, much like

derivatives, as an "evil" capital market mechanism that seeks to exploit the

general public. We discuss the merits of this view in chapter 27. Here we

- nly note that governments throughout the world have either adopted or
proposed legislation that would foster the development of asset
securitization.

Although asset securitization is often used by depository institutions,

- perating companies use this process to remove the risks associated with the
loans they grant to customers. For example, automobile manufacturers make
loans to customers for the purpose of purchasing an automobile. Automobile
manufacturers can retain those loans and bear the risk associated with them.

By pooling automobile loans to create asset-backed securities, automobile

manufacturers transfer those risks to the investors who buy the securities.

Asset securitization is not the only type of capital market instrument for

transferring risk. Asset securitization is a type of **structured finance**

**vehicle**, which we describe in chapter 27. Here is one example of the type of

capital market instruments that insurance companies have created to transfer

specific risks.

P&C companies are concerned with catastrophic events that can cause

major losses. For example, the heavy rainfalls in France at the beginning of

June 2016 resulted in insured losses that were expected to be as much as

€600 million (U.S.\$682 million). It is estimated that more than 1,000 natural

catastrophes occurred in 2015, resulting in overall insured losses of \$31

billion. [5] To transfer the risk of such catastrophes to investors willing to

accept this insurance risk by potentially earning a higher interest rate, P&C

companies created catastrophe bonds (nicknamed "cat bonds"). The payoff

to an investor in a cat bond depends on whether a qualifying catastrophe or

event occurs. If it does, the bondholders will lose part or all of the principal

they invested, and the P&C company that issued the cat bond can use the

funds not paid to bondholders to recoup some or all of the losses from the

event.

```
Investment Risk

```

In very general terms, **investment risk** refers to the likelihood that an

investment or an investment strategy will have a performance outcome that

is less than what the investor expected. In the general category of investment

risk are various types of risk that can result in below-expected performance.

These risks include

credit risk,

price risk,

reinvestment risk,

inflation risk,

liquidity risk, and

foreign exchange-rate risk.

```
Credit Risk

```

**Credit risk** is a major risk in the financial system. This type of risk
encompasses many forms of risk, and there is no standard definition as to
what it means.

Most market participants refer to credit risk in the context of the failure

- f a borrower in a lending agreement to satisfy the contractual obligation to
make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal. Lending
agreements include loans and bonds. Used in this way, credit risk refers to
**default risk** . For example, when an individual borrows money from a bank
to purchase a home, the lending arrangement exposes the lending bank to

default risk—the risk that the borrower will fail to repay the loan. When in

April 2013, Apple issued \$17 billion of bonds, the purchasers of those bonds

were exposed to default risk—the risk that Apple would not be able to make

the interest payments or repay the principal when it comes due.

Although the term "credit risk" is most commonly used in the context as

just described, credit risk in a broader sense means the failure of a

counterparty to a transaction to fulfill its obligation. This form of credit risk,

referred to as **counterparty risk**, exists not only in financial market

transactions but also in many transactions in everyday life. Here are two

examples of such transactions. When an individual purchases a one-year

subscription to a magazine and pays for that subscription fee upfront, there is

the risk that the magazine publisher will go out of business and therefore not

fulfill its obligation to deliver the magazine. When an individual pays for a

service prior to its performance, there is the risk that the service provider

will fail to perform. Service providers often request "advances" or

"deposits" before undertaking a service.

Many transactions in financial markets involve counterparty risk. We will

see this when we discuss private transactions throughout this book. For

example, suppose that on May 1, 2014, an investor enters into a transaction

with a financial institution in which the two parties agree to the following.

For a sum of \$264,000 paid by the investor to the financial institution at the

time the agreement is entered into, the financial institution agrees to allow

the investor to purchase 10,000 shares of company X for \$200 per share on

May 1, 2018. As explained in chapter 34, this transaction is a special type of

derivative transaction called an "option." At the time of the transaction,

suppose that on May 1, 2014, the price of a share of company X's stock was

\$132. Hence, this agreement allows the investor to benefit from a rise in the

price of company X’s stock above \$200. No matter what happens to

company X's stock four years later on May 1, 2018, the investor forgoes the

\$264,000 payment. On May 1, 2018, suppose Company X’s stock price was

\$448 per share. This transaction would generate a profit for the investor as

follows. The investor would purchase the company X's stock from the

financial institution at the agreed-on price of \$200 per share. This would

require the payment for 10,000 shares of $2,000,000 (= $200 × 10,000). The

total cost of acquiring the 10,000 shares would be \$2,264,000, which is the

\$2,000,000 needed to purchase the stock plus the \$264,000 to enter the

agreement on May 1, 2014. The value of the 10,000 shares on May 1, 2018

would be $4,480,000 (= $448 × 10,000), resulting in a profit of \$2,216,000.

However, suppose that when the investor requests that the financial

institution perform its part of the agreement, this counterparty does not have

the financial ability to do so. This is counterparty risk.

Derivative transactions of the sort described above are very common in

financial markets, and there is a major concern about counterparty risk in the

financial system. An extreme example of counterparty risk that underscores

its critical importance was the bankruptcy of a major financial institution,

Lehman Brothers Holding Inc., in September 2008. At the time, this firm

was the counterparty in many private transactions involving derivative

instruments, and its bankruptcy resulted in the failure to satisfy its

- bligations in these transactions. Moreover, the firm also borrowed funds so
the firm's creditors realized default risk, because Lehman was unable to
repay its debt obligations.

Admittedly, default risk and counterparty risk seem very much like the

same type of risk, namely, the risk that one party to a transaction will fail to

perform, and, in fact, many market participants do use the terms

interchangeably. If one wanted a way to distinguish between the two risks,

the examples above should serve. The term "default risk" is commonly used

to describe a lending arrangement in which the borrower fails to perform.

"Counterparty risk" is the term typically used when the failure occurs in a

derivative transaction that is not a lending or a funding arrangement. Some

market participants refer to counterparty risk as "counterparty default risk."

Credit risk encompasses one more type of risk, which might best be

explained with an illustration. Let's consider once again the Apple bonds. At

the time that they were issued, the price of those bonds reflected the default

risk as perceived by market participants. As discussed in chapter 11, by

"price," we mean the interest rate that Apple will have to pay to bondholders

when it issues the bonds. The greater the perceived default risk, the higher

the interest rate Apple will have to pay. That interest rate is made up of at

least two components. The first component is the interest rate that investors

want for holding a bond that has no default risk. The second component is

compensation for the default risk perceived by investors. That additional

compensation for default risk above the interest rate on a default-free bond is

referred to as the **credit spread** . That credit spread is not constant over the

life of the bond. The risk that an investor in Apple bonds faces is that

sometime in the future, the market will view Apple as having a greater

default risk and as a result will require a greater credit spread, which will

have an adverse impact on the price of the bond. This aspect of credit risk is

referred to as **credit spread risk** .

**`Measuring credit risk`** The measurement of default risk and counterparty
risk requires an analysis of the ability of the issuer or counterparty to meet
its obligations. Professional asset managers analyze an issuer's financial
information and the specifications of the debt instrument itself to estimate
the ability of the issuer to live up to its future contractual obligations. This
activity is known as **credit analysis** . Most large institutional investors have
their own credit analysis department not only to assess the credit risk of an
issuer/counterparty but also to determine limits on how much exposure to
that issuer or counterparty is acceptable. Banks maintain credit departments
for assessing credit risk. The credit analysts in these departments develop
**internal ratings** that are used when making lending decisions.

Investors who do not have access to their own credit analysis use, to

different degrees, opinions about default risk as provided by the credit rating

agencies who perform credit analysis and cast their opinion in the form of a

credit rating. As explained in chapter 5, the three major rating agencies are

S&P, Moody's, and Fitch, although more firms have entered the rating

business over the past few years.

Criticism of the performance of credit rating agencies have led to service

providers formulating credit scoring models and credit risk models for

evaluating credit risk. Let's look first at credit scoring models.

A **credit scoring model** takes information about the attributes of a

borrower and through statistical analysis derives a **credit score** . Based on

the credit score, a lender may decide to grant a loan or to classify lenders

into different credit risk classes. For individuals, the best-known credit

scoring model is one used to construct the FICO score. The model assigns a

percentage weight to such factors as length of credit history and amount

- wed, all information provided by credit bureaus, to derive the FICO score.
The FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850 (with higher scores
indicating a better credit rating), is used to measure credit risk for consumer
credit decisions, such as mortgage lending, auto loans, and credit card lines

- f credit. For corporations and governments, **credit risk models** have been
developed to determine the probability of default and, if a default does

- ccur, how much will be recovered.

**`Market instruments for controlling credit risk`** Because of the
importance of controlling credit risk, several credit risk transfer vehicles are
available in the market. Some of these vehicles are derivatives, referred to as
"credit derivatives," with the type most commonly used by investors called
"credit default swaps." In addition, securitized products (known as
collateralized loan obligations) have been created that are issued by banks,
and there are bonds (known as credit-linked notes) issued by corporations
that use structured finance. These credit risk transfer vehicles are the subject

- f chapter 39.

```
Price Risk

```

The price of an asset will change over time. That is, the price can increase or

decrease. The concern to an investor who owns an asset is that the price will

decrease. For example, suppose an investor purchased the stock of General

Electric Company on November 12, 2015, for \$30.41 per share. The price

risk that this investor faces is that the price per share would decline below

\$30.41. On August 1, 2018, the price for the stock was \$13.63, which would

have resulted in a loss of \$16.78 per share.

One might be tempted to say that price risk is the risk of a decline in the

price of an asset. However, that is not true because of a position that one can

take in an asset. Buying an asset does in fact result in a loss if the price

declines. When an investor buys an asset, the investor is said to be "long the

asset," or to be in a long position for that asset. However, an alternative

position is to be "short the asset," which means that the investor has sold an

asset, even though the investor did not own the asset sold. This may sound

like a criminal act. However, the ability to sell an asset that is not owned,

referred to as "selling short," is a critical aspect of financial markets that

allows asset prices to reflect their true values. We'll have more to say about

the mechanisms available in the market for short selling and the economic

role of short selling in later chapters. What is important here is that for a

short position, price risk is the risk that the price will increase. Let's consider

- nce again the stock of General Electric on November 12, 2015, for \$30.41
per share. Now suppose that instead of buying that stock, the investor sold
the stock short for \$30.41 per share. On April 19, 2016, the stock price was
\$31.14. This means that if the investor had to produce the stock on that day
(which is referred to as “covering the short position”), the investor would
have had to pay \$31.14 to buy the stock. Because the investor sold the stock
for \$30.41, this investor would have realized a loss of \$0.73 per share.

So now we see that **price risk** is the risk of an adverse movement in the

price of a stock, which could result from either an increase or a decrease in

an asset's price, depending on the investor's position. A long position's price

risk is that the price will decline; a short position's price risk is that the price

will increase. In general, we can say that price risk is the risk of an

unfavorable movement in an asset's price.

What causes price risk? The starting point for answering this question is

to understand what factors cause an asset's price to change. Basically, this

means determining what drives an asset's price. So, to determine price risk,

we must at least understand qualitatively what variables drive an asset's

price. The variables that affect an asset's price are referred to as "risk

factors" or simply "factors." In the case of a stock, one might believe that the

price of the stock is affected by the earnings of a company, the growth of

those earnings, and the level of interest rates. It is reasonable to expect that

the factors driving the price of a bond are the level of interest rates in the

market and the issuer's credit rating.

**`Measuring price risk`** Given the factors that one would expect to drive an
asset's price, one must develop a model that links an asset's price sensitivity
to the factors. Such models are referred to as "asset pricing models." Given
an asset pricing model, one can measure an asset's price risk exposure to
each factor. That is, there may not be one measure of price risk for an asset
but one for each factor. The exposure of an asset to a factor is referred to as

its **factor beta** . The factor beta is estimated using various statistical models

incorporating historical returns for the asset.

In the case of debt obligations, such as bonds, the key drivers of the

change in a bond's price are the level of interest rates and the issuer's credit

risk. The level of interest rates is measured by the interest rate on what is

viewed as a default-free security, securities issued by the U.S. Department of

the Treasury. As mentioned earlier, the component of the interest rate that

reflects compensation for the issuer's credit risk is the credit spread

A mathematical relationship between the bond's price and these two

factors (i.e., Treasury rates and credit risk) can be developed to estimate the

exposure of a bond to each of these factors. In general, the term **duration** is

used to quantify the exposure of a bond's price to changes in Treasury

interest rates. We describe this measure in more detail in chapter 16. The

exposure of a bond's price to changes in the issuer's credit risk is referred to

as **credit spread duration**, because it refers to the exposure to changes in

the credit spread.

**`Market instruments for controlling price risk`** There are many
derivative instruments in the marketplace for controlling the price risk of an
individual asset and a portfolio of assets. We describe derivatives to control
price risk for common stock and derivatives to control exposure to interest
rate risk in part VIII of the book.

```
Reinvestment Risk

```

**Reinvestment risk** is the risk that when proceeds are received from an
investment, they will have to be invested at an interest rate that is less than
when the original investment was made.

Investors in bonds face reinvestment risk. First, when a bond is

purchased, one can compute the potential yield for that bond, as explained in

chapter 11. The yield calculated assumes that the bond is held to maturity

and that any interest payments can be reinvested from the time the interest

payment is received from the bond issuer until the bond matures. Here is an

example. Suppose that in May 1984, an investor purchased a bond issued by

the U.S. Treasury that matured in 30 years (i.e., it would have matured in

May 2014). The yield on that bond would have been approximately 13%.

That is, if one of those bonds had been purchased for \$1,000, the annual

interest rate that would have been paid by the U.S. Department of the

Treasury was \$130 per year or \$65 every six months. An investor would

typically say that a 13% yield was being earned. However, as explained in

chapter 11, this is the case only if (1) the interest received every six months

can be reinvested at an annual interest rate of 13%, and (2) the bond is held

to maturity (May 2014 in our example). A little knowledge of the history of

interest rates since the 1980s will make it clear why it is unlikely that the

interest payments received from the U.S. Treasury would not have allowed

for reinvestment at 13%. For example, 10 years after the bond was

purchased (i.e., in May 1994), the interest received would had to have been

reinvested in 20 years Treasury bonds, which at the time offered 7.5%, far

less than the reinvestment rate needed to generate a 13% yield. Moving

forward another 10 years to May 2004, when the interest received would had

to have been reinvested for another 10 years, the 10-year Treasury interest

rates were about 3.5%. Five years later, the interest received would have

been reinvested at 2.13%. Hence, one can see the reinvestment risk faced by

an investor who purchased the U.S. Treasury bonds in May 1984. How

serious is reinvestment risk? The amount of interest from the reinvestment of

the bond's interest to generate the expected 13% yield is substantial, as is

demonstrated in chapter 11. In contrast, if an investor in May 2014

purchased a 30-year Treasury bond, the yield at that time was only 3.4%,

and expectations were that the interest rate would not fall far below that rate.

Hence, the reinvestment risk would have been far less.

Another example of reinvestment risk faced by a bond investor arises

when the bond has a feature that allows the issuer to repurchase the bond

from the investor at some future date. This provision, referred to as a **call**

**provision**, is a benefit to the issuer, because it allows the issuer to retire the

bond issue if interest rates have declined since the time the bond was issued

and then issue new bonds at the lower interest rate. This call provision

results in reinvestment risk for the investor, who will then have to reinvest

the proceeds received from the issuer at a lower interest rate than when the

bonds were purchased.

```
Inflation Risk

```

Inflation occurs when the prices of most goods and services rise, resulting in

a reduction in purchasing power. When income rises at a rate less than the

inflation rate, then the standard of living of households declines. Failing to

take into account inflation when planning for retirement can result in a

retirement income supporting a lower standard of living than was expected.

When an investor invests in assets to generate retirement income, the **real**

**return** that the investor realizes is the return after adjusting for the inflation

rate. **Inflation risk**, also referred to as **purchasing power risk**, is the risk

that the nominal return earned (i.e., the return without considering inflation)

will be less than the inflation rate. Put differently, inflation risk is the risk of

earning a negative real return.

When investing in different asset classes, an investor is exposed to

different degrees of inflation risk. For example, historically, stocks and real

estate have been observed to expose investors to less inflation risk than do

bonds. Given that each asset class has a different exposure to inflation risk, a

portfolio composed of different asset classes will have an exposure to

inflation risk that depends on the allocation to each asset class.

Although the typical bond may have greater inflation risk than common

stock and real estate, there are bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the

Treasury, financial institutions, and nonfinancial corporations that have

protection against inflation risk. These bonds are referred to as **inflation-**

**adjusted bonds** (also called "linkers"). For such bonds, the interest rate or

the principal is indexed to the inflation rate. In addition, some derivatives

allow for the control of inflation risk.

```
Liquidity Risk

```

Liquidity allows investors the flexibility to rebalance a portfolio (i.e., by

buying and selling assets) in order to implement an investment strategy.

Liquidity can be viewed in terms of the potential loss that an investor may

realize if the investor wishes to sell immediately instead of engaging in a

costly and time-consuming search to identify a buyer willing to pay a higher

price. A financial asset's liquidity may depend on the quantity that the

investor wishes to sell (or buy). Although an investor may wish to sell a

small quantity of an asset that is liquid, there may be illiquidity if a large

quantity of the asset is to be sold.

As explained in chapter 9, although an asset's liquidity serves an

important function, there is no uniformly accepted definition of what

liquidity is. Several studies have defined liquidity in terms of the ability of

an investor to trade an asset at short notice at a low cost and without having

a significant adverse impact on the asset's price. **Liquidity risk** for an asset

can then be defined as the risk that when an investor executes a trade for that

asset, prevailing market conditions will be such that the cost will be higher

and there will be a significant adverse impact on the price at which the trade

is executed.

```
Foreign Exchange-Rate Risk

```

When an investor acquires an asset whose cash flows are not denominated in

the investor's domestic currency, the investor is really taking two positions

- a position in the asset and a position in the currency. If the investor has a
long position, there is the risk that the currency will change at the time of
receipt of the cash flow such that fewer units of the domestic currency are
realized. More specifically, the risk is that the currency in which a cash flow
is paid (i.e., the foreign currency) will depreciate relative to the domestic
currency. This risk is referred to as **foreign exchange-rate risk** - r **currency**
**risk** . Certain foreign exchange derivative products—the subject of chapter
38—can be used to control the degree of an investor's foreign exchange-rate
risk exposure.

There is potentially another risk associated with investing in an asset

whose cash flows are denominated in a foreign currency. A foreign

government may prevent its currency from being fully converted into a

convertible currency. (A convertible currency is one that can be freely

exchanged into another currency.) The risk of loss associated with an action

taken by a foreign government to make its currency inconvertible is called

**convertibility risk** .

```
Funding Risk

```

**Funding risk**, also referred to as **financing risk**, is the risk associated with

- btaining funds. There are four types of funding risk: leverage risk, funding
liquidity risk, timing risk, and fixed-floating financing risk.

```
Leverage Risk

```

When individuals or businesses borrow funds, they are said to be using

**financial leverage**, or simply, "leverage." Benefits and risks are associated

with the use of leverage by businesses. To understand them, we take as an

example the chief financial officer (CFO) of a corporation who is

considering borrowing \$400 million at a cost of 6% per year. The

corporation will deploy the proceeds received in various business activities

with the purpose of generating a rate of return that exceeds the cost of

borrowing (6% per year). The corporation benefits in terms of adding to its

profitability by the difference between the rate of return earned and the cost

- f borrowing. For example, if the corporation earns 8% on the \$400 million
borrowed, then the cost of the borrowed funds for the year is \$24 million
(6% × \$400 million), and the amount received from deploying the funds in
the business is \$32 million (8% × \$400 million). The difference of \$8
million adds to the corporation's profit. If the CFO borrowed even more
funds, the amount of profit added would have been even greater as long as
the corporation earned more than 6% per year.

What we have just described is the benefit of using leverage. The risk

should be obvious: it is the risk that the corporation fails to earn a return on

the amount borrowed greater than the cost of borrowing. In our illustration,

suppose that the corporation earns only 2% per year on the borrowed funds.

It thus paid \$24 million for the borrowed funds but generates only \$8

million, reducing its profitability as a result of the borrowing by \$16 million.

If the amount of leverage employed is such that the cost of all the borrowed

funds by the corporation results in the inability of the firm to pay its

contractual debt obligations, creditors will force the firm into bankruptcy.

**Leverage risk** is the adverse financial impact resulting from the use of
leverage. The degree of leverage of a corporation can be measured in two
ways: the debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio. The **debt ratio** is the
amount of funds provided by the corporation's creditors (referred to simply

as "debt") divided by the total amount of funds that the corporation has

available to invest (i.e., total assets). The basic financial accounting identity

is:

## Total assets = Equity + Debt.

Then total assets represent the amount of funds available for the corporation

to invest. The debt-to-equity ratio is:

The higher the debt ratio is, the greater will be the leverage used by the

corporation. For firms in the same industry, the higher the debt ratio is, the

greater the leverage risk will be.

The second way to calculate the degree of leverage is by computing the

**debt-to-equity ratio** :

The higher the debt-to-equity ratio is, the greater the leverage will be, and

therefore for firms in the same industry, the greater the leverage risk will be.

The decision regarding the amount of debt relative to equity that a

corporation should have (i.e., the degree of leverage) is referred to as its

"capital structure decision." There are various financial theories that suggest

the factors a corporation should consider when determining its optimal

capital structure.

In chapter 6, we described depository institutions, which include banks.

These financial institutions are highly leveraged. That is, the percentage of

funds they invest represents predominantly borrowed funds relative to the

equity raised from stockholders. The debt ratio for depository institutions is

roughly 92% (expressed as a percentage). The profitability of depository

institutions depends primarily on management's ability to invest in loans and

- ther debt obligations so as to earn a higher return than its cost of borrowing.

Households also borrow funds and thereby create leverage and face

leverage risk. The benefits associated with the use of leverage by households

are not as easy to quantify as those for corporations and depository

institutions. Households borrow to accelerate the purchase of goods and

services rather than to postpone any purchase until sufficient funds are

available for an outright purchase without borrowing. Certain purchases do

have economic benefits that households believe will accrue by borrowing.

Two examples are borrowing for college education and purchasing a home.

In the former case, the expectation is that the cost of borrowing for college

will generate lifetime future earnings that warrant the cost. In the case of the

purchase of a residence using borrowed funds, the belief is that ownership of

a home rather than renting will provide a benefit as a result of the potential

price appreciation of the home purchased. This was a belief shared by many

households prior to the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007.

```
Funding Liquidity Risk

```

It is not uncommon for participants in financial markets to be forced to settle

financial obligations immediately at the request of the lender. For example, a

bank's depositors for some reason may want to withdraw funds from a bank

at the same time. The bank must have the ability to satisfy those obligations

immediately. Another example is a highly leveraged investor whose

borrowing agreement grants the lender the right to request the immediate

payment of the amount borrowed. The ability of the borrower to settle its

debt obligations immediately is referred to as **funding liquidity** . **Funding**

**liquidity risk** is then the risk that over a specific horizon, an entity will not

be able to settle its obligations with immediacy.

```
Timing Risk

```

**Timing risk** is the risk associated with the timing of raising capital. More
specifically, it is the risk that the cost of obtaining funds will be higher than
expected at some future date when the funds are needed.

As an example of timing risk, consider a corporation that wants to raise

funds by borrowing in the marketplace. Suppose that in September 2008, a

corporation with a credit rating of BBB (the meaning of which we explain in

chapter 5) wanted to issue a \$400 million 20-year bond. The person in a

corporation responsible for determining how much to raise and when to raise

those funds is the CFO. Suppose that the CFO has determined that the \$400

million is not needed immediately. Instead, the CFO was considering either

issuing the bonds that day or sometime over the next five months. Let's look

at this CFO's decision using actual market interest rates. According to

interest rate data published by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate for such

a corporation seeking to borrow for 20 years and whose credit rating was

BBB would have been about 7.31% in September 2008. By issuing

immediately, the CFO would have locked in a cost of 7.31% for the next 20

years. Here is what the Federal Reserve reported as interest rates for the next

four months: October 2008, 8.38%; November 2008, 9.21%; December

2008, 8.49%; and January 2009, 8.19%. This was a period of considerable

interest rate volatility in the financial markets, as can be seen by the large

movement in interest rates over this five-month period. The timing risk faced

by the CFO was that by not issuing the bonds that day, the CFO placed the

company at risk of having to issue the bonds over the next four months at a

higher interest rate than it would have paid in September 2008. Indeed, that

is what happened, because the interest rates were higher for each of the four

months following September 2008.

Suppose the CFO decided not to issue the bond in September 2008, but

seeing that interest rates rose from 7.31% to 8.38% in one month and then

again in the following month (from 8.38% to 9.21%), the CFO decided to

issue the bonds in November 2008 at 9.21%. The timing risk that the CFO

faced when the decision was made to issue the bonds in November 2008 was

losing the opportunity to benefit from a decline in interest rates, which did in

fact occur in the next two months (8.49% and 8.19% in December 2008 and

January 2009, respectively).

State and local governments share the same timing risk as businesses.

They raise funds and are concerned with the interest rate that they must pay.

Because interest rates fluctuate, the risk is that they may have to raise funds

at a time when interest rates are higher than they currently are.

Although our illustration of timing risk involves raising funds in the form

- f borrowed money (bonds in our example), the CFO faces timing risk when
a decision must be made to raise funds by issuing common stock. To
understand this, suppose the CFO of a corporation wants to raise \$200
million by issuing common stock at a time when the common stock is \$100
per share. The funds are not needed immediately but sometime over the next
60 days. Ignoring the cost of issuing the common stock, this means that if

the CFO issues immediately, then two million shares (\$200 million/\$100)

would have to be issued. By postponing the issuance to take advantage of a

rise in the price of the corporation's common stock, the CFO takes the risk

that the stock's price will decline, forcing the corporation to issue more than

two million shares of common stock. By issuing more shares, the

corporation will have more shares outstanding, diluting corporate earnings

more than if it issued the common stock today.

Households face timing risk, particularly with the purchase of a home. A

household that has the capacity to purchase a home now with borrowed

funds at prevailing interest rates faces two forms of timing risk. The first is

that the interest rate at which it must borrow to purchase a home is known

today (called the mortgage rate), but postponement of the purchase may

result in having to pay a higher mortgage rate. The second is that if the

purchase is postponed to a future date, housing prices may increase,

resulting in the household having to borrow more to purchase a home.

```
Fixed-Floating Financing Risk

```

Another form of funding risk involves the decision to pay a fixed interest

rate over the entire time period for which the funds are borrowed (referred to

as **fixed-rate borrowing** ) or to pay an interest rate that varies periodically

( **variable-rate borrowing** - r **floating-rate borrowing** ). This form of

funding risk is referred to as **fixed-floating financing risk** .

With floating-rate borrowing, the interest rate is reset (i.e., changes) at

designated times and is reset according to a formula. The formula has two

components: a reference rate plus a constant amount. The **reference rate** is

some market interest rate that changes over time. For example, the most

common reference rate is the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), a rate

we discuss further in chapter 25. The constant amount is referred to as the

**margin** . So, as an example, the interest rate formula on a floating-rate debt

- bligation that resets every year might be one-year LIBOR plus 150 basis
points. In the formula, one-year LIBOR is the reference rate and the margin
is 150 basis points. Because the one-year LIBOR changes every year, the
rate that the borrower would pay varies every year while the debt obligation
is outstanding.

Let's consider a CFO of a U.S. corporation deciding whether to issue a

\$400 million bond that pays a fixed interest rate of 6% per year for the next

20 years. Alternatively, the CFO can issue a \$400 million floating-rate bond

whose interest rate resets every year based on the formula: one-year LIBOR

plus 150 basis points. Suppose that for the first year, one-year LIBOR is 3%.

Then for the first year, the borrowing cost for the \$400 million will be 4.5%

(3% + 150 basis points). This would be a clear advantage to borrowing on a

floating-rate basis. However, the risk is that over the next 19 years, one-year

LIBOR might rise above 4.5%, which would make borrowing on a fixed-rate

basis more advantageous. If the CFO selects the fixed-rate borrowing

alternative, then the risk is that one-year LIBOR will fall below 4.5%, so that

floating-rate borrowing would be more advantageous.

Fixed-floating financing is faced not only by businesses when

determining the form of financing that they will use but also by households

when they purchase a home with borrowed funds. When borrowing funds to

purchase a home, a household can select a loan that has a fixed rate over its

life or a floating rate over its life. A floating-rate loan to purchase a home is

referred to as an "adjustable-rate loan" and is described in chapter 29.

```
Systemic Financial Risk

```

In general, the term **systemic risk** refers to the probability that an entire

system will collapse or fail. When applied to finance, systemic risk is

referred to as **systemic financial risk** . [6] The example typically given to

illustrate systemic financial risk is a run on a bank (i.e., bank depositors

simultaneously withdrawing their funds from a bank). Prior to the protection

- ffered to bank depositors in the United States through federal deposit
insurance, the inability of one bank to meet the demands for the withdrawal

- f deposits caused not only the failure of that bank but also triggered a chain
reaction that produced runs on other banks, causing them to fail.

In 2007 the U.S. Congress, following the problems faced in certain

sectors of the financial market in that year, held hearings under the title

"Systemic Risk: Examining Regulators' Ability to Respond to Threats to the

Financial System." Yet despite the concern about systemic financial risk

threat to the global financial system, there is no universally accepted

definition of what that risk is. In a 2007 speech, then governor of the Federal

Reserve Board Frederic Mishkin defined systemic financial risk as follows:

When we speak of systemic risk, we mean the risk of a sudden, usually unexpected, disruption of

information flows in financial markets that prevents them from channeling funds to those who have

the most productive profit opportunities. [7]

He then went on to say:

We have seen how systemic risk, when it becomes especially severe, can result in financial crises—the

seizing up of financial markets—which can have potentially important economic consequences.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provides the following

definition of systemic financial risk:

The risk that the failure of a participant to meet its contractual obligations may in turn cause other

participants to default with a chain reaction leading to broader financial difficulties. [8]

Although there is no universally accepted definition of systemic financial

risk, the basic notion is clear. The interconnectedness of financial institutions

throughout the world can, by contagion, cause major disruptions to the

global financial system. In chapter 2, we gave examples of this concern

when we discussed government intervention in the financial market.

```
Financial Innovation

```

Since the 1960s, there has been a surge in the number of significant financial

innovations. Observers of financial markets categorize these innovations in

different ways. Below we describe just two possible ways of classifying

these financial innovations. With an understanding of the risks described in

this chapter, the reasons for financial innovation should be clear.

The Economic Council of Canada classifies financial innovations in the

following three broad categories: [9]

    **Market-broadening instruments**, which increase the liquidity of

markets and the availability of funds by attracting new investors and

   - ffering new opportunities for borrowers.

    - **Risk management instruments**, which reallocate financial risks to

those who are less averse to them or who have offsetting exposure, and

who are presumably better able to shoulder them.

    - **Arbitraging instruments and processes**, which enable investors and

borrowers to take advantage of differences in costs and returns between

markets, and which reflect differences in the perception of risks, as well

as in information, taxation, and regulations.

Another classification system of financial innovations based on more

specific functions has been suggested by the BIS: price risk-transferring

innovations, credit risk-transferring instruments, liquidity-generating

innovations, credit-generating instruments, and equity-generating

instruments. [10] **Price risk-transferring innovations** provide market

participants with more efficient means for dealing with price or exchangerate risk. Reallocating the risk of default is the function of credit risktransferring instruments. Liquidity-generating innovations do three things:

(1) they increase the liquidity of the market; (2) they allow borrowers to

draw on new sources of funds; and (3) they allow market participants to

circumvent capital constraints imposed by regulations. Instruments to

increase the amount of debt funds available to borrowers and to increase the

capital base of financial and nonfinancial institutions are the functions of

**credit-generating innovations** and **equity-generating** **innovations**,

respectively.

As you read the chapters on the various sectors of the financial markets

that we review in this book, it is important to understand the factors behind

any innovations in that market.

```
Key Points

```

- Many forms of risk are faced by participants in the financial markets.
   - There is a difference between risk and uncertainty, as was first
pointed out in 1921 by two economists, Frank Knight and John
Maynard Keynes.

   - Knight argued that risk applies in situations where the decision maker
can fairly accurately quantify the probability associated with each

   - utcome that may arise from that decision; he referred to this risk as
"measurable risk" or "risk proper."

   - Knightian uncertainty exists when the decision maker cannot know
all the information needed to determine all the probabilities associated

with the outcomes of a decision. This form of uncertainty was referred

to by Knight as "unmeasurable uncertainty" or "true uncertainty."

- Keynes made a similar distinction between risk and uncertainty,
referring to the latter as "irreducible uncertainty."

- The risks that affect the value of an asset can be classified as

systematic risks and idiosyncratic risks.

- Systematic risks or common risk factors are those risks that affect the
valuation of all assets in an asset class. Because they cannot be
diversified away, they are also referred to as "nondiversifiable risks."

- Idiosyncratic risk is a risk that is unique to an issuer. Because it can
be diversified away in a portfolio, it is referred to as "diversifiable
risk."

- The financial risks faced by businesses, financial entities, and
households are (1) investment risk, (2) funding risk, and (3) systemic
financial risk.

- Broadly speaking, investment risk refers to the probability that the
- utcome realized by an investment or an investment strategy will be
below what the investor expected.

- Financial risk management involves (1) identifying financial risks,
(2) quantifying each identified risk, and (3) evaluating how to deal with
each identified risk.

- Once the relevant risks are identified, risk management involves
assessing which risks to retain, with the choices being (1) retaining a
risk, (2) neutralizing a risk, or (3) transferring a risk.

- Retained risk is the aggregate of all risks that a business or household
has elected to bear.

- An unfunded retained risk is a retained risk for which potential losses
are not financed until they occur; a funded retained risk is a retained
risk for which an appropriate amount has been set aside up front (either
as cash or as an identified source for raising funds) to absorb the
potential loss.

- There are two alternatives for dealing with risks that are not retained:
neutralize the risk or transfer the risk.

- Risk neutralization is a risk management policy whereby a business
- r household acts on its own behalf to mitigate the outcome of an
expected loss from an identified risk without transferring that risk to a
third party.

- An entity may decide to transfer the risk to a third party by either
entering into a contract with another party willing to take on the risk
that an entity wishes to transfer or by taking a position in a market
instrument whose payoff depends on the outcome of the risk that the
entity wishes to transfer to the public.

- Capital market instruments have been created using structured
finance technology to transfer risk that was previously taken by
financial institutions, with asset securitization being one example.

- Investment risk includes price risk, credit risk, reinvestment risk,
inflation risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange-rate risk.

- Credit risk encompasses default risk and credit spread risk.
- Several credit risk transfer vehicles are available in the market.
- Price risk is the risk of an adverse movement in the price of an asset
that could result from an increase or decrease in an asset's price,
depending on the investor's position: A long position's price risk is that
the price will decline, and a short position's price risk is that the price
will increase.

- Risk factors (or simply, "factors") are the variables that affect an
asset's price. A model that shows how these factors affect an asset's
price is called an "asset pricing model."

- Given an asset pricing model, one can measure an asset's price risk
exposure to each factor, which is referred to as an asset's "beta factor."

- Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to changes in the
general level of interest rates. Credit spread duration is a measure of a
bond's price exposure to changes in the credit spread.

- Many derivative instruments are available for controlling the price
risk of an individual asset and a portfolio of assets.

- Reinvestment risk is the risk that when proceeds are received from an
investment, they will have to be reinvested at an interest rate that is less

than when the original investment was made.

- Inflation risk (also referred to as "purchasing power risk") is the risk
that the nominal return earned will be less than the inflation rate; that is,
inflation risk is the risk of earning a negative real return.

- An asset's liquidity risk is the risk that when an investor executes a
trade for that asset, prevailing market conditions will be such that the
cost will be higher and there will be a significant adverse impact on the
price at which the trade is executed.

- Foreign exchange risk (also referred to as "currency risk") is the risk
that the currency in which a cash flow is paid (i.e., the foreign currency)
will depreciate relative to the domestic currency.

- Funding risk, or financing risk, is the risk associated with obtaining
funds and includes leverage risk, funding liquidity risk, timing risk, and
fixed-floating financing risk.

- Leverage risk is the adverse financial impact resulting from the use of
leverage.

- The degree of leverage of a corporation can be measured by its debt
ratio (the ratio of the debt to total assets) or its debt-to-equity ratio.

- Funding liquidity is the ability of a borrower to settle its debt
- bligations immediately. The risk that an entity cannot do so is called
"funding liquidity risk."

- Timing risk is the risk associated with the timing of raising capital
resulting in a funding cost higher than expected at some future date
when the funds are needed.

- A funding risk associated with the decision as to whether to borrow
- n a fixed-rate or floating-rate basis is referred to as a "fixed-floating
financing risk."

- In general, the term "systemic risk" refers to the probability that an
entire system will collapse or fail. When applied to finance, it is
referred to as "systemic financial risk."

- Financial innovations can be classified in terms of the type of
financial instrument (market-broadening instruments, risk management
instruments, and arbitraging instruments and processes) and according

to more specific functions (price risk-transferring innovations, credit

risk-transferring instruments, liquidity-generating innovations, creditgenerating instruments, and equity-generating instruments).

Questions

1. In an article, Pablo A. Guerron-Quintana explains the difference between
risk and uncertainty as follows:

Consider the experiment of flipping a fair coin (Case A). In this experiment, the unknown is whether

the coin will land heads or tails. Because we are dealing with a fair coin, we know that the odds of

heads after each flip are 50–50. That is, if we were to flip the coin let's say 100 times, the coin would

land, on average, 50 times heads and 50 times tails. The crucial insight from this experiment is the

- bservation that we know exactly the odds of each of the possible events: 50 percent heads and 50
percent tails. Furthermore, we have this knowledge before starting the experiment.…

Now let's consider an alternative experiment (Case B). As before, we are interested in learning the

result of flipping a coin. The key difference is that we know the coin is no longer fair, but we do not

know the odds of obtaining heads. Furthermore, the coin is replaced by a new (and unfair) coin after

each flip. Under this scenario, the only thing we know is that the coin will land either heads or tails. If

we were thinking about flipping the coin 100 times, we could not (before we start the experiment) tell

how many times the coin will land on heads. [11]

a. Which of the two experiments is an example of Knightian uncertainty?

Explain why.

b. Which of the two experiments is an example of Knightian risk? Explain

why.

2. The following quote is from Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense
under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2006:

Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know,

there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known

unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown

unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know.

Discuss this quote in the context of risk and uncertainty.

3. The quote below is taken from a description of risks by and methods
for dealing with risks faced by a financial entity, Goldman Sachs. The
three blanks are intentional. In addition to liquidity risk, the quote
below discusses another form of risk. What is that risk?

The Goldman Sachs _________ plan sets out the plan of action we would use to fund business activity

in crisis situations and periods of market stress. The _________ plan outlines a list of potential risk

factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the

severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The _________ plan

also describes in detail the firm's potential responses if our assessments indicate that the firm has

entered a liquidity crisis, which include funding our potential cash and collateral needs as well as

utilizing secondary sources of liquidity.

4. Explain the risk management policy followed by an individual who
purchases a home insurance policy that has a large deductible (i.e., an
amount of loss that the homeowner absorbs before the insurance

company makes a payment).

5. The following is from the University of British Columbia Board of
Governors' Policy No. 125 regarding major capital projects:

The University manages risk on major capital projects through a variety of strategies incorporated into

its project planning, delivery and procurement processes. Risk management strategies include the

avoidance, reduction and transference of risk away from the University, as appropriate. However,

some types of risk cannot be fully or economically managed through these means and in those cases, it

is prudent and cost efficient to retain and self-insure against such risks.

The document then goes on to describe the establishment of funds for major

capital projects to protect against overruns "to manage risk in a prudent and

cost-efficient manner, including through the avoidance, reduction or

transference of risk away from the University, as appropriate" and to explain

how each fund is to be financed. Discuss the general elements of this risk

management policy.

6. The following excerpt is taken from various filings of KimberlyClark Corporation (manufacturer of well-known products, such as
Huggies, Kleenex, and Pull-Ups):

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers'

compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and

management's judgment of cost effective risk retention.

Describe this corporation's risk management policy.

7. Suppose that your car needs a major repair that will cost \$3,000. You
sign an agreement with the car repair shop to perform the services. The
repair shop must order the necessary parts and estimates that it will take

   - ne week for the parts to be acquired. The repair shop requires that you
provide an upfront payment of \$1,500 as a deposit before the parts are

   - rdered. What is the financial risk to which you are exposed?

8. "Because idiosyncratic risk cannot be diversified away, it is referred
to as systematic risk." Explain whether you agree or disagree with this

statement.

9. In a speech in 2009, Ben Bernanke, then chair of the Federal
Reserve, concluded:

In the wake of the ongoing financial crisis, governments have moved quickly to establish a wide range

- f programs to support financial market functioning and foster credit flows to businesses and
households. However, these necessary short-term steps must be accompanied by new policies to limit
the incidence and impact of systemic risk. [12]

a. What is meant by systemic risk?

b. Why does systemic risk impede the flow of credit available to businesses

and households?

c. Why is government intervention needed to reduce systemic risk rather

than relying solely on individual market participants to do so without

intervention?

10. The following excerpt is from a paper by Neil Adrian S. Cabiles of
the University of Bologna:

Bank engagement in securitization [re]lies on two rationales. One is that securitization provides the

bank with an additional funding source and the other is that it can be a risk management tool. [13]

a. What is securitization?

b. Why is asset securitization a risk management tool?

11. The following excerpt is from an article by Georges Dionne:

The creation of structured finance was mainly motivated by the transfer of credit risk, through the use

- f credit derivatives (e.g., CDSs) and banks' securitization of loans, to investors. For example, the
selling of bank loans to trusts serves to transfer banks' credit risk via structured products to various
groups of investors such as pension funds, industrial and service corporations, hedge funds or even

- ther banks. [14]

a. What is meant by "structured finance"?

b. Give two examples of applications of structured finance to risk

management other than securitization.

12. What is the relationship between systematic risk and common risk
factors?

13. Why is the duration of a bond a common risk factor?
14. a. What is credit spread risk?

b. Why might one expect that credit spread duration would be a quantitative

measure of credit spread risk?

15. Mr. Bennett wants to invest \$100,000 for the next 10 years with the
following investment strategy. The amount will be invested in a default

free U.S. government security that matures every month. Every time the

security matures, the investor will use the proceeds to invest in another

government security with one month to maturity. Suppose further that

   - ne-month government securities today pay an interest rate of 5%. In
Mr. Bennett's view, this investment strategy has little risk, because onemonth securities have no price risk if held to maturity and he can lock
in at least a 5% return over the next 10 years. Discuss this investment
strategy and the risks associated with it.

16. Ms. Callan, a citizen of the United States who resides in the
country, wants to invest in a U.K. government bond that matures in 10
years. The government bond in which she will invest pays interest once
a year in British pounds, and the principal repayment is also in British
pounds. The government bond she is considering pays 4%, and she
believes that interest rates over the next 20 years in the United
Kingdom will not fall below 4%. In the opinion of Ms. Callan, she will
be able to earn at a minimum a 4% return on her investment. What is

your opinion regarding the risks of realizing at least a 4% return?

17. In the early 1980s, when interest rates were at historic highs,
investment banking firms introduced a security backed by U.S.
government bonds that paid no annual interest (referred to as zerocoupon bonds) with all of the interest being paid at the bonds' maturity
date. The securities were given such names as TIGRS (Treasury Income
Growth Receipts, a Merrill Lynch product), CATS (Certificates of
Accrual on Treasuries, a Salomon Brothers product), and LIONS
(Lehman Investment Opportunity Notes, a Lehman Brothers product).

a. Why do you think securities with this feature were introduced at that

time?

b. Too often it was stated that these securities had no risk. What risks does

an investor face when purchasing these securities?

18. The following excerpt is from an article by Lucy Meakin and
David Goodman:

Germany is planning to auction its longest-maturity inflation-linked bonds to date, a sign that the

slowest pace of consumer-price increases in the euro region for more than four years isn't deterring

investors. [15]

a. What is an inflation-linked bond?

b. Why do you think that investors are not deterred from buying these bonds

despite low rates of inflation in recent years?

c. What is meant by a "credit rating"?

d. What commercial entities provide credit ratings?

e. What is an internal credit rating?

19. What is the purpose of a credit scoring model?
20. What financial market instruments can be used to control credit

risk?

21. a. What is meant by a "call provision" in a bond?

b. Why does a call provision in a bond increase reinvestment risk?

22. In 2006 and 2007, because of concerns about the South Korean
currency (the won) appreciating, export companies in that country
entered into a derivatives contract called a "knock-in, knock-out
contract." Basically, this was an agreement to hedge against an
appreciation of the won. Why would South Korean exporters want to
hedge against the won appreciating?

23. The following excerpt is from a 2010 article by Shah Gilani:

In today's multinational corporations, managing foreign-currency exposure has evolved into one of the

key responsibilities of the chief financial officer (CFO). Former Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)

CFO John Conners recently lamented that foreign-currency management is one of the most-difficult

and least-understood jobs in finance. If CFOs struggle with currency exposure, we're all in trouble. [16]

What can the CFO do to deal with foreign exchange risk?

24. The CFO of a corporation faces timing risk when raising funds, via
the issuance of either bonds or common stock. Explain why.

25. Two corporate treasurers are arguing about the cheapest form of
long-term debt financing: fixed-rate or floating rate. They ask for your

   - pinion. Provide it.

26. The CFO of a U.S. corporation is considering borrowing £500
million at a cost of 4% per year. The corporation will deploy the
proceeds received to expand its lines of business.

a. Explain what will happen to corporate earnings if the proceeds invested

from the funds raised can earn 7% per year.

b. Explain what will happen to corporate earnings if the proceeds invested

from the funds raised can earn 1% per year.

c. Based on your answers to (a) and (b), describe the advantages and

disadvantages of the use of financial leverage.

27. a. Banks are highly leveraged entities. Suppose that the debt ratio

   - f a bank is 92% (expressed as percentage). What does this mean?

b. If a bank has a debt ratio of 92%, what is the debt-to-equity ratio?

28. A security has been created by pooling loans to individuals who
will use the proceeds to purchase a home. The securities that are backed
by the pool of loans are called "mortgage-backed securities." If the
borrowers in the pool of loans have an impaired credit history (i.e., a
poor credit history), then the mortgage-backed securities created are
called "subprime mortgage-backed securities." Typically, each loan is
for 30 years. One of the major risks faced by an investor in this security
is credit risk. This risk is that the borrower will default on the loan,
resulting in the loss by investors of principal and interest. To assess this
risk, investors would have to forecast how many borrowers would
default each year over the next 30 years, as well as how much will be
recovered if the borrower defaults. The default and recoveries over the

next 30 years depends on a myriad of factors. Two obvious ones are the

state of the economy and conditions in the housing market. So

forecasting what would be received by an investor over the next 30

years in order to value subprime mortgage-backed securities would

require forecasting the state of the economy and the conditions in the

housing market. Adding to this problem, the history of defaults of

borrowers classified as subprime is limited, because these are relatively

new types of loans. Despite the complexities of making the required

forecasts and the limited information about default, the risks associated

with subprime mortgage-backed securities were calculated by market

participants and relied on when assessing the risks of institutional

portfolios that contained them and of the trading desks of banks that

held them in inventory.

Why does this type of risk modeling fall into the category of Knight's

unmeasurable uncertainty and Keynes's irreducible uncertainty?

1. Frank Knight, _Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit_ (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1921).
2. John Maynard Keynes, _Treatise on Probability_ (New York: Macmillan & Co., 1921).
3. See Nassim N. Taleb, _The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable_, 2nd ed. (New York:

_Chance in Life and in the Markets_ (New York: Random House, 2005).

4. Although in later chapters we discuss "capital" for financial institutions (such as banks and
insurance companies), the term is sometimes confused with the term "physical capital," which is used
in the production of goods and services by a manufacturing firm (e.g., for machinery, equipment,
facilities). Simply put, when referring to the "capital" of a financial institution, the term means the
difference between the institution's assets and liabilities. Sounds simple to figure out, except that (as
discussed in chapter 7) regulators of financial institutions have different ways in which they measure
capital for regulatory purposes.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the many key properties of financial assets: moneyness, divisibility
and denomination, reversibility, cash flow, term to maturity,
convertibility, currency, liquidity, return predictability or risk,
complexity, and tax status;

   - the components of an asset's discount rate or required rate of return;
   - what is meant by a basis point;
   - how the discount rate is structured to encompass the components of
an asset's risk;

   - the principles of valuing complex financial assets;
   - the inverse relationship between an asset's price and its discount rate;
   - the principles that reveal how the properties of an asset affect its
value, either through the discount rate or through its expected cash
flow;

   - what factors affect the price sensitivity of a financial asset to changes
in interest rates; and

   - what duration means, and how it is related to the price sensitivity of
an asset to a change in interest rates.

Financial assets have certain properties that determine or influence their

attractiveness to different classes of investors and issuers. This chapter

introduces these properties in preparation for a more detailed exposition in

later chapters. The chapter also provides the basic principles of the valuation

- r pricing of financial assets and illustrates how several of the properties of
financial assets affect their value.

```
Properties of Financial Assets

```

The 11 properties of financial assets are (1) moneyness, (2) divisibility and

denomination, (3) reversibility, (4) cash flow, (5) term to maturity, (6)

convertibility, (7) currency, (8) liquidity, (9) return predictability, (10)

complexity, and (11) tax status. [1]

```
Moneyness

```

Some financial assets are used as a medium of exchange or in settlement of

transactions. These assets are called **money** . In the United States, money

consists of currency and all forms of deposits that permit check writing.

Other assets, although not money, are very close to money in that they can

be transformed into money at little cost, delay, or risk. They are referred to

as **near money** . In the case of the United States, these include time and

savings deposits and a security issued by the U.S. government called a

"Treasury bill." [2] Moneyness is clearly a desirable property for investors.

```
Divisibility and Denomination

```

**Divisibility** relates to the minimum size in which a financial asset can be
liquidated and exchanged for money. The smaller the size, the more the
financial asset is divisible. A financial asset (such as a deposit) is typically
infinitely divisible (down to the penny), but other financial assets have
varying degrees of divisibility depending on their denomination, which is the
dollar value of the amount that each unit of the asset will pay at maturity.
Thus, many bonds come in \$1,000 denominations, commercial paper in
\$25,000 units, [3] and certain types of certificates of deposit in \$100,000 or
more. In general, divisibility is desirable for investors but not for borrowers.

```
Reversibility

```

**Reversibility** refers to the cost of investing in a financial asset and then
getting out of it and back into cash again. Consequently, reversibility is also
referred to as **turnaround cost** - r _round-trip cost_ .

A financial asset (such as a deposit at a bank) is obviously highly

reversible, because usually there is no charge for adding to or withdrawing

from it. Other transactions costs may be unavoidable, but these are small.

For financial assets traded in organized markets or with **market makers**

(discussed in chapter 18), the most relevant component of round-trip cost is

the so-called **bid-ask spread**, to which might be added commissions and the

time and cost, if any, of delivering the asset. The spread charged by a market

maker varies sharply from one financial asset to another, reflecting primarily

the amount of risk the market maker is assuming by "making" a market.

This market-making risk, which is discussed in more detail in chapter 18,

can be related to two main forces. One is the variability of the price as

measured, say, by some measure of dispersion of the relative price over time.

The greater the variability is, the greater the probability of the market maker

incurring a loss in excess of a stated bound between the time of buying and

that of reselling the financial asset. The variability of prices differs widely

across financial assets. For example, Treasury bills have a very stable price

for the reason explained at the end of this chapter, but a speculative stock

will exhibit much larger short-run variations.

The second determining factor of the bid-ask spread charged by a market

maker is what is commonly referred to as the **thickness of the market** :

essentially, the prevailing rate at which buying and selling orders reach the

market maker (that is, the frequency of transactions). A **thin market** is one

that has few trades on a regular or continuing basis. Clearly, the greater the

frequency of order flows, the shorter the time that the security will have to

be held in the market maker's inventory, and hence the smaller the

probability of an unfavorable price movement while held.

Thickness, too, varies from market to market. A three-month U.S.

Treasury bill is easily the thickest market in the world. In contrast, trading in

stock of small companies is not thick but thin. Because Treasury bills

dominate other instruments both in price stability and thickness, their bidask spread tends to be the smallest in the market. A low turnaround cost is

clearly a desirable property of a financial asset, and as a result, thickness

itself is a valuable property. This explains the potential advantage of larger

- ver smaller markets (economies of scale), along with a market's tendency
to standardize the instruments offered to the public.

```
Cash Flow

```

The return that an investor will realize by holding a financial asset depends

- n all the cash distributions that the financial asset will pay its owners; this
includes dividends on shares and coupon payments on bonds. The return also
considers the repayment of principal for a debt security and the expected sale
price of a stock. When computing the expected return, noncash payments—
such as stock dividends and options to purchase additional stock, or the
distribution of other securities—must also be accounted for.

In a world of nonnegligible inflation, it is also important to distinguish

between nominal expected return and real expected return. The expected

return that we described above is the nominal expected return. That is, it

considers the dollars that are expected to be received but does not adjust

those dollars to take into consideration changes in their purchasing power.

The net real expected return is the nominal expected return after adjustment

for the loss of purchasing power of the financial asset as a result of

anticipated inflation. For example, if the nominal expected return for a oneyear investment of \$1,000 is 6%, then at the end of one year, the investor

expects to realize \$1,060, consisting of interest of \$60 and the repayment of

the \$1,000 investment. However, if the inflation rate over the same period of

time is 4%, then the purchasing power of \$1,060 is only $1,019.23 ($1,060

divided by 1.04). Thus, the return in terms of purchasing power, or the real

return, is 1.923%. In general, the expected real return can be approximated

by subtracting the expected inflation rate from the expected nominal return.

In our example, it is approximately 2% (6% minus 4%).

```
Term to Maturity

```

**Term to maturity** is the length of the period until the date at which the
instrument is scheduled to make its final payment or the owner is entitled to
demand liquidation. Instruments for which the creditor can ask for
repayment at any time, such as checking accounts and many savings
accounts, are called "demand instruments." Maturity is an important
characteristic of financial assets (such as bonds) and can range from one day
to more than a half of a century. Bonds with no maturity date, called
"perpetual bonds," have been issued to lock-in law interest rates. In the
United Kingdom, there is one well-known type of bond issued by the Bank

- f England called a "consul." Many other instruments, including equities,
have no maturity and are thus a form of perpetual instrument.

Note that even a financial asset with a stated maturity might terminate

before its stated maturity. This may occur for several reasons, including

bankruptcy or reorganization, or because of **call provisions** entitling the

debtor to repay in advance, usually at some penalty and only after a number

- f years from the time of issuance. Typically, perpetual bonds have a call

provision, allowing the issuer to call the bond five years after issuance.

Sometimes the investor may have the privilege of asking for early

repayment. This feature is called a **put option** . Some assets have maturities

that may be increased or extended at the discretion of the issuer or the

investor. For example, the French government issues a six-year _obligation_

_renouvelable du Trésor_, which allows the investor, after the end of the third

year, to switch into a new six-year debt. Similar bonds are issued by the

British government. All these features regarding maturity are discussed in

later chapters.

```
Convertibility

```

As the preceding discussion shows, an important property of some assets is

that they are **convertible** into other assets. In some cases, the conversion

takes place within one class of assets, as when a bond is converted into

another bond. In other situations, the conversion spans classes. For example,

a corporate convertible bond is a bond that the bondholder can change into

equity shares. Preferred stock may be convertible into common stock. It is

important to note that the timing, costs, and conditions for conversion are

clearly spelled out in the legal descriptions of the convertible security at the

time it is issued.

```
Currency

```

We have noted throughout our discussion that the global financial system has

become increasingly integrated. In light of the freely floating and often

volatile exchange rates among the major currencies, [4] this fact gives added

importance to the currency in which the financial asset will make cash flow

payments. Most financial assets are denominated in one currency, such as

U.S. dollars or yen or euros, and investors must choose among them with

volatile exchange rates in mind.

Some issuers, responding to investors' wishes to reduce **currency** risk,

have issued _dual-currency securities_ . For example, some Eurobonds [5] pay

interest in one currency but principal or redemption value in a second. U.S.

dollars and yen are commonly paired in these cases. Furthermore, some

Eurobonds carry a currency option that allows the investor to specify that

payments of either interest or principal be made in either one of two major

currencies.

```
Liquidity

```

Liquidity is an important and widely used notion, although at present no

universally accepted definition of liquidity exists. A useful way to think of

liquidity and illiquidity, proposed by Professor James Tobin, [6] is in terms of

how much sellers stand to lose if they wish to sell immediately as opposed to

engaging in a costly and time-consuming search.

An example of a quite illiquid financial asset is the stock of a small

corporation or the bond issued by a small school district. The market for

such a security is extremely thin, and one must search for one of a very few

suitable buyers. Less suitable buyers, including speculators and market

makers, may be located more promptly, but they will have to be enticed to

invest in the illiquid financial asset by an appropriate discount in price.

For many other financial assets, liquidity is determined by contractual

arrangements. For example, ordinary deposits are perfectly liquid, because

the bank has a contractual obligation to convert them at par on demand. In

contrast, financial contracts representing a claim on a private pension fund

may be regarded as totally illiquid, because they can be cashed only at

retirement.

Liquidity may depend not only on the financial asset but also on the

quantity one wishes to sell (or buy). Although a small quantity may be quite

liquid, a large lot may run into illiquidity problems. Note that liquidity is

again closely related to whether a market is thick or thin. Thinness always

has the effect of increasing the turnaround cost, even of a liquid financial

asset. But beyond some point, thinness becomes an obstacle to the formation

- f a market, and it has a direct effect on the illiquidity of the financial asset.

```
Return Predictability

```

**Return predictability** is a basic property of financial assets, in that it is a
major determinant of their value. Assuming investors are risk averse, the
riskiness of an asset can be equated with the uncertainty or unpredictability

- f its return. We will see in chapter 12 how the unpredictability of future
returns can be measured and how it is related to the variability of past

returns. But whatever measure of volatility is used, [7] it is obvious that

volatility varies greatly across financial assets. There are several reasons for

this variability.

First, as illustrated later in this chapter, the value of a financial asset

depends on the cash flow expected and on the interest rate used to discount

this cash flow. Hence, volatility will be a consequence of the uncertainty

about future interest rates and future cash flow. The future cash flow may be

contractual, in which case the sole source of its uncertainty is the reliability

- f the debtor with regard to fulfilling the obligation. The cash flow may be
in the nature of a residual equity claim, as is the case for the payments
generated by the equity of a corporation. The cash flows from U.S.
government securities are the only cash flows generally regarded as
altogether riskless. Corporate debt and corporate stock cash flows are
generally riskier than cash flows of U.S. government securities. Corporate
equities represent a wide range of risk, from public utilities to highly
speculative issues.

As for a change in interest rates, it will in principle affect all prices in the

- pposite direction, but the effect is much larger in the case of the price of a
financial asset with a long maturity than one with a short remaining life, as
illustrated later in this chapter. Thus, on this account also, short-term U.S.
government securities, such as Treasury bills, tend to be the safest assets,
except for cash (if properly insured). For individual stocks, the interest effect
is generally swamped by cash flow uncertainty, although movements in
interest rates have the characteristic of affecting all stocks in the same
direction, whereas a change in expected cash flow is largely dependent on a
firm's particular financial situation. In general, uncertainty about returns and
future prices can be expected to increase as the investment horizon
lengthens.

What has been said so far relates to the predictability of nominal returns,

although the relevant measure, of course, is real returns—returns corrected

for gains or losses of purchasing power attributable to inflation. Of course, if

inflation is absent or small, the determinants of real and nominal uncertainty

and risk coincide. But in the presence of highly unpredictable inflation

(which is usually the case with high inflation), real returns may be

drastically harder to predict than nominal returns.

```
Complexity

```

Some financial assets are complex in the sense that they are actually

combinations of two or more simpler assets. To find the true value of such

an asset, one must break it down into its component parts and price each

separately. The sum of those prices is the value of the complex asset. A good

example of a complex asset is the **callable bond**, that is, a bond whose issuer

is entitled to repay the debt prior to the maturity date. When investors buy

such a bond, they in effect buy a bond and sell to the issuer an option that

allows the issuer to redeem the bond at a set price prior to the issue's

scheduled maturity. Therefore, the correct or true price of a callable bond is

equal to the price of a similar noncallable bond less the value of the issuer's

right to retire the bond early.

A complex asset can be viewed as a bundle or package of cash flows and

- ptions belonging to either the issuer or the holder, or both. Other examples
- f a complex asset include a convertible bond, a bond that has payments that
can be made in a different currency at the option of the bondholder, and a
bond that can be sold back to the issuer at a fixed price (that is, a **putable**
**bond** ).

In some cases, the degree of complexity is high: Many convertible bonds

are also callable, and some bonds give their issuers the right either to extend

the asset's maturity or to redeem it early. Also, some Japanese firms have

issued bonds that are convertible into Japanese stock (denominated in yen, of

course) but that are sold for, and make coupon and principal payments in,

another currency, such as U.S. dollars.

```
Tax Status

```

An important feature of any asset is its **tax status** . Governmental regulations

for taxing the income from the ownership or sale of financial assets vary

widely, if not wildly. Tax rates differ from year to year, from country to

country, and even among regional and local governments (states and

municipalities in the United States) within a country. Moreover, tax rates

may differ across financial assets, depending on the type of issuer, the length

- f time the asset is held, the nature of the owner, and so on. For example, in
the United States, pension funds are exempt from income taxes (see chapter
4 for more details), and coupon payments on municipal bonds are generally
free of taxation by the federal government (see chapter 21).

```
Principles of Pricing Financial Assets

```

The fundamental principle of finance is that the true or correct price of an

asset equals the **present value** - f all cash flows that the owner of the asset

expects to receive during its life. In general, the correct price for a financial

asset can be expressed as follows:

where

_P_ = the price of the financial asset,

_CFt_ = the cash flow in year _t_ ( _t_ = 1, … …, _N_ ),

_N_ = maturity of the financial asset, and

_r_

= appropriate discount rate.

```
The Appropriate Discount Rate

```

The appropriate **discount rate**, _r_, is the return that the market or the

consensus of investors requires on the asset. A convenient (but approximate)

expression for the appropriate discount rate is:

_r_ = _RR_ + _IP_ + _DP_ + _MP_ + _LP_ + _EP_,

where

_RR_ = the real rate of interest, which is the reward for not consuming

and for lending to other users;

_IP_ = the inflation premium, which is the compensation for the expected

decline in the purchasing power of the money lent to borrowers;

_DP_ = the default risk premium, which is the reward for taking on the

risk of default in the case of a loan (or bond) or the risk of loss of

principal for other assets;

_MP_ = the maturity premium, which is the compensation for lending

money for long periods of time;

_LP_ = the liquidity premium, which is the reward for investing in an

asset that may not be readily converted to cash at a fair market value;

and

_EP_ = the exchange-rate risk premium, which is the reward for investing

in an asset that is not denominated in the investor's home currency.

Obviously, the price of an asset is inversely related to its discount rate: If the

discount rate rises, the price falls; and if the rate declines, the price increases.

```
Illustration

```

Let us construct a simple example to illustrate the pricing of a financial

asset. We can then use the hypothetical financial asset to illustrate some of

the properties explained earlier in this chapter.

Suppose a bond has a maturity of four years and pays annual interest of

\$50 at the end of each year plus a principal of \$1,000 at the conclusion of the

fourth year. Because this bond pays $50 per $1,000 of principal, the periodic

coupon rate is 5%. This rate is commonly and simply referred to as the

**coupon rate** . Thus, using the previous notation, we have

_N_ = 4 _CF_ 1 = $50 _CF_ 2 = $50 _CF_ 3 = $50 _CFN_ = $1,050.

Furthermore, assume that the market thinks the real rate is 2.5%, the

inflation premium is 3%, the bond's default risk justifies a premium of 2%,

the maturity premium is 0.5%, and the liquidity premium is 1%. Because the

cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars, the foreign-exchange rate

premium is zero. That is,

_RR_ = 2.5%, _IP_ = 3.0%, _DP_ = 2.0%, _MP_ = 0.5%, _LP_ = 1.0%, _EP_ = 0%.

Thus, we have the following value for the discount rate:

_r_ = 2.5% + 3.0% + 2.0% + 0.5% + 1.0% + 0% = 9.0%, or 0.09.

Using the formula for price, the price of this bond is

```
Price and Asset Properties

```

We can use this hypothetical financial asset to illustrate the effect of some of

the properties of financial assets on price or asset value. First, it should be

clear that the price of a financial asset changes as the appropriate discount

rate, _r_, changes. More specifically, the price changes in the opposite

direction to the change in the appropriate discount rate. An illustration of

this principle appears in table 11.1, which shows the price of our

hypothetical financial asset for various discount rates.

```

10 841.51

11 813.85

12 787.39

13 762.04

14 737.77

Let's look at how reversibility affects an asset's value. Suppose a

**broker's commission** - f \$35 is imposed by brokers to buy or sell the bond.

The price of the four-year bond is then

Notice that the initial commission of \$35 is subtracted on an undiscounted

basis, because that payment is made at the time of purchase.

Suppose also that a government entity imposes a transfer tax of \$20 on

each transaction. Because this rise in the cost of reversing an investment

diminishes its reversibility to some extent, the present value of all cash flows

associated with owning the bond now looks like:

The change in price is significant and demonstrates why financial

markets adjust so sharply (and rapidly) when governments impose

restrictions on, or raise the cost of, capital market transactions.

To see how default risk affects the price of an asset, assume that, right

before you bought the bond, a news story convinced investors that this bond

is less risky than they had thought. So, the default risk premium falls from

2% to 1%, and the appropriate discount rate thus declines from 9% to 8%.

Ignoring commissions and transfer fees, table 11.1 shows that the price

would increase from $870.41 to $900.64.

What about liquidity? Suppose immediately after the purchase of this

bond, factors in the market for this bond cause its liquidity to decline. An

investor buying this asset would plan for such a possibility by raising the

liquidity premium. Assume that the liquidity premium increases from 1% to

3%. The appropriate discount rate then increases from 9% to 11%. Ignoring

the commission and the transfer fee, table 11.1 shows that the price would be

\$813.85. The fall in price, from the original $870.41 to $813.85, shows how

important liquidity can be.

Now, let's tackle the notion of complexity by assuming that the bond is

convertible into a fixed number of shares of common stock of the company

that issued the bond. The price of our four-year bond would then be greater

than \$870.41 by an amount equal to the value that the market assigns to the

right to convert the bond into common stock. For example, suppose we

- bserve that the price of our hypothetical bond with the conversion privilege
is \$1,000.41. This means that the conversion privilege is valued by the
market at \$130.

The unresolved question is whether \$130 is a fair value for this

conversion privilege. Valuation techniques to determine the fair value of any

type of option (such as a conversion privilege) are available. It is sufficient

to understand why a knowledge of how to value an option is important.

Because many financial assets have options embedded in them, failure to

assess the options properly may lead to the mispricing of financial assets.

Now, let's turn our attention to currency. Suppose that this bond was

issued by a German firm and that all payments are in euros. The cash flow in

U.S. dollars that a U.S. investor will receive is uncertain, because the dollareuro exchange rate will fluctuate over the four years. Suppose that the

market assigns an exchange premium of 3%. As a result, the appropriate

discount rate increases from 9% to 12%, and the price would be \$787.39

(see table 11.1). To continue with the effect of currency risk, suppose that

immediately after the purchase of this bond, the market expects that the

exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro will become more

volatile. The market will adjust for this volatility by increasing the foreign

currency risk premium, which, in turn, increases the appropriate discount

rate and decreases the price.

It is easy to illustrate the impact of taxes. Suppose that our bond is

granted a favorable tax treatment such that the interest and any capital gain

from this bond would not be taxed. Suppose that the marginal tax rate on

- otherwise equivalent taxable bonds is 33.33%, and the appropriate discount
rate is 9%. Then the after-tax discount rate would be approximately 6%, as
shown below:

Pretax discount rate × (1 − marginal tax rate) = 0.09 × (1 − 0.3333) = 6%.

Because our hypothetical bond is free of taxes, the appropriate discount

rate would be adjusted to compensate for this feature. The discount rate that

would be used is 6%, because it is the equivalent of a 9% discount rate and a

33.33% marginal tax rate. From table 11.1, we see that the price of the bond

would be \$965.35.

Continuing with the importance of tax features to the price of a financial

asset, suppose that immediately after the purchase of this bond, the market

comes to expect that the U.S. Congress will raise the marginal tax rate. This

expectation would increase the value of the tax-exempt feature by decreasing

the discount rate based on the anticipated rise in the marginal tax rate. The

- pposite would occur if the market came to expect that the U.S. Congress
would lower the marginal tax rate.

Although we have used a single discount rate to discount each cash flow,

theoretical reasons suggest that this is inappropriate. Specifically, in chapter

18, we will look at the relationship between a bond's maturity and yield. In

addition, a financial asset should be viewed as a package of cash flows. Each

cash flow should be treated as if it were an individual asset with only one

cash flow, and that cash flow has its own discount rate that depends on when

it will be received. Consequently, a more general formula for pricing a

financial asset is

where _rt_ is the discount rate appropriate for period _t_ .

```
Price Volatility of Financial Assets

```

As table 11.1 makes clear, a fundamental pricing principle is that a financial

asset's price changes in the opposite direction of the change in the required

rate of return. We refer to the required rate of return as the **required yield** .

This principle follows from the fact that the price of a financial asset is equal

to the present value of its cash flow. An increase (decrease) in the yield

required by investors decreases (increases) the present value of the cash flow

and, therefore, the financial asset's price.

The price sensitivity of a financial asset to a change in the required yield

will not be the same for all assets. For example, an increase in the required

yield of one percentage point may result in a decline in one asset's price of

20%, but only of 3% for another. In this section, we will see how the

characteristics of a financial asset and the level of interest rates affect the

price responsiveness of a financial asset to a change in the required yield.

We also present a measure that can be used to gauge the approximate price

sensitivity of a financial asset to changes in the required yield.

Note that the analysis in this section applies fully and directly to bonds

and other financial assets that have known expected cash flows and known

expected maturities. An analysis of the price sensitivity of other major

financial assets, such as preferred stock and common stock (which are

perpetuals and have uncertain cash flows), must be postponed to a later

chapter.

In our discussion, we will refer to changes in the required yield. It is

convenient to measure a change in yield in terms of what market participants

refer to as a **basis point** rather than in terms of a percentage change. One

basis point is defined as 0.0001, or equivalently, 0.01%. Therefore, 100 basis

points is equal to one percentage point, and a yield change from 9% to 10%

represents a 100 basis point change in yield. A yield change from 7% to

7.5% is a 50 basis point change, and a yield change from 6% to 8.35% is a

235 basis point change in yield.

```
The Effect of Maturity

```

An asset's maturity is a factor that affects its price sensitivity to a change in

yield. In fact, a bond's price sensitivity to a change in the discount rate is

positively related to the bond's maturity. Consider the case of two bonds that

have the same coupon rate and the same required yield but different

maturities. If the required rate were to change, the price sensitivity of the

bond with the longer maturity would be greater than that of the bond with

the shorter maturity.

An illustration of this link between maturity and price change appears in

table 11.2, which shows the price of a bond that pays \$50 annually and

\$1,000 at maturity—a 5% coupon rate—for various maturities and discount

rates. Table 11.3, which is based on table 11.2, shows the differences across

maturities in a bond's dollar price decline and percentage price decline for an

increase in the discount rate of 100 basis points. For example, if the discount

rate rises from 9% to 10%, the price of a four-year bond falls from \$870.41

to \$841.51, which represents a price decline of \$28.90 and a percentage

price decline of 3.32%. In contrast, a similar rise in the discount rate causes

the price of a 20-year bond to fall considerably more, from \$634.86 to

\$574.32, which represents a price decline of \$60.54 and a percentage price

decline of 9.54%.

From 13 to 14 - 3.18 - 6.25 - 7.41 - 7.79

```
The Effect of the Coupon Rate

```

A bond's coupon rate also affects its price sensitivity. More specifically, for

two bonds with the same maturity and required yield, the lower the coupon

rate is, the greater the price responsiveness will be for a given change in the

required yield.

To illustrate this, consider a 5% coupon bond and a 10% coupon bond,

each of which has a maturity of 15 years and a principal of \$1,000. If the

required yield for both bonds is 9%, the price of the 5% coupon bond would

be \$677.57, and the price of the 10% coupon bond would be \$1,080.61. If

the required yield increases by 100 basis points, from 9% to 10%, the price

- f the 5% coupon bond would fall to \$619.70, whereas the price of the 10%
coupon bond would fall to \$1,000. Thus, the 5% coupon bond's price
declines by \$57.87 or 8.5% ($57.87/$677.57), and the 10% coupon bond’s
price declines by \$80.61 or by 7.5% ($80.61/$1,080.61). Although the dollar
price change is greater for the higher-coupon bond, the percentage price
change is less.

In later chapters, we will discuss a special type of bond, one with no

coupon rate. This is called a **zero-coupon bond** . The investor who purchases

a zero-coupon bond receives no periodic interest payment. Instead, the

investor purchases the bond at a price below its principal and receives the

principal at the maturity date. The difference between the principal and the

price at which the zero-coupon bond is purchased represents interest earned

by the investor over the bond's life. For example, consider a zero-coupon

bond with a principal of \$1,000 and a maturity of 15 years. If the required

yield is 9%, then the price of this bond would be \$274.54. [8] The difference

between the principal of \$1,000 and the price of \$274.54 is the interest that

the investor realizes at the maturity date.

A zero-coupon bond will have greater price sensitivity than a bond with a

coupon rate selling at the same required yield and with the same maturity.

For example, consider once again the 15-year zero-coupon bond. If the

required yield increases from 9% to 10%, the price of this bond would fall to

\$239.39, a percentage price decline of 12.8% ($35.15/$274.54). This

percentage change is greater than the declines in price for the 15-year

maturity 5% coupon and 15-year 10% coupon bonds.

```
The Effect of the Level of Yields

```

Tables 11.2 and 11.3 also bring out another interesting property about asset

prices. Notice that, for a given maturity, the dollar price change and the

percentage price change are higher for the lower initial discount rates than

for the higher initial discount rates. For example, consider the 15-year bond

when the discount rate is 5%. The price of the bond falls from \$1,000 to

\$902.88 when the discount rate increases from 5% to 6%, a price decline of

\$97.20 and a percentage price decline of 9.72%. In contrast, a rise in the

discount rate of 100 basis points from 13% to 14% reduces the same bond’s

price by \$35.81 (from $483.01 to $447.20) and by the percentage of 7.41%.

The implication is that the lower the level of yields is, the greater the

effect a change in interest rates will have on the price of a financial asset.

```
Measuring Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Changes: Duration

```

From our discussion thus far, we see that three factors affect the price

sensitivity of an asset to changes in interest rates: the maturity, the coupon

rate, and the level of interest rates. When managing the price sensitivity of a

portfolio, market participants seek a measure of the sensitivity of assets to

interest rate changes that encompasses all three factors.

A useful way to approximate an asset's price sensitivity to interest rate

changes is to examine how the price changes if the yield changes by a small

number of basis points. To do this, we use the following notation:

_∆y_ = change in yield (in decimal),

_P_

0 = initial price of the asset,

_P_  - = asset's price if the yield is decreased by ∆ _y_, and

_P_ + = asset's price if the yield is increased by ∆ _y_ .

Then, for a small decrease in yield, the percentage price change is

The percentage price change per basis point change is found by dividing

the percentage price change by the number of basis points (∆ _y_ times 100).

That is,

Similarly, the percentage price change per basis point increase in yield is

The percentage price change for an increase and decrease in interest rates

will not be the same. Consequently, the average percentage price change per

basis point change in yield can be calculated. This is done as follows:

- r equivalently,

The approximate percentage price change for a 100-basis-point change in

yield is found by multiplying the previous formula by 100:

For example, the price of a 5% coupon bond with a principal of \$1,000

and a maturity of 15 years is \$677.57. If the yield is increased by 50 basis

points from 9% to 9.5%, the price would be \$647.73. If the yield is

decreased by 50 basis points from 9% to 8.5%, the price would be \$709.35.

Thus, we have the following values:

∆ _y_ = 0.005,

_P_ 0 = \$677.57,

_P_  - = \$709.35, and

_P_ + = \$647.73.

The application of the foregoing formula provides this number:

This measure of price sensitivity is popularly referred to as **duration**  - a

concept we introduced in chapter 6 when discussing the interest rate risk of a

depository institution. Table 11.4 shows how the duration is determined for a

5% coupon bond with different maturities when the interest rate is initially at

9%.

```
Table 11.4

```

Determination of duration for a 5% coupon bond with a principal of \$1,000 and an initial required

yield of 9%.

Table 11.5 shows the duration for three coupon bonds with different

maturities, assuming different initial yields. As can be seen from this table,

the relative magnitude of duration is consistent with the properties described

earlier. Specifically, (1) for bonds with the same coupon rate and the same

yield, the longer the maturity is, the greater the duration will be; (2) for

bonds with the same maturity and at the same yield, the lower the coupon

rate is, the greater the duration will be; and (3) the lower the initial yield is,

the greater the duration will be for a given bond. Thus, duration picks up the

effect of all three factors: maturity, coupon rate, and initial level of yield.

```
Table 11.5

```

Duration for various bonds by maturity, coupon rate, and yield level.

Duration is related to the price sensitivity as follows:

Approximate percentage change in a financial asset's price = −Duration ×

(Yield change in decimal form) × 100.

For example, suppose that the required yield on the 5% coupon, 15-year

bond increases from 9% to 10% (0.01 in decimal form). Then, because this

bond's duration is 9.09:

Approximate percentage change in price = −9.09 × (0.01) × 100 = −9.09%.

We showed earlier that the actual percentage change in price if the

required yield increases from 9% to 10% would be a fall of 8.5%. Thus,

duration is a close approximation of the percentage price change. The

approximation is better for smaller changes in the required yield. For

example, if the required yield changes by 20 basis points (0.002 in decimal

form) from 9% to 9.20% rather than 100 basis points, then based on

duration, the approximate percentage change in price would be −1.82%. The

actual price if the required yield increased by 20 basis points is \$665.41, a

decline of \$12.16 from the price of \$677.57 at 9%. The actual percentage

price change is therefore −1.79%(−$12.16/$677.57). Duration does an

excellent job of approximating the percentage price change in this case.

In general, one can interpret duration as follows: _the approximate_

_percentage change in price for a 100-basis-point change in interest rates_

_around the prevailing yield_ . Duration does a good job of approximating the

price change for a small change in yield (on the order of 50 basis points in

either direction). The larger the yield change is, the poorer will be the

approximation that duration provides.

Although we have developed duration in the context of bonds, note that

the basic principle applies equally to other financial assets. For example,

consider a financial asset whose cash flow is as follows:

Year Cash Flow

1 \$30

2 \$75

3 \$120

4 \$140

5 \$200

6 \$250

7 \$300

Suppose that the appropriate discount rate is 7%. Then the price of this

financial asset would be \$794.31. If the yield were decreased by 50 basis

points to 6.5%, the price would be \$812.82. If the yield were increased by 50

basis points to 7.5%, the price would be \$776.36. Thus, for this financial

asset, we know that

_∆y_ = 0.005,

_P_ 0 = \$794.31,

_P_  - = \$812.82, and

_P_ + = \$776.36.

The duration is then 4.59, calculated as follows:

Although we have focused on the price sensitivity of individual financial

assets to changes in interest rates, we can extend the principle to a portfolio

- f financial assets. The duration of a portfolio of assets is simply the
weighted average of the duration of the individual assets. The weight used
for each asset is its market value in the portfolio.

Moreover, the principle can be extended to a liability stream. A liability

can be viewed as a financial asset with a negative cash flow. The present

value of the cash outlays is equal to the value or price of the liability stream.

When interest rates change, the value of the liability stream changes. A

duration of a liability stream can be calculated in the same way as the

duration of a financial asset.

```
Importance of Measuring Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Changes

```

The importance of being able to measure the sensitivity of an individual

asset, a portfolio of assets, and a liability cannot be overemphasized. To

control interest rate risk, it is necessary to be able to measure it. An investor

with a portfolio of assets wants to be able to measure her exposure to interest

rate changes in order to assess whether the exposure is acceptable. If it is

not, she can alter the exposure. Various instruments that we describe later in

this book provide a means for doing so. Financial institutions manage assets

against liabilities. The interest rate risk exposure of a financial institution is

the difference between the duration of its assets and the duration of its

liabilities.

From our discussion, it may seem simple to calculate the duration of an

asset. Unfortunately, this is not the case, because for most assets, the cash

flow can change when interest rates change. In our illustrations, we have

assumed that when interest rates change, the cash flows are unchanged.

However, as we describe the various financial instruments in later chapters,

we will see that as interest rates change, either the issuer or the investor can

alter the cash flow. Consequently, if a change in the cash flow is not

considered when interest rates change, the duration calculation can be

misleading.

When a duration is calculated under the assumption that the cash flows

do not change when interest rates change, the resulting duration is called

**modified duration** . In contrast, a duration calculated assuming that the cash

flow changes when interest rates change is called **effective duration** . For

some assets, the difference between modified duration and effective duration

can be quite dramatic. For example, with some of the more complex

financial instruments discussed later in this book, the modified duration

could be four, whereas the effective duration could be 25! In this case, an

investor might believe that the price of the asset will change by

approximately 4% for a 100 basis point change in interest rates (modified

duration) when, in fact, it would change by approximately 25% for a 100basis-point change in interest rates (effective duration).

```
Macaulay Duration

```

The term "duration" was first used in 1938 by Frederick Macaulay as a

measure of the weighted average time to maturity of a bond. [9] It can be

shown that the measure Macaulay developed is related to the price

sensitivity of a bond to interest rate changes. Unfortunately, too many

market participants interpret duration as some measure of average life

instead of a measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes. This

misinterpretation has been a key factor in several financial blunders. For

example, for some complex financial assets, the effective duration is greater

than the **Macaulay duration** . Market participants who interpret duration as

a measure of the average life of an asset find this difficult to believe.

Consequently, when you hear the term "duration" used, interpret it as a

measure of price sensitivity to rate changes, not some measure of the asset's

average life. In addition, understand what type of duration measure is being

used, effective duration or modified duration. Effective duration is the

appropriate measure. Finally, if someone you know thinks that Macaulay

duration means something for managing a portfolio or the asset/liability

position of a financial institution, photocopy this page and tell them to

review this discussion!

Key Points

```

- A financial asset has many properties, and each affects the asset's value in
a distinctive and important way.

   - Some properties are intrinsic to the asset, such as its maturity or
promised cash flow.

   - Other properties are features of the market for the asset, such as the
costs of trading the asset.

   - Still other properties reflect decisions by government about the

asset's tax status.

   - A complex asset is one that provides options for the issuer or the
investor, or both, and so represents a combination of simpler assets.

   - An asset's price is the present value of its expected cash flows,
discounted at an appropriate rate.

   - The appropriate discount rate for an asset's cash flows depends on the
properties of the asset.

   - The appropriate discount rate can often be approximated as the sum
   - f rewards for the various risks an asset poses to its buyer.
   - The price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a change in
its discount rate.

   - The price of a complex asset is the sum of the prices of its component

parts.

   - Assets have different degrees of price sensitivity to a change in the
discount rate or required yield.

   - Factors that influence an asset's price sensitivity include its maturity,
its coupon rate, and the initial level of the required yield.

   - The longer an asset's maturity is, the greater will be its price
sensitivity to a change in the discount rate, other things being equal.

   - The larger an asset's coupon rate is, the lower will be its price
sensitivity to a change in the discount rate, other things being equal.

   - The lower the initial discount rate is, the greater will be the price
sensitivity of most assets to a change in that rate.

   - Duration is a measure of price sensitivity that incorporates maturity,
coupon, and level of yield; it provides an approximation of the
percentage price change for small changes in yield.

   - It is important to be able to measure the price sensitivity of an asset
   - r liability to interest rate changes, and the appropriate measure is the
effective duration.

Questions

```

1. Your broker is recommending that you purchase U.S. government bonds.
Here is the explanation: "Listen, in these times of uncertainty, with many
companies going bankrupt, it makes sense to play it safe and purchase longterm government bonds. They are issued by the U.S. government, so they are
risk free."

How would you respond to the broker?

2. You just inherited 30,000 shares of a company you have never heard

   - f, ABD Corporation. You call your broker to find out whether you
have finally struck it rich. After several minutes, she comes back on the
telephone and says: "I don't have a clue about these shares. It's too bad
they are not traded in a financial market. That would make life a lot
easier for you." What does she mean?
3. Suppose you own a bond that pays \$75 yearly in coupon interest and
is likely to be called in two years (because the firm has already
announced that it will redeem the issue early). The call price will be
\$1,050. What is the price of your bond now, in the market, if the
appropriate discount rate for this asset is 9%?

4. Your broker has advised you to buy shares of Hungry Boy Fast
Foods, which has paid a dividend of \$1.00 per year for 10 years and
will (according to the broker) continue to do so for many years. The
broker believes that the stock, which now has a price of \$12, will be
worth \$25 per share in five years. You have good reason to think that
the discount rate for this firm's stock is 22% per year, because that rate
compensates the buyer for all pertinent risks. Is the stock's present price
a good approximation of its true financial value?

5. You have been considering a zero-coupon bond, which pays no
interest but will pay a principal of \$1,000 at the end of five years. The
price of the bond is now \$712.99, and its required rate of return is 7.0%.
This morning's news contained a surprising development. The
government announced that the rate of inflation appears to be 5.5%
instead of the 4% that most people had been expecting. (Suppose most
people had thought the real rate of interest was 3%.) What would be the
price of the bond, once the market began to absorb this new information
about inflation?

6. State the difference in basis points between each of the following:

a. 5.5% and 6.5%

b. 7% and 9%

c. 6.4% and 7.8%

d. 9.1% and 11.9%

7. a. Does a rise of 100 basis points in the discount rate change the
price of a 20-year bond as much as it changes the price of a four-year
bond, assuming that both bonds have the same coupon rate and offer
the same yield?

b. Does a rise of 100 basis points in the discount rate change the price of a

4% coupon bond as much as it changes the price of a 10% coupon bond,

assuming that both bonds have the same maturity and offer the same yield?

c. Does a rise of 100 basis points in the discount rate change the price of a

10-year bond to the same extent if the discount rate is 4% as it does if the

discount rate is 12%?

8. During the early 1980s, interest rates for many long-term bonds
were above 14%. In the early 1990s, rates on similar bonds were far
lower. What do you think this dramatic decline in market interest rates
means for the price volatility of bonds in response to a change in
interest rates?

9. a. What is the cash flow of a 6% coupon bond that pays interest
annually, matures in seven years, and has a principal of \$1,000?

b. Assuming a discount rate of 8%, what is the price of this bond?

c. Assuming a discount rate of 8.5%, what is the price of this bond?

d. Assuming a discount rate of 7.5%, what is the price of this bond?

e. What is the duration of this bond, assuming that the price is the one you

calculated in part (b)?

f. If the yield changes by 100 basis points, from 8% to 7%, by how much

would you approximate the percentage price change to be, using your

estimate of duration in part (e)?

g. What is the actual percentage price change if the yield changes by 100

basis points?

10. Why is it important to be able to estimate the duration of a bond or
bond portfolio?

11. Explain why you agree or disagree with the following statement:
"Determining the duration of a financial asset is a simple process."

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - how an asset's rate of return is calculated;
   - what is meant by a random variable;
   - what a probability distribution is, and the difference between a
discrete and a continuous probability distribution;

   - the four moments that are used to describe a probability distribution;
   - why it is important to understand the distribution of asset returns;
   - what information is contained in the tails of a probability distribution;
   - the stability property of a probability distribution, and why it is
important for portfolio management and risk management;

   - the statistical properties of the normal distribution;
   - why the normal distribution has been criticized as a probability
distribution for asset return distributions;

   - why nonnormal stable distributions are favored over the normal
distribution for describing asset return distributions;

   - stylized facts about asset return distributions;
   - what joint probability distributions are and why they are needed in
portfolio management and risk management;

   - the use of covariance/correlation to measure the joint randomness of
random variables;

   - the three basic features that an investment risk measure should be

able to take into consideration: (1) relativity of risk, (2)

multidimensionality of risk, and (3) asymmetry of risk;

   - the difference between an arithmetic average return and a geometric

average return;

   - what a reward-risk ratio is, and the different types of such ratios that
can be calculated.

In the chapters 13 and 14, we discuss two important theories: the theory of

portfolio selection and asset pricing theories. These theories are based on

assumptions regarding the probability distribution for asset returns, a

measure of risk, and a reward-risk ratio for constructing and selecting among

alternative portfolios. For example, chapter 13 discusses the theory of

portfolio selection assuming that the probability distribution of returns is

normally distributed and that the measure of risk is the variance. If investors

construct portfolio as the theory suggests, using the Sharpe ratio (one type of

reward-risk ratio explained in this chapter), then one theory of asset pricing

can be derived.

The purpose of this chapter is not only to explain the statistical concepts

needed to understand the theories covered in the next chapter but also to

briefly review alternative probability distributions for returns, alternative

risk measures, and alternative reward-risk ratios that have been used by

practitioners to overcome the drawbacks of the theories explained in the next

two chapters. The coverage here is at a basic level. Courses in financial

theory and risk management provide a more extensive discussion of these

concepts.

What is critical to understand is that the quantitative measures of risk

described here are driven by assumptions and by the estimation of

parameters required to calculate the selected risk measure. Therefore, a

major risk associated with measuring risk is **model risk**, or the risk that the

models are subject to forecasting errors.

```
Measuring the Rate of Return

```

An asset's rate of return (or simply, "return") over a given time interval is

equal to the change in the asset's price plus any distributions received from

holding the asset, expressed as a fraction of the asset's price at the beginning

- f the time interval. When computing the asset's return, it is important to
include any income distributions made to the investor, or the measure of
return will be deficient. The income distribution can be interest income in

the case of a debt obligation or dividend income in the case of a stock.

An asset's return, designated by _R_, is given by:

where

_p_ 0 = price at the beginning of the time interval,

_p_ 1 = price at the end of the time interval, and

_C_ = cash distribution.

For example, if an asset's price increased from \$100 on January 1 to \$105

by December 31 of the same year, and on December 31 a cash distribution of

\$1 was made, then the asset's return for the year would be

```
Return Distributions

```

When studying financial markets, it is critical to understand the distribution

- f the returns of an asset. Moreover, it is necessary to make some
assumption about asset return distributions when building models for
selecting assets to be included in a portfolio. With the exception of a riskfree asset, the return on an asset is a random variable.

A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to the

potential outcomes of an experiment. For example, in the experiment of

tossing a die, we could define the random variable _x_ as the number of dots

- n the face of the die that shows. The possible outcomes (i.e., the numerical
values) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. When tossing a coin, there are two possible

- utcomes: head and tail. The numerical value of 1 can be assigned to the
- utcome of a head occurring and a numerical value of 2 can be assigned to
the outcome of a tail occurring. A random variable can be discrete or
continuous. As the name suggests, a **discrete random variable** limits the

- utcomes so that the random variable can only take on discrete values. A
**continuous random variable** can take on any possible value in the range of
possible outcomes. When a random variable is the return on an asset, the
random variable is assumed to be continuous. Our focus in this chapter is on
continuous random variables.

```
Describing a Probability Distribution

```

A **probability distribution** assigns a probability to each numerical value of

a random variable. For example, in the tossing of a die, each numerical value

- f this random variable is assigned a probability of 1/6. For the coin tossing,
the numerical value for a 1 occurring (an outcome of a head) is 1/2, and the
numerical value for a 2 occurring (an outcome of a tail) is also 1/2.

Throughout most of this book, we will use probability distributions to

describe the probability distribution for asset returns.

There are discrete and continuous probability distributions. Because our

focus is on continuous random variables, we will look at the properties of

various continuous probability distributions.

The information that can be obtained from the continuous probability

distribution of an asset's expected return is critical when pricing assets

(explained in chapter 14) and when constructing portfolios (described in

chapter 13). Four measures are commonly used to describe a probability

distribution: location, dispersion, asymmetry, and concentration in tails. In

statistical terminology, these measures are referred to as the **statistical**

**moments** (or simply, "moments") of a probability distribution.

The **location**  - f a probability distribution is a measure of its central value.

The three measures used to describe **central value** are the mean (or

average), the median, and the mode. There is a relationship among these

three measures that depends on the skewness of a probability distribution, to

be described later. The most commonly used measure of location in finance

is the mean, which is typically denoted by the Greek letter _µ_ ("mu"). The

mean is the **first moment** - f a probability distribution and is also referred to

as the **expected value** . In practice, when computing the central measure for a

random variable from a **sample** - f size _n_, the sample mean is used and is

computed as:

where is equal to the mean of the sample, and _xi_ is the _i_ th observation.

**Dispersion** is a measure of how spread out the potential outcomes are
that can be realized. Although there are various measures of dispersion—
variance, mean absolute deviation, and range—the most commonly used
measure in finance is the variance. The **variance** measures the dispersion of
the outcomes that can be realized relative to the mean and is referred to as

the **second moment** - f a probability distribution. For a sample of size _n_ ( _i_ =

1, 2, …, _n_ ) for random variable _x_, the variance, denoted by var( _x_ ), is

computed as follows:

Basically, the variance is the average of the squared deviations from the

mean. Because the variance is in squared units, the standard root of the

variance is typically used. The square root of the variance is called the

**standard deviation.**

In statistics, the lowercased letter _σ_ ("sigma") of the Greek alphabet is

used to denote the standard deviation, and _σ_ [2] is used to denote the variance.

The same notation is also used in finance.

When we discuss portfolio selection theory in chapter 13, we will see

how, according to this theory, investors who select assets for inclusion in a

portfolio take into consideration only the first two moments of the

probability distribution of return on assets: the mean and variance. [1] For this

reason, portfolio theory is often referred to as **mean-variance analysis** - r

**mean-variance optimization** . The other measures or statistical moments

described below are ignored. More recent approaches to portfolio theory

seek to include moments higher than the second moment.

A probability distribution can be symmetric or asymmetric around its

mean. A commonly used measure for the asymmetry of a distribution is its

**skewness**, which is the **third moment** - f a probability distribution. An

asymmetric distribution can exhibit either negative or positive skewness.

Negative skewness indicates that the distribution is skewed to the left; that

is, compared to the right tail, the left tail is elongated (see figure 12.1, top

panel). Positive skewness indicates that the distribution is skewed to the

right; that is, compared to the left tail, the right tail is elongated (see figure

12.1, bottom panel).

```
Figure 12.1

```

Negative (top panel) and positive (bottom panel) skewed probability distributions.

A probability distribution's skewness measure is denoted by _β_ ("beta")

and ranges from −1 to +1. [2] A probability distribution that is symmetric

around its mean has a _β_ equal to zero. Nonsymmetric probability

distributions (i.e., skewed distributions) have a nonzero _β_ . The value of _β_ can

range from −1 to +1. A positive _β_ means that the probability distribution is

skewed to the right; a negative _β_ means that the probability distribution is

skewed to the left. Unlike the calculation of the mean and the variance,

which have a uniform formula for calculating the value of the moment of a

probability distribution, the definition of skewness does not. The two most

common measures of skewness used are Fisher's skewness and Pearson's

skewness, the latter being equal to the square of the Fisher's skewness.

The tails of a probability distribution contain important information about

potential outcomes. The **tails** - f a probability distribution are the portion of

the distribution that holds information about extreme outcomes that may

arise for the random variable. [3] The "fatness" of the tails of a probability

distribution is related to the peakedness of the distribution around its mean.

The joint measure of peakedness and tail fatness is called **kurtosis** . Kurtosis,

denoted by _α_, is the **fourth moment** - f a probability distribution and

determines the tail weight. As for skewness, there is no standard measure for

kurtosis. Fisher's kurtosis and Pearson's kurtosis are two commonly used

measures. Fisher's kurtosis, also referred to as **excess kurtosis**, is found by

subtracting three from Pearson's kurtosis.

In addition to the four commonly used moments just explained for

describing a probability distribution, a concept called an _α_ - quantile is also

used. The _**α**_ **-quantile** provides information about where the first _α_ % of the

probability distribution is located. Given an arbitrary observation of some

probability distribution, this observation will be less than the _α_ - quantile,

denoted by _qα_, in _α_ % of the cases and will exceed it in (100 − _α_ )% of the

cases. There are special names given to some quantiles: quartiles and

percentiles. The 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles are referred to as **quartiles**,

with the 25% quantile being the first quartile, the 50% quantile being the

second quartile, and the 75% quantile being the third quartile. The 1%, 2%,

…, 98%, and 99% quantiles are called **percentiles.**

```
Continuous Probability Distributions Used to Describe Returns

```

Numerous probability distributions have been used to describe asset returns.

We limit our discussion to distributions that have a specific desirable

property for the purpose of portfolio theory, the **stability property** . The

family of probability distributions that possess the stability property is the

**stable distribution** . A special case of the stable distribution is the **normal**

**distribution**, the distribution that dominates portfolio theory and much of

financial theory. We first describe the normal distribution and then discuss

the family of stable distributions.

**`Normal distribution`** The normal distribution, also referred to as the
Gaussian distribution, is a bell-shaped distribution (see figure 12.2). The
normal distribution is symmetric around the mean. This means that half of
the probability distribution is below the mean (i.e., to the left of the mean in
figure 12.2) and half is above the mean (i.e., to the right of the mean in
figure 12.2). Another well-known characteristic of the normal distribution is
that approximately 68% of the probability is given to values that lie in an
interval of one standard deviation around the mean, and the probability is
about 95% when the interval is two standard deviations around the mean.

Nearly all the probability is assigned to values within three standard

deviations around the mean (99%).

```
Figure 12.2

```

Normal (Gaussian) probability distribution; _σ_ denotes the standard deviation.

In terms of the four moments of a continuous probability distribution, the

normal distribution can be described as follows. First, the measure of central

value, the location parameter, equals the mean of the distribution (µ), and the

measure of dispersion is the variance ( _σ_ [2] ). Because the normal distribution is

symmetric, the skewness measure ( _β_ ) is equal to zero. The Fisher kurtosis

(excess kurtosis) measure for the normal distribution is 3.

With respect to kurtosis, figure 12.3 shows the difference between a

normal probability distribution and a probability distribution that is

symmetric but not normally distributed. For both distributions, the mean is

zero and the variance is equal to 1. [4] As can be seen, the symmetric

nonnormal distribution is characterized by a higher peak at the mean (i.e.,

zero is the mean) than the normal distribution. A probability distribution

with this characteristic is said to be a **leptokurtic distribution** .

```
Figure 12.3

```

Difference between a standard normal distribution and a distribution with high excess kurtosis.

Figure 12.3 shows the implications for the tails of the distribution for the

nonnormal symmetric distribution compared to the normal distribution as a

result of the former's greater peakedness. The greater peakedness causes the

tails of the symmetric nonnormal distribution to be fatter than those for the

normal distribution. When a probability distribution has this characteristic, it

is said to be a "fat-tailed distribution" or a "heavy-tailed distribution."

Because the Fisher (excess) kurtosis measure for a normal distribution is 3,

the same measure for a fat-tailed distribution will be greater than 3. If

instead of having greater peakedness than a normal distribution, a

probability has less peakedness, the probability distribution is said to be a

**platykurtic distribution** . For such probability distributions, there is less

probability in the tails than in the normal distribution, and they will have a

Fisher kurtosis measure that is less than 3.

Let's look at actual returns distributions for the major stock market

indices of several countries: the United States in figure 12.4 (Standard &

Poor's 500, S&P 500), Germany in figure 12.5 (Deutscher Aktienindex,

DAX), Japan in figure 12.6 (Nihon Keizai Shinbun, Nikkei 225), and the

United Kingdom in figure 12.7 (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100, FTSE

100). [5] Although a visualization of the figures for all indices and all periods

suggests that the distributions are not normal, a more rigorous analysis is

required to make that determination. Statistical tests are used to determine

whether a distribution is normal. We will not discuss these tests here, but

they are the Jacque-Bera test, the Anderson-Darling test, and the

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In general, these tests reject the hypothesis that

the distributions are drawn from a normal distribution.

**`Stability property`** There is a highly desirable property of the normal
distribution that makes it attractive in dealing with asset returns for the
purpose of portfolio theory as well as risk management. [6] The property,
referred to as the "stability property," states that the sum of a number of _N_
random variables that follow a normal distribution will again be a normal
distribution, provided that the random variables behave independently of one
another.

The stability property is important for two reasons in portfolio theory and

risk management. First, suppose that an investor has a portfolio of 80 stocks,

and each of those 80 stocks is assumed to follow a normal distribution and

behave independently of every other one. The stability property of the

normal distribution means that the portfolio return (where the portfolio is

composed of those 80 stocks) will follow a normal distribution. In our

discussion of probability distributions below, the discussion is restricted to

those distributions that satisfy the stability property. The second reason is

that the stability property allows aggregation of asset returns over time. An

example is the daily returns of some stock. If the daily return for the stock is

assumed to be normally distributed, and if an investor aggregates the daily

returns to obtain a weekly return for that stock, then by the stability property,

the weekly return is also normally distributed.

**`Attacks on the normal distribution`** The use of the normal distribution

has been criticized on empirical grounds. According to the normal

distribution, holding an asset will expose an investor to small-percentage

daily losses and small-percentage daily gains much more often than it will

expose the investor to negligible or extreme fluctuations. However, a

preponderance of empirical evidence based on observed returns for various

asset classes and for different countries leads to rejection of the hypothesis

that return distributions are normally distributed. [7] The empirical evidence

from many countries has shown that asset returns exhibit fat tails relative to

the normal distribution. The implication is that the extreme values (i.e., the

values found in the tails of a distribution) are more likely to occur (i.e., have

a higher probability of occurrence) than predicted by the normal distribution.

This means that between periods in which the market for an asset exhibits

relatively modest changes in price, there will be periods in which the

changes are much greater (i.e., market crashes and market booms) than

predicted by the normal distribution. In the case of stocks, the presence of fat

tails can help explain larger price fluctuations for stocks over short periods

than can be explained by changes in fundamental economic variables, as

Robert Shiller has observed. [8]

The extreme losses that occurred during the financial crisis of 2008–2009

raised the question of whether existing models and practices, largely based

- n the normal distribution, represent an adequate and reliable framework for
portfolio management and risk management. However, empirical attacks on
the use of the normal distribution are not solely of recent vintage. Empirical
studies on the properties of asset return distributions date back to the
pioneering work of Benoit Mandelbrot [9] and Eugene Fama. [10] Shortly after the
publication of their research rejecting the normal distribution, Paul Cootner
expressed his concern regarding the implications of that finding for their
statistical tests, stating:

Almost without exception, past econometric work is meaningless. Surely, before consigning centuries

- f work to the ash pile, we should like to have some assurance that all our work is truly useless. If we
have permitted ourselves to be fooled for as long as this into believing that the Gaussian assumption is
a workable one, is it not possible that the Paretian revolution is similarly illusory? [11]

Despite the Mandelbrot-Fama findings, as well as numerous other studies,

the "normality" assumption remains the cornerstone of many leading

theories used in finance.

**`Family of stable distributions`** Alternative probability distributions to
describe asset returns have been proposed and empirically tested. Testing of
these alternative probability distributions is necessary, because there is no
fundamental theory that can suggest a distributional model for asset returns,
and hence the problem remains largely a statistical one. Our focus here is on
the class of probability distributions known as the stable distribution.

Mandelbrot and Fama not only rejected the assumption of normality

based on their empirical work, they also proposed an alternative probability

distribution to replace the normal distribution, the stable Paretian

distribution. A major drawback to all the alternative probability distribution

models tested is their failure to satisfy the stability property, which is a

highly desirable property for asset returns in the context of portfolio

management. Only for the class of stable distributions does one obtain the

property that portfolio returns follow a stable distribution. By "class" of a

probability distribution, we mean that there are probability distributions that

fall into the category of the distribution (i.e., they have the general statistical

properties of the distribution).

The class of stable distributions is a large and flexible class of probability

distributions that also allows skewness and heavy tails for asset returns. The

normal distribution turns out to be one particular case of the class of stable

distributions that is symmetric. To distinguish between the normal

distribution and nonnormal distributions that are in the class of stable

distributions, Mandelbrot referred to nonnormal stable distributions as **stable**

**Paretian distributions** - r **Lévy stable distributions** .

A stable distribution is described by four parameters:

1. a location parameter ( _µ_ ),
2. a scale parameter ( _σ_ ),
3. a skewness parameter ( _β_ ), and
4. a kurtosis parameter ( _α_ ).

When _β_ ≠ 0, the stable distribution is skewed and is characterized by fat

tails. That is, there is a high probability that an extreme outcome may occur

relative to what could occur for a normal distribution when the kurtosis

parameter ( _α_ ) has a value that is less than 2. The value for _α_, also referred to

as the **index of stability**, is positive but cannot exceed 2. The range for the

skewness parameter, _β_, is from −1 to +1. The stable distribution is skewed to

the right if _β_ is positive and skewed to the left if _β_ is negative.

The normal distribution and the Lévy distribution are special cases of the

stable distribution. [12]

From a computational perspective, the major drawback to the stable

nonnormal distributions (i.e., stable Paretian distributions) is that the

variance equals infinity because of the tail behavior of the stable nonnormal

distribution. The implication for portfolio theory will be clear when we

discuss the theory in chapter 13, where we explain the critical role of the

variance. A second problem involves another technical point regarding the

ability to estimate the probability function. Basically, with the exception of

the normal distribution and Lévy distribution, [13] there is no closed-form

expression (i.e., analytical solution) for a stable Paretian distribution.

Although this may have been a valid problem with the use of stable

distributions at one time, that is no longer the case, because significant

advances in computational finance over the past 25 years have made it fairly

straightforward to fit observed returns to determine a stable Paretian

distribution's parameters.

Although observed stock returns exhibit tails thicker than those of the

normal distribution, they are still inconsistent with the size of the tails

predicted by the stable Paretian distribution. More recently, **tempered stable**

**distributions** have been suggested for modeling the distribution of stock

returns; such distributions address not only the issue of tail thickness being

more consistent with observed stock returns but also the problem of infinite

variance. The mathematics of the tempered stable distribution is beyond the

scope of this chapter, but the basic idea is simple. Tempered stable

distributions are obtained from the class of stable distributions through a

process called "tail tempering." Tail tempering is accomplished by

modifying only the tails of stable distributions so that they remain thicker

than the tails of the normal distribution but do not lead to an infinite

volatility. [14]

```
Some Stylized Facts about Stock Returns

```

An extensive body of empirical research on stock returns in the stock

markets of many countries has accumulated since the early 1960s. A fair

conclusion from these studies leads to several stylized facts. As used here,

the expression "stylized facts" refers to empirical findings that are consistent

for different times and different country stock markets investigated. They are

(1) skewness, (2) fat tails, (3) volatility clustering, (4) autoregressive

behavior, and (5) the temporal behavior of tail thickness. [15]

The first two stylized facts were discussed earlier. **Skewness**  - f stock

returns means that asymmetry exists in the upside and downside potential of

price changes. There can be negative or positive skewness. Negative

(positive) skewness means that price behavior is such that more negative

(positive) stock price changes are exhibited than would be suggested by a

symmetric distribution. **Fat tails** means that the probability of extreme price

movements (up and down) is much larger than predicted by the normal

distribution. **Volatility clustering** means that large price changes tend to be

followed by large price changes, and small price changes tend to be followed

by small price changes. **Autoregressive behavior** means that price changes

depend on price changes in the past (e.g., positive price changes tend to be

followed by positive price changes). Finally, the **temporal behavior of tail**

**thickness** means that the probability of extreme price changes through time
is smaller in normal markets and much larger in turbulent markets.

```
Joint Probability Distributions

```

Thus far we have discussed the probability distribution of a single random

variable, the return on an asset. A probability distribution that involves only

a single random variable is referred to as a **univariate probability**

**distribution** and helps us understand the attributes of the returns for an

individual asset. However, in chapters 13 and 14, we will be considering a

portfolio of assets and therefore will be interested in the probability

distribution for multiple assets. This requires that we expand our

understanding of probability distributions from univariate probability

distributions to **multivariate probability distributions**, or what is referred

to as **joint probability distributions** .

To understand the concept of a joint probability distribution using asset

returns, suppose that an investor has constructed a portfolio consisting of the

common stock of two companies, company ABC and company XYZ. There

is a univariate probability distribution for the return on the common stock of

company ABC and a univariate probability distribution for the return on the

common stock of company XYZ. The return distribution for the common

stock of each company is called the **marginal probability distribution** .

Suppose an investor is interested in the return on a portfolio consisting of the

common stock of these two companies. The portfolio return of interest is

known as a **joint probability distribution** .

When dealing with joint probability distributions, an investor is faced

with the interdependence between the two return distributions. For example,

in the case of the returns for the common stock of companies ABC and

XYX, do large returns for company ABC imply large returns for the stock of

company XYZ or small returns for the common stock of company XYZ?

This property is referred to as the **dependence of random variables** . When

there is no dependence between two random variables, the two random

variables are said to be **independently distributed** . Although there is a

technical definition of what is meant by independently distributed, the basic

idea is simple in the special case of only two random variables. The two

random variables are said to be independently distributed if the value of one

random variable does not provide any information about the value of the

- ther random variable.

Although the field of statistics offers several ways to measure the

dependence between two random variables, the measure used in finance is

the covariance or equivalently, correlation.

```
Covariance and Correlations

```

The **covariance** - f two random variables is a measure of the joint variation

- f the random variables, where the association is assumed to be a linear one.
In the case of two random variables, the covariance is calculated with
sample data as follows. Let _x_ and _y_ be two random variables, and denote

_n_

their sample means by and _ӯ,_ respectively. Assuming that there are

- bservations for the two random variables, then the covariance between the
two random variables _x_ and _y_, denoted by cov( _x_, _y_ ), is

In words, the covariance is calculated by (1) calculating for all

- bservations for each random variable the deviation from its respective
mean, (2) multiplying for each observation the deviation for each random
variable, (3) summing the product of the deviations, and (4) dividing by the
number of observations. The sample covariance is then the average of all
joint deviations.

A problem with the covariance is that it is affected by the scale of the

random variables. In other words, the covariance is _scaling variant_ . As a

result, it is not possible to compare any pair of covariances, and it is difficult

to interpret their values. For example, suppose that for our two random

variables, _x_ and _y_, the computed covariance is 30. Suppose that _x_ is

_x_

measured in a different way, such as 20 + 10 . A mathematical property of

the covariance is that the covariance would be 10 times the original

covariance. That is, the covariance would be 300.

To deal with this problem, an alternative but related measure can be

developed by dividing the covariance by the variance of the two random

variables. The resulting measure is called the **Pearson correlation**

**coefficient**, or simply the **correlation coefficient** . That is, the correlation
coefficient, denoted by cor( _x_, _y_ ), is

where var( _x_ ) and var( _y_ ) are the sample variances as computed using equation

(12.2).

The correlation coefficient can then be shown to have a value between −1

and 1, where −1 means the two random variables are perfectly negatively

correlated, and 1 means they are perfectly positively correlated. Unlike the

covariance, the correlation coefficient is not affected by the scale of the two

random variables and is therefore said to be _scale invariant_ .

```
Portfolio Risk Measures

```

In portfolio theory, which we describe in chapter 13, the variance of a

portfolio's return has historically been the most commonly used measure of

investment risk. However, investors have developed different investment

strategies in their attempt to realize their investment objectives.

Consequently, financial theorists, practitioners, and regulators have come to

believe that it is difficult to accept the view that there is only one definition

- f investment risk. Moreover, the variance or standard deviation as a risk
measure may no longer be suitable if returns are not normally distributed.

Before exploring alternative measures of risk, let us discuss the basic

features of investment risk measures. Leslie A. Balzer has argued that a risk

measure is investor specific, and therefore there is "no single universally

acceptable risk measure." [16] He proposed three basic features that an

investment risk measure should be able to take into consideration: (1)

relativity of risk, (2) multidimensionality of risk, and (3) asymmetry of risk.

**Relativity of risk** means that the risk should be related to performing
worse than some alternative investment or benchmark. Several proposals in
the literature have suggested that investment risk be measured by the
probability of the investment realizing a return that is less than an investor's
designated risk benchmark. [17] In addition, an investor could have multiple
investment objectives, which would call for multiple risk benchmarks. This
is what Balzer means by **multidimensionality of risk** . The key is identifying

a suitable benchmark that reflects an investor's investment objectives.

Finally, **asymmetry of risk** means that it is reasonable to expect that risk is

an asymmetric concept related to downside outcomes. Consequently, any

realistic candidate for an investment risk measure should value upside and

downside differently. Although the standard deviation considers positive and

negative deviations from the mean as a potential risk, for this measure,

- utperforming relative to the mean is penalized just as much as
underperforming.

```
Value-at-Risk Measure

```

The **value-at-risk** (VaR) measure is defined as the minimum level of loss at

a given, sufficiently high, confidence level for a predefined time horizon.

Figure 12.8 illustrates the VaR measure graphically.

```
Figure 12.8

```

Illustration of the value-at-risk (VaR) measure.

A VaR's predefined time horizon could be a time period of any length.

The confidence level that is often used in practice is either 95% or 99%.

Banks, for example, calculate a daily VaR. For example, suppose a portfolio

has a one-week 95% VaR equal to \$10 million. This means that over the

horizon of one week, the portfolio may lose more than \$10 million with

probability equal to 1 minus the confidence interval, 5% in our example. The

probability of 1 minus the confidence level is called the **tail probability** .

Although this example is in terms of a portfolio's dollar loss, the VaR for a

portfolio can be calculated in terms of percentage returns. Suppose that the

market value for a portfolio is \$100 million. If the one-week 95% VaR of the

return distribution is 2%, then over the time horizon of one week, the

portfolio may lose more than 2% (\$2 million) of the portfolio's market value

with probability equal to 5%.

As with all quantitative risk measures described here, VaR is heavily

dependent on the probability distribution assumed for the returns. A VaR can

be computed assuming a normal distribution, a _t_ - distribution, or a stable

distribution, for example. VaR varies with the assumed distribution, because

the tails of the distribution are different. An assumption about the return

distribution that does not reflect the true distribution can lead to an underor

- verestimation of VaR for a given confidence level. As we discuss in chapter
13, where we cover portfolio theory, if VaR is used as the measure of the risk
that is to be minimized in selecting an optimal portfolio, then the portfolio
constructed based on the optimization process will not in fact be optimal,
because the risk measure fails to reflect the true portfolio risk.

The calculation of VaR is not as simple as calculating the dispersion

measures discussed earlier. Various methods have been employed to

calculate VaR. The three most common methods in practice are the

RiskMetrics method, the historical method, and the Monte Carlo method. An

explanation of these methods and their underlying principles is beyond the

scope of this chapter. What is important to understand now is that the VaR is

more complex to calculate than the dispersion measures, but because of the

importance of identifying the true risk of a portfolio, computational

complexity is not a reason to shy away from difficult calculations of a risk

measure.

Bank regulators throughout the world have adopted VaR as a measure of

risk for banks. One of the advantages of VaR is that it is easily understood.

However, that does not mean that it is the risk measure of choice for all

market participants. VaR has a well-known deficiency because it fails to

satisfy one of the theoretical properties of what is referred to as a "coherent"

risk measure. The four properties of a coherent risk measure are

monotonicity, positive homogeneity, subadditivity, and translation

invariance. The problem with the VaR is that it does not always satisfy the

subadditivity property (i.e., the property dealing with diversification). It

turns out that the VaR for a portfolio may be greater than the sum of the

VaRs of the assets composing the portfolio. Thus, the VaR could show more

risk if assets were combined into a portfolio than if the assets were held in

isolation.

VaR provides a good opportunity to illustrate the notion of model risk

that we discussed in the introduction to this chapter. JPMorgan Chase

developed its own VaR for measurement of firmwide risk and risk for its

trading operations. In its filings with the SEC, it reports daily VaR, using a

95% confidence interval. In April 2012, JPMorgan Chase reported that the

bank changed the model it was using to compute VaR. According to the new

model, the VaR was \$115 million, an amount 24% less than under the

previous VaR model used at the beginning of 2012. This was the first of

several changes to JPMorgan Chase's VaR model beginning in January 2012

that significantly changed the bank's VaR. [18] These changes to JPMorgan

Chase's VaR model and the impact on the daily VaR came to light as a result

- f the bank's trading loss of more than \$6.2 billion in 2012, a number
inconsistent with a daily VaR of anything in the range of \$100 million. In
testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, it was alleged by
JPMorgan Chase's chief executive officer, Jamie Dimon, that the trading loss
was attributable to the adoption of a new VaR that understated risks. The key
takeaway from JPMorgan Chase's use of its VaR model is that these models
are far from perfect.

```
Conditional Value-at-Risk Measure

```

There is another limitation to the use of VaR as a measure of risk, which

brings us to our next related risk measure: **conditional value-at-risk**

(CVaR). For a given tail probability, CVaR is defined as the average of the

VaRs that are larger than the VaR at that tail probability. Therefore, CVaR

focuses on the losses in the tail that are larger than the corresponding VaR

level. Because CVaR indicates the magnitude of such losses, it is also

referred to as the **average value-at-risk** (AvaR) measure. [19]

Like the VaR, the CVaR has an intuitive interpretation. Unlike the VaR,

however, the CVaR is a coherent risk measure: It satisfies all four required

properties discussed earlier. Moreover, it overcomes one other drawback of

the VaR: It is not informative about the magnitude of the losses larger than

the VaR level.

There are convenient ways for computing and estimating CVaR that

permit its application to optimal portfolio design and risk management.

However, a discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of this chapter.

```
Reward-Risk Ratios

```

In portfolio theory, an important metric is a measure of the return realized

relative to the risk accepted. Typically, these metrics are referred to as

**reward-risk ratios** and are widely used as a criterion for selection among

alternative portfolios and as metrics for evaluating the performance of a

portfolio manager or the performance of an asset class. The higher the ratio

is, the better the performance will be. The numerator of the ratio is some

measure of return, and the denominator is some measure of risk.

```
Reward Measures

```

For applications in finance where the reward-risk ratio is presented in terms

- f the return on an asset or the return on a portfolio, the reward is the
realized return. The realized return is an average return realized over a time
interval. For example, if the time interval is a month and there are five years

- f monthly returns, then the realized return is the average monthly return.
The average return can be computed in one of two ways: as an arithmetic
average return or as a geometric average.

The **arithmetic average return** is an unweighted average of the returns

achieved during a series of such measurement intervals. The general formula

is

_RA_ = ( _RP_ 1 + _RP_ 2 + … + _RPT_ ) / _T_,

where

_RA_ = the arithmetic average return,

_RPk_ = return in period _k_ ( _k_ = 1, …, _T_ ), and

_T_ = number of time periods.

For example, let's consider an investor who realized the following portfolio

returns: −10%, 20%, and 5% in July, August, and September, respectively.

The arithmetic average monthly return is 5%.

The arithmetic average return for a portfolio can be thought of as the

mean value of the withdrawals (expressed as a fraction of the initial portfolio

value) that can be made at the end of each interval while maintaining the

initial portfolio value intact. In the preceding example, the investor must add

10% of the initial portfolio value at the end of the first month, can withdraw

20% of the initial portfolio value at the end of the second month, and then

can withdraw 5% of the initial portfolio value at the end of the third month.

The **geometric average return**, also referred to as the **time-weighted**

**average return**, measures the compounded rate of growth of the initial

value, assuming that all cash distributions are reinvested. The general

formula is

_RG_ = [(1 + _RP_ 1) (1 + _RP_ 2) … (1 + _RPT_ )] [1/] _[T]_ - 1,

where _RG_ is the geometric average return and _RPk_ and _N_ are as defined for the

arithmetic average return.

For example, if the portfolio returns were −10%, 20%, and 5% in July,

August, and September, as in the preceding example, then the geometric

average return would be

_RG_ = [(1 + (‒0.10)) (1 + 0.20) … (1 + 0.05)] [1/3] - 1 = 0.043.

As the geometric average return is 4.3% per month, \$1 invested in the

portfolio at the end of June would have grown at a rate of 4.3% per month

during the three-month period.

In general, the arithmetic average and geometric average returns do not

provide the same answers, because computation of the arithmetic average

return assumes the initial amount invested is maintained (through additions

- r withdrawals) at its initial portfolio value. In contrast, the geometric
average return is the return on a portfolio that varies in size because of the
assumption that all proceeds are reinvested.

An example shows how the two averages fail to coincide. Consider a

portfolio with a \$100 million market value at the beginning of 2017, a \$200

million value at the end of 2017, and a \$100 million value at the end of

2018. The annual returns are 100% and −50%. The arithmetic average return

is 25%, whereas the geometric average return is 0%. The arithmetic average

return consists of the average of the \$100 million withdrawn at the end of

2017 and the \$50 million replaced at the end of 2018. The rate of return is

clearly zero; however, the 100% return in 2017 is exactly offset by the 50%

loss in 2018 on the larger investment base. In this example, the arithmetic

average return exceeds the geometric average return. This outcome always

proves to be true, except in the special situation where the returns in each

interval are the same, in which case the averages are identical

Now that we know that the realized return should be computed using the

geometric average return, let's look at how the reward (i.e., numerator) is

calculated for a reward-risk ratio. The reward can be measured on an

absolute or relative basis. Reward-risk ratios that use _absolute_ rewards use in

the numerator the difference between the realized return and the risk-free

rate, or zero. When the reward is measured on a _relative_ basis, it is the

difference between the realized return and a benchmark selected by a client.

The most popular reward-risk ratio that measures the reward on an

absolute basis is the **Sharpe ratio** . [20] The risk-free return is used to reduce

the realized return in this reward-risk ratio:

Two well-known reward-risk ratios that measure reward on a relative return

basis (i.e., a return in excess of the benchmark) are the Sortino ratio and the

information ratio:

```
Risk Measure

```

The denominators of these three ratios all represent a different measure of

risk. The Sharpe ratio has come under attack by researchers and practitioners

because of its use of the standard deviation (variance) as a measure of risk,

which fails to recognize that the return distribution is likely to be skewed.

The Sortino ratio addresses this criticism of the Sharpe ratio by using the

standard deviation of only the realized returns that are less than the

minimum acceptable return. The information ratio uses a risk measure that is

calculated by first computing the realized return minus the benchmark return

and using those observations to compute the standard deviation. This

standard deviation measure is more popularly referred to in the investment

management community as "tracking error."

```
Key Points

```

- An asset's return over a given time interval is equal to the change in the
asset's price plus any distributions received from holding the asset,
expressed as a fraction of the asset's price at the beginning of the time
interval.

   - With the exception of a risk-free asset, the return on an asset is a
random variable.

   - When constructing a portfolio of assets, it is necessary to make some
assumption about asset return distributions.

   - A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to the
potential outcomes of an experiment.

   - A discrete random variable limits the outcomes such that the random

variable can only take on discrete values. When the random variable

can take on any possible value within the range of possible outcomes, it

is a continuous random variable.

- When the random variable of interest is the return on an asset, the

random variable is assumed to be continuous.

- Probability distributions are used to describe the potential outcomes
- f a random variable.
- Four commonly used measures to describe a probability distribution
(and referred to as the "statistical moments" of a distribution) are
location, dispersion, asymmetry, and concentration in tails.

- A probability distribution's location is a measure of its central value
(the first moment), and the measures used to describe this moment are
the mean (or average), the median, and the mode.

- The most commonly used measure of location in finance is the mean
- r value.
- A measure of the variability of the outcomes that can be realized is
the second moment of a probability distribution: dispersion. The three
most commonly used measures of dispersion are the variance, mean
absolute deviation, and range.

- Variance is a measure of the dispersion of the outcome that can be
realized relative to the mean and is basically the average of the squared
deviations from the mean. The square root of the variance is the
standard deviation.

- The asymmetry of a probability distribution around its mean is its
skewness and is the third moment of a probability distribution. An
asymmetric distribution can exhibit either negative skewness (skewed
to the left) or positive skewness (skewed to the right).

- The two most commonly used measures of skewness are Fisher's
skewness and Pearson's skewness, the latter being equal to the square

- f Fisher's skewness.
- The tail of a probability distribution is the portion of the distribution
that contains information about extreme outcomes that may arise for the
random variable.

- The peakedness of a probability distribution affects how fat the tails

are.

- The fourth moment of a probability distribution is measured by its
kurtosis, which is the joint measure of peakedness and tail fatness.

- Two measures of kurtosis are Fisher's kurtosis (also referred to as
excess kurtosis) and Pearson's kurtosis.

- The _α_ - quantile of a probability distribution provides information
about where the first _α_ % of the probability distribution is located.

- A desirable property that a probability distribution should possess
when used in portfolio and risk management is the stability property.
The class of probability distributions that have this property is known
as the stable distribution.

- The normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a bell-shaped
distribution that is symmetric around the mean. It is a special case of a
stable distribution.

- Only the first two moments, mean and variance, are needed to
describe a normal distribution. A symmetric nonnormal distribution
characterized by a higher (lower) peak at the mean than the normal
distribution is said to be a leptokurtic (platykurtic) distribution and has
a fatter (thinner) tail than the normal distribution.

- The stability property that a normal distribution satisfies is that the
sum of _N_ random variables that follow a normal distribution will again
be a normal distribution, provided that the random variables behave
independently of one another.

- The stability property is important in portfolio theory and risk
management. The stability property means that (1) the portfolio return
(where the portfolio is composed of assets whose returns are normally
distributed) will follow a normal distribution and (2) its use allows the
aggregation of asset returns over time.

- Empirical evidence does not support the assumption that real-world
asset return distributions are best described by a normal distribution;
instead, they exhibit fatter tails than predicted by the normal
distribution.

- Because there is no fundamental theory that can suggest a
distributional model for asset returns, alternative distributions must be

empirically tested.

- Because of its desirable characteristics with respect to the stability
property, the stable distribution has been suggested to describe asset
return distributions.

- The class of stable distributions is a large and flexible class of
probability distributions, which also allows for skewness and heavytailedness for asset returns. Because this class includes as a special case
the normal distribution, a nonnormal stable distribution is referred to as

a "Paretian stable distribution."

- A stable distribution is described by four parameters: a location
parameter, scale parameter, skewness parameter, and kurtosis parameter
(called the "index of stability").

- In the past, certain computational aspects made it difficult to use the
Paretian stable distribution for portfolio management (e.g., an infinite
variance), but advances in computational finance and modeling (i.e., the
tempered stable distribution) have eliminated those problems.

- Five stylized facts have been observed for asset return distributions:
(1) skewness, (2) fat tails, (3) volatility clustering, (4) autoregressive
behavior, and (5) temporal behavior of tail thickness.

- In portfolio management and risk management, the probability
distribution of interest is the joint probability distribution.

- Covariance/correlation is the commonly used way to measure the
dependence between two random variables.

- A measure of the joint variation of two random variables that are
assumed to be in a linear association is the covariance and its related

measure, the correlation.

- The correlation measure overcomes the limitation of the covariance

measure, which depends on the scale used to measure the random

variable. The range of the correlation is −1 to 1.

- The three basic features that an investment risk measure should be

able to take into consideration are (1) relativity of risk, (2)

multidimensionality of risk, and (3) asymmetry of risk.

   - Relativity of risk means that risk should be related to an asset's
performing worse than some alternative investment or benchmark.

   - Because an investor could have multiple investment objectives,
multiple risk benchmarks are necessary, which underscores what is
meant by the multidimensionality of risk.

   - Asymmetry of risk means that because it is reasonable to expect that
risk is an asymmetric concept related to the downside outcome, any
realistic candidate for an investment risk measure has to value upside
and downside outcomes differently.

   - Two alternative risk measures proposed are value-at-risk (VaR) and
conditional value-at-risk (CvaR).

   - VaR is defined as the minimum level of loss at a given, sufficiently
high confidence level for a predefined time horizon.

   - A limitation of the use of VaR as a measure of risk is that it ignores
the amount of losses larger than the VaR at that tail probability.

   - CVaR (also called "average value at risk") for a given tail probability
is defined as the average of the VaRs and hence focuses on the losses in
the tail that are larger than the corresponding VaR level.

   - An average return can be calculated as either an arithmetic average
return or a geometric average return, with the latter being the preferred
method.

   - Reward-risk ratios measure the reward on a relative or absolute basis.
  - The best-known and most commonly applied reward-risk ratio in
finance is the Sharpe ratio, but because of the Sharpe ratio's drawbacks,
the Sortino ratio is preferred.

   - Reward-risk ratios can be calculated based on different reward

measures and different risk measures.

Questions

```

1. Suppose an investor acquires an asset for \$20 and sells that asset for \$22

- ne year later. During that period, a cash distribution of \$1 was received by
the investor just prior to the sale of the asset. What is the investor's one-year
rate of return?

2. Explain why the return on an asset that does not pay a cash
distribution over the time interval it is held is equal to the ratio of its
selling price to its purchase price, then subtracting 1 from the computed
ratio.

3. Why are measures of risk dependent on the probability distribution
assumed for returns or profits and losses?

4. A portfolio manager is working with the firm's quantitative team to
develop a risk model for the firm. The portfolio manager suggests
(based on experience) building the model based on a certain probability
distribution of returns. A member of the quantitative team points out
that the problem with the probability distribution proposed is that it
does not satisfy the stability property. The portfolio manager does not
understand the objection. Explain the issue to the portfolio manager.

5. Some practitioners and researchers believe that risk cannot be
captured in a single number. How does this statement relate to one of
the three features of a risk measure as suggested by Leslie Balzer?

6. When a normal distribution is assumed for the return distribution,
why are observations three standard deviations above the mean viewed
as representing "tail risk"?

7. A study of daily returns for the S&P 500 by Cook Pine Capital LLC
investigated returns from December 30, 1927, through November 21,
8. [21] For the 20,319 daily returns, the following information was
reported:

Mean: 0.026%,

Standard deviation: 1.182%,

Kurtosis: 18.347,

Skewness: −0.098,

Maximum daily return: 16.61%, and

Minimum daily return: −20.47%.

The table below shows the daily return distribution as observed over the

period and what the normal distribution would predict. The distribution is in

terms of the number of standard distributions above the mean.

What does the information in the table suggest about the daily return

distribution for the S&P 500?

8. One vendor of risk models, FinAnalytica, publishes daily risk
measures. The following extracts are from the company's website: [22]

As an industry standard, Value at Risk (VaR) measures the worst expected loss of a portfolio over a

specific time interval at a given confidence level. Most commercial risk analytics products today

measure VaR based on the thin-tailed and symmetric normal, "bell-shaped" distribution curve. As

demonstrated by the current crisis, these normal distribution assumptions result in overly optimistic

VaR estimates and they inadequately account for extreme events.

a. Explain what is meant by the above excerpt.

FinAnalytica's Cognity risk management software platform uses fat-tailed, asymmetrical distributions

throughout, and incorporates the most advanced statistical methods to model extreme events, volatility

clustering, regime switching and correlation shifts in times of market crisis.

b. In the above excerpt, what is meant by "extreme events"?

c. What is meant by "volatility clustering"?

d. Why do you think it is important to model "correlation shifts in times of

market crisis"?

Cognity risk analytics provide more accurate fat-tailed VaR estimates that do not suffer from the over

- ptimism of normal distributions.

e. In the above excerpt, what is meant by "the over-optimism of normal

distributions"?

But Cognity goes beyond VaR and also provides the downside Expected Tail Loss (ETL) measure—

the average or expected loss beyond VaR. As compared with volatility and VaR, ETL, also known as

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), is a highly informative and intuitive

measure of extreme downside losses.

f. In the above excerpt, explain what each of the concepts of risk means.

9. Nicholas Taleb, a trader and the author of a body of work attacking
risk measures used by financial institutions, wrote an article titled "Ten
Principles for a Black Swan–Proof World." One of the principles listed
in the article is the following:

_Do not let someone making an "incentive" bonus manage a nuclear plant—or your financial risks_ .

Odds are he would cut every corner on safety to show "profits" while claiming to be "conservative."

Bonuses do not accommodate the hidden risks of blow-ups. It is the asymmetry of the bonus system

that got us here. No incentives without disincentives: capitalism is about rewards and punishments, not

just rewards. [23]

a. How does this principle apply to the issue of measuring risks that banks

must report to regulators?

b. How does this principle relate to the 2012 trading loss of \$6.2 billion by

JPMorgan Chase bank?

10. Suppose that the monthly returns for two investors is as follows:

Month Investor 1 (%) Investor 2 (%)

1 9 25

2 13 13

3 22 22

4 - 18 - 24

a. What is the arithmetic average monthly return for the two investors?

b. What is the geometric average monthly return for the two investors?

c. Why does the arithmetic average monthly return diverge more from the

geometric monthly return for investor 2 than for investor 1?

11. The following statements appeared in an article by James Picerno: [24]

It's easier to identify weak points in a given risk metric than to offer solutions. So, fairly or not, the

Sharpe ratio's various flaws have been dissected in numerous studies over the years. Its leading

drawback is arguably the fact that financial market returns don't follow a normal statistical

distribution.

a. In the above excerpt, why is the drawback related to the use of the normal

distribution?

Standard deviation can be used to analyze data for any distribution curve, but it's not particularly well

suited for profiling the nonnormality of investment returns.

b. Explain why.

Those who assume that returns are normally distributed, then, run the risk of underestimating the

potential for big losses, particularly over short periods of time. That's because financial markets

exhibit what are known as fat tails.

c. Explain why.

12. Explain each of the measures of reward that can be used in a
reward-risk ratio.

13. How does the Sortino ratio overcome the limitations of the Sharpe
ratio?

14. If the minimum acceptable return that is established by a client is
the risk-free rate of return, is the Sortino ratio equivalent to the Sharpe
ratio?

15. Why is it important to understand the tails of an asset return
distribution?

16. The problem with the normal distribution is that it does not satisfy
the stability property. Explain whether you agree or disagree with this

statement.

17. In terms of the four moments of a continuous probability
distribution, what is the measure of

a. central value

b. dispersion

c. skewness

d. kurtosis

18 a. If the asset return distribution for a stock has excess kurtosis, are

the tails of this distribution more or less than the normal distribution?

b. What is the name of an asset return distribution for a stock that has excess

kurtosis?

19. a. What is meant by a stable Paretian distribution?

b. What is meant by the index of stability for a stable Paretian distribution?

20. What are the four stylized facts that have been observed for asset
return distributions?

21. What does tail probability mean?
22. Why is conditional value-at-risk a superior risk measure than
value-at-risk?

23. In studies of asset return distributions, one often sees information
about the Jarque-Bera test, the Anderson-Darling test, and the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. What is the purpose of these tests?

24. Given the following information:

Realized return = 8.5%

Risk-free rate of return = 3.2%

Standard deviation of realized returns = 5%

Minimum acceptable return = 4.2%

Standard deviation of below the minimum acceptable return = 3%

Calculate the following ratios:

a. Sharpe ratio

b. Sortino ratio

c. Information ratio

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the concept of portfolio diversification;
   - how to calculate the expected return and risk of a single asset and a
portfolio of assets;

   - portfolio theory's assumptions about how investors make decisions
and about return distributions;

   - the importance of the correlation between two assets when measuring
a portfolio's risk;

   - what is meant by a feasible portfolio and a set of feasible portfolios;
   - what is meant by the Markowitz efficient set or efficient frontier;
   - what is meant by an optimal portfolio, and how an optimal portfolio
is selected from all the portfolios available on the Markowitz efficient
frontier;

   - the criticisms of portfolio theory;
   - what behavioral finance is, and how it differs from standard finance
theory; and

   - the issues associated with the implementation of portfolio theory in
practice.

The development of the theoretical relationship between risk and expected

return is built on two economic theories, the portfolio selection theory and

capital market theory. **Portfolio theory** deals with the selection of portfolios

to maximize expected returns consistent with individually acceptable levels

- f risk. **Capital market theory** deals with the effects of investor decisions
- n security prices. More specifically, it shows the relationship that should
exist between security returns and risk if investors construct portfolios as
indicated by portfolio theory.

Together, portfolio theory and capital market theory provide a framework

to specify and measure investment risk and to develop an economic

equilibrium relationship between risk and expected return (and hence

between risk and the required return on an investment). These theories have

revolutionized the world of finance by allowing portfolio managers to

quantify the investment risk and expected return of a portfolio and by

allowing corporate treasurers to quantify the cost of capital and risk of a

proposed capital investment.

In this chapter, the focus is on portfolio theory, which covers how, under

assumed conditions, investors select the assets to be included in a portfolio.

The theory presented is referred to by various names—modern portfolio

theory, Markowitz portfolio theory, and mean-variance theory. The theory

draws on the concepts described in chapter 12. Prior to the development of

the portfolio theory presented in this chapter, investors would often speak of

risk and return, but the failure to quantify these important measures made

constructing a portfolio of assets highly subjective and provided no insight

into the return investors should expect. Moreover, investors would focus on

the risks of individual assets without understanding how combining them

into a portfolio could affect the portfolio's risk. The theories we present here

and in chapter 14 quantify the relationship between risk and expected return.

In October 1990, as confirmation of the importance of these theories, the

Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to Harry

Markowitz, [1] the developer of portfolio theory, and to William Sharpe, who is

- ne of the developers of capital market theory. [2]

Although these theories are the cornerstone of much of finance, they have

been under constant attack. This should not be surprising in the intellectual

development of any field. Portfolio theory was formulated in 1952 by

Markowitz and is still referred to as "modern" portfolio theory. Today,

special issues of journals are devoted to describing the extension of portfolio

theory as formulated by Markowitz. These extensions are not a criticism of

the intellectual contribution by Markowitz but indicate how to modify the

assumptions and deal with issues associated with implementation.

Consequently, the chapter begins with portfolio theory as formulated by

Markowitz, and the balance of the chapter is devoted to a brief description of

the extensions and implementation issues. The topic of portfolio theory goes

far beyond what is covered here and is typically reserved for a course in

investment management.

```
The Concept of Portfolio Diversification

```

Investors often talk about "diversifying" their portfolio. An investor who

diversifies is one who constructs a portfolio in such a way as to reduce

portfolio risk without sacrificing return. This goal is certainly one that

investors should seek. However, the question is how to do it in practice.

Some investors would say that including assets across all asset classes

could diversify a portfolio. For example, an investor might argue that a

portfolio should be diversified by investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate.

Although that might be reasonable, two questions must be addressed to

construct a diversified portfolio. First, how much should be invested in each

asset class? Should 40% of the portfolio be in stocks, 50% in bonds, and

10% in real estate, or is some other allocation more appropriate? Second,

- nce the allocation is determined, which specific stocks, bonds, and real
estate should the investor select?

Some investors who focus only on one asset class, such as common

stock, argue that these portfolios should also be diversified. By this they

mean that an investor should not place all of his or her investment funds in

the stock of one corporation but should invest in the stocks of many

corporations. Here, too, several questions must be answered to construct a

diversified portfolio. First, which corporations should be represented in the

portfolio? Second, how much of the portfolio should be allocated to the

stocks of each corporation?

Before the development of portfolio theory as presented in this chapter,

although investors often talked about diversification in general terms, they

did not have the analytical tools with which to answer the questions posed

above. [3] For example, in 1945, Dickson Leavens wrote:

An examination of some fifty books and articles on investment that have appeared during the last

quarter of a century shows that most of them refer to the desirability of diversification. The majority,

however, discuss it in general terms and do not clearly indicate why it is desirable. [4]

Making the assumption that risks are independent, he then shows how an

investor can benefit from diversification. What is noteworthy is his final

paragraph, in which he cautions investors that the assumption that risks are

independent for each security is important but in practice is not likely to

hold:

Diversification among companies in one industry cannot protect against unfavorable factors that may

affect the whole industry; additional diversification among industries is needed for that purpose. Nor

can diversification among industries protect against cyclical factors that may depress all industries at

the same time.

Seven years later, Harry Markowitz formulated portfolio theory, which

quantified the notion expressed in Leavens's insights using the basic

statistical concepts explained in chapter 12. [5] As we will see, the Markowitz

diversification strategy discussed in this chapter is primarily concerned with

the degree of covariance between asset returns in a portfolio as a measure of

portfolio risk, rather than with the risk of each asset in isolation.

```
Markowitz Portfolio Theory

```

When constructing a portfolio of assets, investors seek to maximize the

expected return from their investment, given some level of risk they are

willing to accept. (Alternatively stated, investors seek to minimize the risk

they are exposed to given some target expected return.) Portfolios that

satisfy this requirement are called **efficient portfolios** . Portfolio theory tells

us how to achieve efficient portfolios. Because Markowitz is the developer

- f portfolio theory, efficient portfolios are sometimes referred to as
"Markowitz efficient portfolios."

To construct an efficient portfolio of risky assets, it is necessary to make

some assumption about how investors behave when making investment

decisions. A reasonable assumption is that investors are **risk averse** . When

faced with two investments with the same expected return but two different

risks, a risk-averse investor will prefer the one with the lower risk. Given a

choice of efficient portfolios from which an investor can select, an **optimal**

**portfolio** is the one most preferred.

To construct an efficient portfolio, an investor needs to be able to

estimate the expected return for each asset that is a candidate for inclusion in

the portfolio, and not only to specify some measure of risk but also measure

that risk for each asset. As explained in chapter 12, there are different

quantitative measures of risk. The one selected in Markowitz portfolio

theory is the standard deviation (variance).

```
Expected Portfolio Return

```

The expected value of a portfolio's return (or simply, "the expected portfolio

return") is the weighted average of the expected value of the return for each

asset over the time period. Mathematically,

where

_E_ ( _Rp_ ) = expected portfolio return,

_E_ ( _Rk_ ) = expected return for asset _k_ ( _k_ = 1, …, _K_ ),

_wk_ = the weight of asset _k_ in the portfolio (i.e., the market value of asset

_k_ as a proportion of the market value of the total portfolio) at the

beginning of the period, and

_K_ = number of assets in the portfolio.

In the actual implementation of the theory, the mean return from

historical returns, adjusted where necessary by the investor, is used in

equation (13.1).

As can be seen from equation (13.1), the calculation of the expected

portfolio return is simple once the expected return for each asset is

estimated: It is simply a weighted linear combination of the assets making up

the portfolio. Measuring the portfolio's risk, however, is not as

straightforward.

```
Measuring Portfolio Risk

```

The measure of risk used in Markowitz portfolio theory is the variance, and

hence the theory is also referred to as "mean-variance" theory. Chapter 12

explained how to calculate an asset's return variance from a sample of

historical returns. Moving from the variance of individual assets to the

portfolio variance that will be the measure of portfolio risk is not as simple.

Let's begin with the simple case of the portfolio variance of a two-asset

portfolio (assets 1 and 2), which is

where

_σ_ [2] ( _Rp_ ) = portfolio variance,

_σ_ [2] ( _R_ 1), _σ_ [2] ( _R_ 2) = variance of asset 1 and asset 2, respectively,

_w_ 1, _w_ 2 = portfolio allocation (weight) of assets 1 and 2, respectively, and

cov( _R_ 1, _R_ 2) = covariance between the return for assets 1 and 2.

As can be seen from equation (13.2), the covariance between the two

assets is introduced. As explained in chapter 12, covariance is a measure of

the dependence structure or covariability between two random variables. In

- ur application, these variables are the returns for assets 1 and 2.

An alternative to measuring the covariability of two random variables is

to determine the correlation. As explained in the previous chapter, the

correlation between random variables is the covariance of the two random

variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. Applying this

formula to the returns for assets 1 and 2, we have:

cor( _R_ 1, _R_ 2) = cov( _R_ 1, _R_ 2)/[ _σ_ ( _R_ 1) _σ_ ( _R_ 2)],

where cor( _R_ 1, _R_ 2) is the correlation between the returns of assets 1 and 2.

Solving for the covariance, we have:

Substituting equation (13.3) into equation (13.2) for the covariance, the

portfolio variance can be rewritten as

```
The General Case

```

The mathematics for the two-asset case is not complicated. Moving from the

two-asset case to the general case in which there are more than two assets

gets a little trickier. For example, the three-asset case (i.e., assets 1, 2, and 3)

where the portfolio variance is defined in terms of variances and covariances

is as follows:

In general, for a portfolio with _K_ assets, the portfolio variance is given by

In equation (13.6), the _K_ variances are the cases in which _k_ = _h_ results,

and the covariance between every pair of assets is when _k_ ≠ _h_ results.

```
The Role of Correlation in Determining Portfolio Risk and the

Diversification Effect

```

Let's consider the expected portfolio return and portfolio variance using a

simple two-asset portfolio. This allows us to assess the role that the

correlation plays in determining portfolio risk. Suppose we have the

following information for the two assets, 1 and 2:

Asset _E_ ( _R_ ) _σ_ ( _R_ )

1 12% 30%

2 18% 40%

_w_

Let's assume that the portfolio has equal weights for both assets (i.e., 1

= _w_ 2). Based on this information, the expected portfolio return from equation

(13.1) is

From equation (13.4), the portfolio variance is

Taking the square root of the above equation, we obtain the standard

deviation:

We can now see how portfolio risk changes for our two-asset portfolio

with different correlations between the returns of the two assets. We know

that the correlation ranges from −1 to +1. Let's examine the following three

cases for cor( _R_ 1, _R_ 2) = −1, 0, and 1. Substituting into the equation above for

the correlations for these three cases of cor( _R_ 1, _R_ 2), we get:

cor( _R_ 1, _R_ 2) - 1 0 +1

σ( _Rp_ ) 5% 25% 35%

As the correlation between the expected returns on assets 1 and 2

increases from −1.0 to 0.0 to 1.0, the standard deviation of the expected

portfolio return increases from 5% to 35%. Note that although the portfolio

risk changes with the correlation, the expected portfolio return remains 15%

for each case.

This example clearly illustrates the effect of Markowitz diversification.

The principle of Markowitz diversification states that as the correlation

(covariance) decreases between the returns for assets that are combined in a

portfolio, so does the variance (hence the standard deviation) of the return

for the portfolio. This is the result of the degree of correlation between the

asset returns.

As can be seen, investors can construct a portfolio to maintain expected

portfolio return but lower portfolio risk by combining assets with lower (and

preferably negative) correlations. However, in practice, very few assets have

small to negative correlations with other assets. The problem, then, becomes

- ne of searching among large numbers of assets in an effort to identify the
portfolio with the minimum portfolio risk for a given level of expected
portfolio return, or, equivalently, the highest expected portfolio return for a
given level of portfolio risk.

```
Constructing Portfolios

```

Constructing a portfolio (i.e., selecting the assets and the amount allocated to

each asset), as suggested, results in portfolios that have the highest expected

return for a given level of risk. Portfolios that have this attribute are referred

to as "efficient portfolios." To construct efficient portfolios, the following

assumptions about how investors select assets are made:

    **Mean-variance assumption** : Only the expected value and the

variance are used by investors when making asset selection decisions.

    - **Risk-aversion assumption** : Investors are risk averse, which means

that when faced with a decision about which of two assets to invest in,

when both have the same expected return but different risks, investors

will prefer the asset with the lower risk.

    - **Homogeneous expectations assumption** : All investors have the

same expectations regarding expected return, variance, and covariance

for all risky assets.

    - **One-period horizon assumption** : All investors have a common oneperiod investment horizon.

    **Optimization assumption** : When constructing portfolios, investors

seek to achieve the highest expected return for a given level of risk.

The construction of efficient portfolios given the universe of potential

assets requires a massive number of calculations. For a universe of _G_ assets,

there are ( _G_ [2] - _G_ )/2 unique covariances to calculate. Hence, for a portfolio

- f just 50 assets, 1,224 covariances must be calculated. For 100 securities,
4,950 covariances must be calculated. Moreover, identifying the portfolio
that minimizes risk for each level of return requires use of an optimization
algorithm, and more specifically, quadratic programming.

Although the algorithm used to solve a quadratic programming problem

is covered in a course in management science (operations research), it is

unnecessary for appreciating how efficient portfolios are constructed.

Instead, we will just consider an example to show the results of the

- ptimization process. To do so, we will use our earlier two-asset portfolio
illustration, assets 1 and 2. Recall that for two assets, _E_ ( _R_ 1) = 12%, _σ_ ( _R_ 1) =
30%, _E_ ( _R_ 2) = 18%, and _σ_ ( _R_ 2) = 40%. In the earlier example, we did not
make any assumption about the correlation between the two assets. Here,
however, we will assume that cor( _R_ 1, _R_ 2) = −0.5. The expected portfolio
return and the standard deviation for five different portfolios (A, B, C, D,
and E) made up of varying proportions of assets 1 and 2 are shown in table

13.1.

Portfolio expected returns and standard deviations for five asset allocations for assets 1 and 2.

```
Feasible Portfolios

```

Any portfolio that an investor can construct given the universe of candidate

assets is referred to as a **feasible portfolio** . The five portfolios shown in

table 13.1 are all feasible portfolios in which the risk is measured in terms of

the portfolio's standard deviation. The collection of all feasible portfolios is

called the set of feasible portfolios, or simply the **feasible set** .

In our illustration, where only two assets are candidates for inclusion in a

portfolio, it is easy to graphically show the set of feasible portfolios. The

feasible set, shown in figure 13.1, is a curve that represents those

combinations of portfolio risk and expected portfolio return that are

attainable by constructing portfolios from all possible combinations of asset

1 and asset 2. The five portfolios in table 13.1 are identified on the curve

representing the feasible set. Beginning with portfolio A and proceeding to

portfolio E, the allocation to asset 1 goes from 100% of the portfolio to 0%,

and the allocation to asset 2 goes from 0% to 100%—therefore, all possible

combinations of asset 1 and asset 2 lie between portfolios A and E (i.e., on

the curve labeled AE in figure 13.1). In the case of two assets, any other

asset allocation to the two assets not lying on this curve is not attainable,

because there is no mix of assets 1 and 2 that can be created. It is for this

reason that curve AE is the feasible set.

```
Figure 13.1

```

Feasible and efficient portfolios for assets 1 and 2.

Figure 13.1 shows the feasible set for the two-asset case. The general

case, in which there can be more than two assets, is shown in figure 13.2. [6]

For the general asset case, the feasible set is not a curve as shown in figure

13.1 for the two-asset case but instead is an area as shown by the shaded area

in figure 13.2. The reason is that unlike in the two-asset case, it is possible to

create portfolios that result in combinations for the expected portfolio return

and portfolio risk that not only lie on curve I-II-III in figure 13.2 but also in

the shaded area.

```
Figure 13.2

```

Feasible and efficient portfolios with more than two assets.

```
Efficient Portfolios

```

An **efficient portfolio** is one that gives the highest expected return for the

feasible set of portfolios with the same risk. It is also referred to as a

**Markowitz efficient portfolio** and a **mean-variance efficient portfolio** .

For each level of portfolio risk, there is an efficient portfolio, and the

collection of all efficient portfolios is referred to as the "set of efficient

portfolios," or simply the **efficient set** - r **Markowitz efficient set** . The

efficient set is also referred to as the **efficient frontier** .

Figure 13.1 shows that part of the feasible set for our two-asset case that

represents the efficient set. Although the feasible set is shown by the curve

AE, the efficient set is the portion of the curve CE, which is part of the

feasible set. Portfolios on this portion of the curve offer the highest expected

portfolio return for a given level of portfolio risk. Of the five portfolios

shown in table 13.1, only three, portfolios C, D, and E, are part of the

efficient set. The reason for excluding the remaining two portfolios of the

feasible set from the efficient set—portfolio A, with _E_ ( _Rp_ ) = 12% and _σ_ ( _Rp_ )

= 20%, and portfolio B, with _E_ ( _Rp_ ) = 13.5% and _σ_ ( _Rp_ ) = 19.5%—is because

there is at least one portfolio among the efficient set (e.g., portfolio C) that

has a higher expected portfolio return and a lower portfolio risk than either

portfolio A or portfolio B. Also, portfolio D has a higher expected portfolio

return and a lower portfolio risk than portfolio A. In fact, the entire portion

- f the feasible set represented by curve AC is not efficient, because for any
portfolio representing a combination of expected portfolio return and
portfolio risk, there is a portfolio among the efficient set that has the same
portfolio risk and a higher expected portfolio return, or the same expected
portfolio return and a lower portfolio risk, or both. In other words, for any
portfolio among the portion of the feasible set given by curve AC (excluding
portfolio C), there exists a portfolio that _dominates_ it by having the same
expected portfolio return and a lower risk, or the same portfolio risk and a
higher expected portfolio return, or a lower portfolio risk as well as a higher
expected portfolio return. For example, portfolio D dominates portfolio A,
and portfolio C dominates both portfolios A and B.

Again, figure 13.1 represents the special case of only two assets. Figure

13.2 shows the general case. As can be seen, the efficient set is given by

curve II-III, because it can be easily observed that all feasible portfolios

represented on that portion of the curve dominate the portfolios in the shaded

area. Note that any portfolio above the efficient set cannot be constructed,

given the expected return and risk for each asset and their correlations.

```
Selecting the Optimal Portfolio

```

It makes economic sense that the portfolio that should be selected by an

investor is one on the efficient set (i.e., lies somewhere on the efficient

frontier). The efficient portfolios represent a trade-off between expected

portfolio return and portfolio risk. How does the investor select which

portfolio in the efficient set is the best one? Intuitively, it would seem that

- ne key element missing from the framework described thus far is the
investor's tolerance for risk. Well, that is precisely what is missing, and for

an investor to select the best portfolio given his or her risk tolerance, risk

must be introduced. Remember that in the Markowitz mean-variance

framework, risk is the portfolio's variance (or standard deviation) of returns.

In the economic "theory of choice," the concept used to represent a trade

- ff is an investor's utility function. This concept, first developed by John
von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, [7] comes to prominence when a
decision maker is faced with a set of choices. The decision maker in our case

is an investor, and the choices are the efficient portfolios contained in the

efficient set. So before we discuss how an investor can select a portfolio

from the efficient set, let us review the concept of a utility function.

A **utility function** assigns a (numerical) value to all possible choices

faced by a decision maker, and the larger the assigned value of a particular

choice is, the greater will be the utility derived from that choice. The

- bjective is to maximize the decision maker's utility subject to one or more
constraints. In introductory microeconomics, utility functions are used to
describe the trade-off between different consumer goods with the object of
maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint. [8] It is clear in our
application to portfolio theory that the trade-off is between a portfolio's
expected value and that portfolio's risk. The constraint imposed is that the
allocation of the portfolio's funds must be such that the weights (i.e., the _wi_
in the above equations) sum to 1.

The efficient portfolios offer different levels of portfolio expected return

and portfolio risk such that the greater the portfolio's expected return is, the

greater will be the portfolio risk. Investors are faced with the decision of

choosing one of the efficient portfolios when the portfolio's expected return

is a desirable commodity that increases the level of utility, and risk is an

undesirable commodity that decreases the level of utility. Therefore,

investors obtain different levels of utility from different combinations of

expected portfolio return and portfolio risk. The utility obtained from any

possible such combination is expressed by the utility function. Put simply,

the utility function expresses the preferences of investors for different

combinations of perceived portfolio risk and expected return.

Utility functions can be expressed mathematically. However, that is

unnecessary for our purpose, which is to understand conceptually the general

idea about how the decision is made by an investor. So instead of

mathematically expressing a utility function, we will show it graphically.

Figure 13.3 shows three curves, labeled _u_ 1, _u_ 2, and _u_ 3. By convention, the

horizontal axis measures portfolio risk, and the vertical axis measures the

portfolio expected return. Each curve represents a set of portfolios with

different combinations of portfolio risk and expected portfolio return. All

points on the same curve identify combinations of portfolio risk and

expected portfolio return that, based on the investor's preferences, offer the

same level of utility. Because they offer the same level of utility, each curve

is referred to as an **indifference curve** . For example, on the indifference

curve _u_ 1 in the figure, two points, _P_ 1 and _P_ 2, are shown. The two points

represent two portfolios, with the portfolio corresponding to _P_ 1 having a

higher portfolio expected return than the portfolio corresponding to but

also having a higher risk. Because the two portfolios lie on the same

indifference curve, the investor has an equal preference for (or is indifferent

to) the two portfolios—or, for that matter, any portfolio on the curve.

```
Figure 13.3

```

Selection of the optimal portfolio.

Notice two things about the indifference curves. First, the slope of the

indifference curve is positive, and this is so for a rational economic reason:

At the same level of utility, the investor requires a higher expected portfolio

return in order to accept higher portfolio risk. Second is the positioning of

each indifference curve. The utility the investor receives is greater the farther

the indifference curve is from the horizontal axis, because that indifference

curve represents a higher expected portfolio return at every level of portfolio

risk. Thus, for the three indifference curves shown in figure 13.3, _u_ 3 has the

highest utility and _u_ 1 the lowest.

Given a choice from the set of efficient portfolios, the **optimal portfolio**

is the one that is preferred by the investor, where preference is represented

by the investor's utility function. Figure 13.3 demonstrates graphically how

this is done. The figure shows three indifference curves representing an

investor's utility function. Also shown is the (Markowitz) efficient frontier.

From this display, it is possible to determine the optimal portfolio for the

investor with the indifference curves shown. Remember that the investor

wants to get to the highest indifference curve achievable given the efficient

frontier. In light of that requirement, the optimal portfolio is represented by

the point where an indifference curve is tangent to the efficient frontier. In

figure 13.3, that point is portfolio . For example, suppose that

corresponds to portfolio D in figure 13.1. We know from table 13.1 that this

portfolio is made up of 25% of asset 1 and 75% of asset 2, with _E_ ( _Rp_ ) =

16.5% and _σ_ ( _Rp_ ) = 27.0%.

Consequently, for the investor with preferences with respect to portfolio

expected return and portfolio risk as determined by the shape of the

indifference curves represented in figure 13.3 and expectations for asset 1

and 2 inputs (expected returns and variance-covariance) represented in table

13.1, portfolio D is the optimal portfolio, because it maximizes the investor's

utility. If this investor had a different preference for portfolio expected return

and portfolio risk, there would have been a different optimal portfolio. For

example, figure 13.4 shows the same efficient frontier but with three

indifference curves assumed by a different investor. In this case, the optimal

portfolio is, which has a lower portfolio expected return and portfolio

risk than in figure 13.3. Similarly, if the investor had a different set of

input expectations, the optimal portfolio would be different.

```
Figure 13.4

```

Selection of the optimal portfolio with different indifference curves (utility function).

At this point in our discussion, it is natural to ask: How do we estimate an

investor's utility function so that the indifference curves can be determined?

Unfortunately, there is little guidance about how to construct a utility

function. In general, economists have not successfully estimated utility

functions. The inability to estimate utility functions does not mean that the

theory is flawed. What it does mean is that once an investor constructs the

efficient frontier, the investor will subjectively determine which efficient

portfolio is appropriate in relation to his or her tolerance for risk.

```
Criticisms of Portfolio Theory

```

As formulated by Markowitz and described in the previous section, portfolio

theory is a normative theory. That is, it is a theory that describes a norm of

behavior investors should pursue when constructing a portfolio. And if

investors do follow that norm of behavior when making portfolio allocation

decisions, the portfolio selected should be an efficient portfolio. So the

criticisms of portfolio theory focus on the assumptions on which the theory

is built. After we discuss these criticisms, we'll look at the issues associated

with implementing modern portfolio theory.

Certain assumptions made in portfolio theory have been identified earlier

in the chapter: the mean-variance, risk aversion, homogeneous expectations,

- ne-period horizon, and optimization assumptions. The mean-variance,
homogeneous expectations, and one-period horizon assumptions have come
under most attack. We discuss these criticisms, and then describe an
alternative view of the investment decision-making process known as

**behavioral finance** .

The mean-variance assumption states that the appropriate measure of risk

considered by an investor is the variance of the distribution of portfolio

returns. The limitations on the use of variance as a measure of risk were

thoroughly described in chapter 12.

The homogeneous expectations assumption holds that every investor has

the same expectations about the inputs: means, variances, and correlations of

returns. Insofar as investors typically do not have access to the same data, it

is unlikely that this assumption holds. With regard to the one-period

assumption, the theory does not specify what that period is.

In addition to theoretical issues, there are practical issues associated with

implementing the mean-variance model. Specifically, estimation errors in the

forecasts significantly affect the resulting portfolio weights. Studies have

shown that estimation errors for the expected returns tend to exert more

influence than estimation errors for the variances and covariances. [9]

Furthermore, it turns out that errors in the variances are about twice as

important as errors in the covariances. [10] Hence, some portfolio managers

refer to mean-variance optimization techniques as "error maximizers" [11] that

can produce extreme or nonintuitive weights for some assets in the portfolio.

Because of estimation errors, studies have raised concerns as to whether

simply weighting each security equally in a portfolio would do as well as a

portfolio constructed by applying the Markowitz framework for determining

- ptimal weights. Several studies since the early 1980s have found that naive

diversification (i.e., an equally weighted portfolio) often outperforms

portfolios created by employing mean-variance analysis. [12]

```
Behavioral Finance Theory and Investor Decision Making

```

One of the earliest attacks on the foundations of economic principles that

financial economists use when formulating financial theories came in the

late 1970s from Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. In numerous

experiments, these two psychologists demonstrated that the actions of

decision makers are inconsistent with the assumptions made by economists.

They then formulated a theory, known as "prospect theory," that attacks

expected utility theory. [13]

Other attacks on the assumptions of standard financial theory from the

field of psychology led to the specialized field in finance known as

behavioral finance. **Behavioral finance** looks at how psychology affects

investor decisions and the implications not only for the portfolio theory we

describe in this chapter but also for asset pricing theory (explained in chapter

14), option pricing theory (explained in chapter 34), and market efficiency.

The foundations of behavioral finance lie in the research of Kahneman, Paul

Slovic, and Tversky. [14]

Hersh Shefrin notes the following three themes in the behavioral finance

literature: [15]

**Behavioral Finance Theme 1** : Investors err when making investment
decisions, because they rely on rules of thumb.

**Behavioral Finance Theme 2** : Investors are influenced by form as well
as substance when making investment decisions.

**Behavioral Finance Theme 3** : Prices in the financial market are

affected by errors and decision frames.

The first behavioral finance theme involves **heuristics** . This term means

a rule-of-thumb strategy or a good guide to follow to shorten the time it

takes to make a decision. For example, here are three rules of thumb

provided on the _MSN Money_ website for increasing the likelihood of success

when investing in common stock: (1) ignore guru predictions, (2) avoid

cheap stocks, and (3) follow the big players. [16] For retirement planning, a rule

- f thumb that has been suggested for having enough to retire is to invest
10% of annual pre-tax income. As for what to invest in to reach that
retirement goal (i.e., the allocation among asset classes), a suggested rule of
thumb is that the percentage an investor should allocate to bonds should be
determined by subtracting the investor's age from 100. So, for example, a
45-year-old individual should invest 55% of his or her retirement funds in
bonds.

These are examples of heuristics, and in some circumstances, such rules

- f thumb or quick guides can work fairly well. However, the psychology
literature tells us that heuristics can also lead to systematic biases in decision
making, or what psychologists refer to as **cognitive biases** . In the context of
finance, these biases lead to errors when making investment decisions.
Shefrin refers to these biases as **heuristic-driven biases** .

Let's recall the assumptions about investor behavior underlying modern

portfolio theory, which we referred to earlier. The first assumption, the

mean-variance assumption, is that an investor computes the mean and

variance of the return of financial assets and constructs an optimal portfolio

based on that statistical information. Behavioral finance, however, finds that

investors do not make such mean-variance calculations but instead rely on

heuristics to guide their portfolio choice.

The second behavioral finance theme involves the concept of framing.

The term **framing** as used here refers to the way in which a situation or

choice is presented to an investor. Behavioral finance asserts that the framing

- f investment choices can result in significantly different assessments by an
investor as to the risk and return of each choice and therefore the ultimate

decision made. [17] Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman provide an example of

faulty framing coupled with a cognitive bias. [18] Individual investors often fail

to treat the value of their stock portfolio at market value. Instead, investors

have a "mental account," in which they continue to mark the value of each

stock in their portfolio at the purchase price despite the change in the market

value. The reason they are reluctant to acknowledge any losses on stocks

they own is that it keeps alive the hope that those stocks will turn around to

realize a gain. When they finally sell their losing stocks, they close the

mental account, and only at that time acknowledge a loss that had hitherto

- occurred only on paper. Hence, investment decisions are affected by this
mental accounting rather than being based on the true economic impact that
an investment decision would have on the investor. Behavioral finance

assumes that such "frame dependence" plays a role in making investment

decisions, and hence the second theme of behavioral finance carries that

name. In contrast, standard finance theory assumes frame independence.

Frame independence means that investors "view all decisions through the

transparent, objective lens of risk and return." [19]

Finally, the third theme of behavioral finance shows how errors caused

by heuristics and framing dependence affect the pricing of assets. In chapter

18, we discuss the pricing efficiency of markets. According to behavioral

finance, asset prices do not reflect their fundamental value because of the

way investors make decisions. That is, markets will be price inefficient.

Hence, Shefrin labels the third behavioral finance theme "inefficient

markets."

Behavioral finance can explain investor behavior that is inconsistent with

what mean-variance analysis would suggest. Here is one example. It is

estimated that if investors follow the mean-variance framework, they should

hold more than 300 stocks. Yet it is reported that the average investor holds

- nly three or four stocks. This puzzle, labeled the **diversification puzzle**,
can be explained in the context of behavioral finance. More specifically, the
theory of portfolio selection as set forth by behavioral finance theorists,
called "behavioral portfolio theory," asserts that investors construct their
portfolios as layered pyramids. The objective of the pyramid's bottom layers
is to provide downside protection, and the objective of the pyramid's top
layers is to provide upside potential. In lieu of traditional risk aversion, in
behavioral portfolio theory, the motivation when constructing portfolios is
not the attitude of investors toward risk but rather the aspirations of
investors. In the context of behavioral portfolio theory, investors place at the
top of the pyramid a few stocks of an undiversified portfolio; other investors

- perationalize aspirations by buying lottery tickets. Either type of behavior
- n the part of investors—maintaining an undiversified portfolio or buying
lottery tickets—can be explained by behavioral portfolio theory, not by
mean-variance analysis.

That leaves us with two theories. Who is right, supporters of standard

finance theory or supporters of behavioral finance theory? In fairness, we

have not provided the responses of the supporters of standard finance theory

to the criticisms of those who support behavioral finance. Nor have we

presented the attacks on behavioral finance. Fortunately, David Hirshleifer

does provide that analysis. He describes the common objections to both

approaches. He refers to the standard finance theory as the "fully rational

approach" and behavioral finance as the "psychological approach." [20] A

criticism of both approaches is that they can go "theory fishing" to find

theories in market data to support their position. Objections to the fully

rational approach are (1) the calculations needed to implement this approach

are extremely difficult to do, and (2) the empirical evidence in the finance

literature does not support rational behavior by investors. Objections to the

psychological approach, according to Hirshleifer, are (1) alleged psychology

biases are arbitrary, and (2) the experiments performed by researchers that

find alleged psychological biases are arbitrary.

```
Key Points

```

- Portfolio theory, developed by Harry Markowitz, explains how investors
should construct efficient portfolios and select the best or optimal portfolio
from among all efficient portfolios.

   - Markowitz portfolio theory differs from previous approaches to
portfolio selection in that Markowitz demonstrated how the key
parameters to the portfolio selection problem should be measured.

   - Only two statistical moments are used to construct a portfolio,
expected return and risk as measured by the variance (or standard
deviation) of returns, and hence the technique is referred to as "meanvariance analysis."

  - A basic assumption of portfolio theory is that an investor's
preferences for portfolios with different expected returns and variances
can be represented by a function (the utility function). Another basic
assumption is that investors are risk averse.

   - The goal of diversifying a portfolio is to reduce a portfolio's risk
without sacrificing its expected return.

   - The goal of portfolio selection can be cast in terms of not just the
expected return and variance of returns but also the correlation (or
covariance) between assets.

   - A portfolio's expected return is simply a weighted average of the
expected return of each asset in the portfolio, with the weight assigned
to each asset being equal to the market value of the asset in the portfolio
relative to the total market value of the portfolio.

   - The risk of an asset is measured by the variance or standard deviation
   - f its return. Unlike the expected return, a portfolio's risk is not a
simple weighting of the standard deviation of the individual assets in
the portfolio.

   - Portfolio risk is affected by the correlation between the assets in the
portfolio: the lower the correlation is, the smaller the portfolio risk will
be.

   - A criticism of the mean-variance framework is that it ignores such
moments as skewness and fat tails that have been observed for asset

returns in real-world financial markets.

  - Proponents of behavioral finance have attacked mean-variance
analysis because in their view, investors do not make investment
decisions in the manner assumed by portfolio theory.

   - In practice, the Markowitz framework has been extended to take into
account transaction costs, tax effects when rebalancing a portfolio,
constraints, and short selling.

   - One of the most serious difficulties encountered when implementing
the Markowitz framework (as it would be for any framework requiring
estimates) is the impact of forecasts for the individual means, standard
deviations, and pairwise correlations on the portfolios generated.

   - f returns between these two asset classes is less than 1, and therefore
such a portfolio provides the benefits of diversification.

a. What does the correlation of the returns between two asset classes

measure?

b. In what sense would a correlation of return of less than 1 between stocks

and bonds suggest potential diversification benefits?

11. Suppose we have the following information for two assets, 1 and 2:

12. The following excerpt is from Warren Bailey and Rene M. Stulz:

Recent international diversification literature uses monthly data from foreign stock markets to make

the point that American investors should hold foreign stocks to reduce the variance of a portfolio of

domestic stocks without reducing its expected return. [22]

a. Why would you expect that the justification of diversifying into foreign

stock markets would depend on empirical evidence regarding the ability to

"reduce the variance of a portfolio of domestic stocks without reducing its

expected return"?

b. Typically in research papers that seek to demonstrate the benefits of

international diversification through investing in a foreign stock market, two

efficient frontiers are compared. One is an efficient frontier constructed

using only domestic stocks, the other is an efficient frontier constructed

using both domestic and foreign stocks. If benefits can be realized by

diversifying into foreign stocks, should the efficient frontier constructed

using both domestic and foreign stocks lie above or below the efficient

frontier constructed using only domestic stocks? Explain your answer.

13. The following excerpt is from John E. Hunter and T. Daniel
Coggin:

The extent to which investment risk can be diversified depends upon the degree to which national

markets were completely dominated by a single world market factor (i.e., if all cross-national

correlations were 1.00), then international diversification would have no benefit. If all national

markets were completely independent (that is, if all cross-national correlations were zero), then

international diversification over an infinite number of countries would completely eliminate the effect

- f variation in national markets. [23]

a. Why are the "cross-national correlations" critical in justifying the benefits

from international diversification?

b. Why do Hunter and Coggin argue that no benefit results from

international diversification if these correlations are all 1.00?

14. Indicate why you agree or disagree with the following statement:
"Because it is difficult to determine an investor's utility function,
Markowitz portfolio theory cannot be employed in practice to construct
a Markowitz efficient portfolio."

15. The following is an excerpt from Marshall E. Blume regarding the
Prudent Man Rule:

According to this rule, a trust manager must invest in each asset on its own merit. If each asset is safe,

then the total portfolio will be safe. For example, futures cannot be used under the Prudent Man rule

because they are inherently risky—even though investment managers now know that when futures are

combined with other assets, they can reduce portfolio risk.

….

Markowitz focused on the portfolio as a whole, not explicitly on the individual assets in the portfolio,

which was clearly at odds with the Prudent Man rule for personal trusts. In fact, under the Employee

Retirement Income Security Act passed in the mid-1970s, investing in derivatives to reduce the risk of

a portfolio was, for the most part, legally imprudent. [24]

Why is the prudent man rule for investing personal trusts in conflict with the

way to construct a portfolio as suggested by Markowitz portfolio theory?

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the assumptions underlying capital market theory;
   - the capital market line and the role of a risk-free asset in its
construction;

  - why the capital market line dominates the Markowitz efficient
frontier;

   - what the security market line is;
   - the difference between systematic and unsystematic risk;
   - the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the relevant measure of risk
in this model, and the limitations of the model;

   - what the market model is;
   - the findings of empirical tests of the CAPM and the difficulties of
testing this model;

   - the arbitrage pricing theory model;
   - the different types of factor models used in practice: statistical,
macroeconomic, and fundamental; and

   - some fundamental principles concerning risk and return that are valid
regardless of the asset pricing model used.

In chapter 13, we explained portfolio selection theory. In this chapter, we

describe capital market theory and the implications of both that theory and

portfolio theory for the pricing of financial assets. Most of this chapter

focuses on asset pricing models that are equilibrium models. Given

assumptions about the behavior and expectations of investors, and

assumptions about capital markets, these models predict the expected return

an investor should require. Thus, the models provide an answer to the

question of what risk premium an investor should demand. Knowing the

expected cash flow and the expected return, one can determine the

theoretical value of an asset; therefore, these models are referred to as "asset

pricing models."

```
Economic Assumptions

```

Economic theories are an abstraction of the real world and as such are based

- n some simplifying assumptions. These assumptions simplify matters a
great deal, and some of them may even seem unrealistic. However, they
make economic theories more tractable from a mathematical standpoint.
Some of the assumptions discussed in this chapter are precisely those
criticized by proponents of behavioral finance. It should be noted that
although we call these assumptions "behavioral assumptions," they are the
behavioral assumptions made by standard finance, or what we mentioned in
the previous chapter as the fully rational approach. They are not the
assumptions of those who advocate behavioral finance.

```
Assumptions about Investor Behavior

```

When constructing a portfolio of risky assets, capital market theory makes

the following assumptions about the behavior of investors.

**Behavioral Assumption 1** : Capital market theory assumes that
investors make investment decisions based on two parameters: the
expected return and the variance of returns. Portfolio theory, described
in chapter 13, is sometimes referred to as a mean-variance model. This
assumption tells us what investors use as inputs when making their
investment decisions. Their specific behavior follows from the
assumption that to accept greater risk, they must be compensated by the

   - pportunity of realizing a higher return. We refer to such investors as
risk averse. This definition is oversimplified. A more rigorous
definition of risk aversion is described by a mathematical specification

   - f an investor's utility function. However, this complexity need not
concern us here. What is important is that an investor who faces a
choice between two portfolios with the same expected return will (it is
assumed) select the portfolio with the lower risk.

**Behavioral Assumption 2** : Capital market theory assumes that the
risk-averse investor subscribes to the method of reducing portfolio risk
by combining assets with counterbalancing correlations, as explained in
chapter 13.

**Behavioral Assumption 3** : Capital market theory assumes that all
investors make investment decisions over some single-period

investment horizon. The length of that period (six months, one year,

two years, etc.) is not specified. In reality, the investment decision

process is more complex, with many investors looking at more than one

investment horizon. Nonetheless, the assumption of a one-period

investment horizon is necessary to simplify the mathematics of the

theory.

**Behavioral Assumption 4** : Capital market theory assumes that all
investors have the same expectations with respect to the inputs that are
used to derive the Markowitz efficient portfolios, namely, asset returns,
variances, and correlations. This is the homogeneous expectation
assumption.

```
Assumptions about Capital Markets

```

The four behavioral assumptions listed above deal with the behavior of

investors when making investment decisions. It is also necessary to make

assumptions about the characteristics of the capital market in which

investors transact. The three assumptions in this regard are as follows.

**Capital Market Assumption 1** : Capital market theory assumes that the
capital market is perfectly competitive. In general, the number of
buyers and sellers is sufficiently large, and all investors are small
enough relative to the market, that no individual investor can influence
an asset's price. Consequently, all investors are price takers, and the
market price is determined where supply equals demand.

**Capital Market Assumption 2** : Capital market theory assumes that no
transaction costs or impediments interfere with the supply and demand
for an asset. Economists refer to these various costs and impediments as
"frictions." The costs associated with frictions generally result in buyers
paying more than they would in the absence of frictions and sellers
receiving less. In the case of financial markets, frictions include
commissions charged by brokers and the bid-ask spreads charged by
dealers. They also include taxes and government-imposed transfer fees.

**Capital Market Assumption 3** : Capital market theory assumes that a
risk-free asset exists in which investors can invest. Moreover, it

assumes that investors can borrow funds at the same interest rate

   - ffered on that risk-free asset. That is, it assumes that investors can lend

and borrow at some risk-free rate.

```
Capital Market Theory

```

According to portfolio theory as formulated by Markowitz, an investor

should create a portfolio with the highest expected return for a given level of

risk, where risk is measured by the portfolio's variance. In chapter 13, we

did not consider the possibility of constructing efficient portfolios in the

presence of a risk-free asset, that is, an asset whose return is known with

certainty.

In the absence of a risk-free rate, portfolio theory tells us that Markowitz

efficient portfolios can be constructed by using expected portfolio return and

portfolio variance. Once a risk-free asset is introduced, and assuming that

investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate (capital market

assumption 3), the conclusion of portfolio theory can be qualified as

illustrated in figure 14.1. Every combination of the risk-free asset and the

Markowitz efficient portfolio _M_ is shown on the tangent line in the figure.

This line is drawn from the vertical axis as the risk-free rate tangent to the

Markowitz efficient set, also referred to as the "efficient frontier." The point

- f tangency is denoted by _M._ All portfolios on the line are feasible for the
investor to construct. Portfolios to the left of _M_ represent combinations of
risky assets and the risk-free asset. Portfolios to the right of _M_ include
purchases of risky assets made with funds borrowed at the risk-free rate.

```
Figure 14.1

```

The capital market line.

_Note:_ Portfolios to the right of _M_ are leveraged portfolios (borrowing at the risk-free rate to buy a

market portfolio). Portfolios to the left of _M_ are combinations of the risk-free asset and the market

portfolio.

Now let's compare a portfolio on the line to the portfolio on the

Markowitz efficient frontier with the same risk. As an example, we'll

compare portfolio _PA,_ which is on the Markowitz efficient frontier, with

portfolio _PB,_ which is on the line and therefore has some combination of the

risk-free rate and the Markowitz efficient portfolio _M._ Notice that for the

same risk, the expected return is greater for _PB_ than for _PA._ In fact, this

dominance is true for all but one portfolio on the line, portfolio _M,_ which is

- n the Markowitz efficient frontier.

Recognizing this preference, we must modify the conclusion from

portfolio theory that an investor will select a portfolio on the Markowitz

efficient frontier, depending on the investor's level of risk aversion. With the

introduction of the risk-free asset, we can now say that an investor will select

a portfolio on the line representing a combination of borrowing or lending at

the risk-free rate and purchases of the Markowitz efficient portfolio _M._ The

particular efficient portfolio that the investor will select on the line depends

- n the investor's risk preference.

Several studies have demonstrated that the opportunity to borrow or lend

at the risk-free rate implies a capital market in which risk-averse investors

will prefer to hold portfolios consisting of combinations of the risk-free asset

and some portfolio _M_ - n the Markowitz efficient frontier. [1] Sharpe called the

line from the risk-free rate to portfolio _M_ - n the efficient frontier the **capital**

**market line** (CML), the name adopted by the industry.

One more key question remains: How does an investor construct

portfolio _M_ ? Eugene Fama answered this question by demonstrating that _M_

must consist of all assets available to investors, and each asset must be held

in proportion to its market value relative to the total market value of all

assets. [2] So, for example, if the total market value of some asset is \$500

million and the total market value of all assets is $X, then the percentage of

the portfolio that should be allocated to that asset is \$500 million divided by

$X _._ Because portfolio _M_ consists of all assets, it is referred to as the **market**

**portfolio** .

Now we can restate how a risk-averse investor who makes investment

decisions as suggested by portfolio theory and who can borrow and lend at

the risk-free rate should construct efficient portfolios. This process combines

an investment in the risk-free asset with the market portfolio. The theoretical

result that all investors will hold a combination of the risk-free asset and the

market portfolio is known as the **two-fund separation theorem**, [3] with one

fund consisting of the risk-free asset and the other consisting of the market

portfolio. Although all investors will select a portfolio on the CML, the

- ptimal portfolio for a specific investor is the one that will maximize that
investor's risk preference.

```
Deriving the Formula for the CML

```

Figure 14.1 graphically shows us the CML, but we can derive a formula for

the CML algebraically as well. This formula will be key to achieving our

goal of showing how a risky asset should be priced.

To derive the formula for the CML, we combine the two-fund separation

theorem with the assumption of homogeneous expectations (behavioral

assumption 4). Suppose an investor creates a two-fund portfolio: a portfolio

consisting of _wF_ invested in the risk-free asset and _wM_ invested in the market

portfolio, where _w_ represents the corresponding percentage (weight) of the

portfolio allocated to each asset. Thus,

_wF_ + _wM_ = 1, or _wF_ = 1 − _wM._

What are the expected return and the risk of this portfolio? As we

explained in chapter 13, the expected return is equal to the weighted average

- f the two assets. Therefore, for our two-fund portfolio, the expected
portfolio return, _E_ ( _Rp_ ), is equal to

_E_ ( _Rp_ ) = _wF_ _RF_ + _wME_ ( _RM_ ).

Because we know that _wF_ = 1 − _wM_, we can rewrite _E_ ( _Rp_ ) as follows:

_E_ ( _Rp_ ) = (1 − _wM_ ) _RF_ + _wM_ _E_ ( _RM_ ),

which can be simplified to

Now that we know the expected return of our hypothetical portfolio, we

turn to the portfolio's risk as measured by the variance of the portfolio. We

know from equation (13.4) how to calculate the variance of a two-asset

portfolio. We repeat equation (13.4) here:

We can use this equation for our two-fund portfolio. Asset 1 in this case is

the risk-free asset _F_, and asset 2 is the market portfolio _M._ Then,

We know that the variance of the risk-free asset, _σ_ [2] ( _RF_ ), is equal to zero,

because no possible variation in the return results when the future return is

known. The correlation between the risk-free asset and the market portfolio,

cor ( _RF_, _RM_ ), is zero, because the risk-free asset has no variability and

therefore does not move at all with the return on the market portfolio, which

is a risky asset. Substituting these two values into the formula for the

portfolio's variance results in the following:

In other words, the variance of the two-fund portfolio is represented by the

weighted variance of the market portfolio. We can solve for the weight of the

market portfolio by substituting standard deviations for variances.

Because the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, we can

write:

## σ ( Rp ) = wM σ ( RM )

and therefore

_wM_ = _σ_ ( _Rp_ )/ _σ_ ( _RM_ )

Now let's return to equation (14.1) and substitute for _wM_ the result we just

derived:

Rearranging, we get

This equation yields the CML.

```
Interpreting the CML Equation

```

Capital market theory assumes that all investors hold the same expectations

for the inputs into the model (behavioral assumption 4). With homogeneous

expectations, _σ_ ( _RM_ ) and _σ_ ( _Rp_ ) are the market's consensus for the expected

return distributions for the market portfolio and portfolio _p._ The slope of the

CML is given by

Let's examine the economic meaning of the slope. The numerator is the

expected return of the market beyond the risk-free return. It provides a

measure of the risk premium, or the reward for holding the risky market

portfolio rather than the risk-free asset. The denominator is the risk of the

market portfolio. Thus, the slope measures the reward per unit of market

risk. Because the CML represents the return offered to compensate for a

perceived level of risk, each point on the line is a balanced market condition,

- r equilibrium. The slope of the line determines the additional return needed
to compensate for a unit change in risk. For this reason, the slope of the
CML is also referred to as the **market price of risk** .

The CML says that the expected return on a portfolio is equal to the riskfree rate plus a risk premium. As noted in chapter 13, we seek a measure of

the risk premium. According to capital market theory, the risk premium is

equal to the market price of risk times the quantity of risk for the portfolio

(as measured by the standard deviation of the portfolio). That is,

_E_ ( _Rp_ ) = _RF_ + Market price of risk × Amount of portfolio risk.

```
The Capital Asset Pricing Model

```

Up to this point, we know how a risk-averse investor who makes decisions

based on two parameters, risk and expected return, should construct an

efficient portfolio: by using a combination of the market portfolio and the

risk-free rate. Based on this result, we can derive a model that shows how a

risky asset should be priced. In the process of doing so, we can refine our

thinking about the risk associated with an asset. Specifically, we can show

that the appropriate risk that investors should be compensated for accepting

is not the variance of an asset's return but some other quantity. To illustrate,

we need to take a closer look at portfolio risk.

```
Systematic and Unsystematic Risk

```

In Markowitz portfolio theory, variance of return is the measure of risk used.

This risk measure can be decomposed into two general types of risk:

systematic risk and unsystematic risk.

**Systematic risk** is the portion of an asset's return variability that can be
attributed to a common factor. It is also called **undiversifiable risk** .

Systematic risk is the minimum level of risk that can be obtained for a

portfolio by means of diversification across a large number of randomly

chosen assets. Thus, systematic risk results from general market and

economic conditions that cannot be diversified away.

The portion of an asset's return variability that can be diversified away is

referred to as **unsystematic risk** . It is also sometimes called **diversifiable**

**risk**, **residual risk**, **idiosyncratic risk**, or **company-specific risk** . This is

the risk that is unique to a company, such as a strike, an unfavorable

- utcome of litigation, or a natural catastrophe. Some examples of this type of
risk in real life are the product tampering involving Tylenol capsules

(manufactured by Johnson & Johnson) in October 1982 and the chemical

accident at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in December 1984.

Both of these unforeseeable and hence unexpected tragedies negatively

affected the stock prices of the two companies involved.

Figure 14.2 depicts how diversification reduces unsystematic risk for

portfolios as more securities are added to a portfolio. It shows total portfolio

risk declining as the number of holdings increases. Increasing diversification

gradually tends to eliminate unsystematic risk, leaving only systematic risk.

The remaining variability results from the fact that the return on nearly every

security depends to some degree on the overall performance of some

common factor, and that common factor is the general market. Consequently,

the return on a well-diversified portfolio is highly correlated with the market,

and its variability or uncertainty is basically the uncertainty of the market as

a whole. For this reason, systematic risk is also referred to as **market risk** .

Investors are exposed to market risk no matter how many stocks they hold,

which is why systematic risk is referred to as "nondiversifiable risk."

```
Figure 14.2

```

Systematic and unsystematic portfolio risk.

Empirical studies of returns from investing in common stocks support

these statements about systematic and unsystematic risk. The major findings

- f the studies on the impact of diversification on the risk of a portfolio of
common stock are as follows:

1. The average return is unrelated to the number of issues in the
portfolio, yet the standard deviation of return declines as the number of
holdings increases.

2. At a portfolio size of about 20 randomly selected common stocks,
the level of total portfolio risk is reduced such that what is left is
systematic risk.

3. For individual stocks, the average ratio of systematic risk to total
risk is about 30%.

4. On average, approximately 40% of the single-security risk is
eliminated by forming randomly selected portfolios of 20 stocks.

5. The return on a diversified portfolio follows the market closely, with
the ratio of systematic risk to total risk exceeding 90%.

**`Quantifying systematic risk`** Systematic risk can be quantified by
dividing security return into two parts: one part perfectly correlated with and
proportional to the market return and a second part independent from
(uncorrelated with) the market. The first component of return is usually
referred to as "systematic return" and the second as "unsystematic return" or
"diversifiable return." Thus we have the following:

As the systematic return is proportional to the market return, it can be

expressed as the symbol beta ( _β_ ) times the market return, _RM_ . The

proportionality factor beta is a **market sensitivity index**, indicating how

sensitive the security return is to changes in the market level. (How to

estimate beta for a security or portfolio will be discussed later.) The

unsystematic return, which is independent of market returns, is usually

represented by the symbol epsilon followed by a prime ( _ε_ ′). Thus, the

security return, _R_, may be expressed as

For example, if a security has a beta of 2.0, then a 10% market return will

generate a 20% systematic return for the stock. The security return for the

period would be the 20% plus the unsystematic component. The

unsystematic component depends on factors unique to the company, such as

labor difficulties, higher than expected sales, and so on.

The security returns model given by equation (14.4) is usually written in

_ε_

such a way that the average value of the residual term, ′, is zero, by adding

a factor, alpha ( _α_ ), to the model to represent the average value of the

unsystematic returns over time. That is, we set _ε_ ′ = _α_ + _ε_ so that [4]

where the averages over time should tend to zero.

The model for security returns given by equation (14.5) is usually

referred to as the **market model** . Graphically, the model can be depicted as a

line fitted to a plot of security returns against rates of return on the market

index, as shown for a hypothetical security in figure 14.3.

```
Figure 14.3

```

Graphical depiction of the market model.

_Note:_ Beta ( _β_ ), the market sensitivity index, is the slope of the line. Alpha ( _α_ ), the average of the

residual returns, is the intercept of the line on the security axis. The epsilon primes ( _ε_ ′), the residual

returns, are the perpendicular distances of the points from the line.

The beta factor can be thought of as the slope of the line. It gives the

expected increase in security return for a 1% increase in market return. In

_on_

figure 14.2, if a security has a beta of 1.0, a 10% market return will result,

_average_, for a 10% security return.

The alpha factor is represented by the intercept of the line on the vertical

(security return) axis. It is equal to the average value over time of the

unsystematic returns ( _ε_ ′) on the stock. For most stocks, the alpha factor tends

to be small and unstable.

Using the definition of security return given by the market model, the

specification of systematic and unsystematic risk is straightforward—they

are simply the standard deviations of the two return components. [5]

The systematic risk of a security is equal to beta times the standard

deviation of the market return:

The unsystematic risk equals the standard deviation of the residual return

factor, _ε_ :

Given measures of individual security systematic risk, we can now

compute the systematic risk of the portfolio. It is equal to the beta factor for

the portfolio, _βp_, times the risk of the market index, _σ_ ( _RM_ ):

The portfolio beta factor in turn can be shown to be simply an average of

the individual security betas, weighted by the proportion of each security in

the portfolio:

_βp_ = _w_ 1 _β_ 1 + _w_ 2 _β_ 2 + … + _wnβn_,

- r more concisely:

where

_wi_ = the proportion of portfolio market value represented by security _i,_

_n_ = the number of securities.

Thus, the systematic risk of a portfolio is simply the market value

weighted average of the systematic risk of the individual securities. It

follows that the beta for a portfolio consisting of all securities is 1. If a

stock's beta exceeds 1, it is above the average. If the portfolio is composed

- f an equal dollar investment in each security, the _βp_ is simply an unweighted
average of the component security betas.

The unsystematic risk of the portfolio is also a function of the

unsystematic security risks, but the form is more complex. [6] The important

point is that with increasing diversification, this risk approaches zero.

With these results for portfolio risk, it is useful to return to the studies of

the impact of diversification on risk. One study compared the standard

deviation for 20-stock portfolios with the predicted lower limits based on

average security systematic risks.

The lower limit is equal to the average beta for the portfolio times the

standard deviation of the market return. The standard deviations in all cases

studied were close to the predicted values. These results support the

contention that portfolio systematic risk equals the average systematic risk of

the component securities.

The implications of these results are substantial. First, we would expect

realized rates of return over long periods to be related to the systematic risk

as opposed to the total risk of securities. As the unsystematic risk is

relatively easily eliminated, we should not expect the market to offer

investors a "risk premium" for bearing such risk. Second, because security

systematic risk is equal to the security beta times _σ_ ( _RM_ ), which is common

to all securities, beta is useful as a _relative_ risk measure. The _β_ gives the

systematic risk of a security (or portfolio) relative to the risk of the market

index. Thus, it is often convenient to speak of systematic risk in relative

terms, that is, in terms of beta rather than beta times _σ_ ( _RM_ ).

**`Estimating beta`** The beta of a security or portfolio can be estimated by
estimating the market model given by equation (14.5) using regression
analysis applied to historical returns. The estimated slope for the market
model is the estimate of beta. A series of returns is computed over some time
interval for some broad market index (such as the S&P 500 stock market
index) and for the stock (or portfolio). [7] For example, monthly returns can be
calculated for the past five years, providing 60 return observations for both
the market index and the stock or portfolio. Or weekly returns can be
calculated for the past year. Nothing in financial theory indicates whether
weekly, monthly, or even daily returns should be used. Nor does theory
indicate any specific number of observations, except that statistical
methodology indicates that more observations give a more reliable measure

- f beta. [8]

Beta estimates are available on the Internet from Yahoo Finance and

Google Finance for individual stocks. Table 14.1 shows the estimates of beta

from the Yahoo Finance web site for five stocks as reported on August 3,

2018. Yahoo Finance uses monthly price changes for the company's stock

and the monthly change of the S&P 500 index. Three years of returns (36

months) are used (when available).

```

Coca-Cola Co. (KO) 0.53

General Dynamics (GD) 0.85

Netflix Inc (NFLX) 1.39

Fedex Corp (FDX) 1.53

Our purpose here is not to provide an explanation of the mechanics of

calculating beta but to point out the practical problems in estimating beta.

(Other econometric issues are involved, but we do not focus on these.) The

difference in the calculated beta will depend on the following factors:

   - the length of time over which a return is calculated (e.g., daily,
weekly, monthly);

   - the number of observations used (e.g., three years of monthly returns
   - r five years of monthly returns);
   - the specific period used; and
   - the market index selected (e.g., the S&P 500 stock market index or an
index consisting of all stocks traded on exchanges, weighted by their
relative market value).

Moreover, the question arises of the stability of beta over different time

intervals. That is, does the beta of a stock or portfolio remain relatively

unchanged over time, or does it change? The interesting question concerns

the economic determinants of the beta of a stock. The risk characteristics of

a company should be reflected in its beta. Several empirical studies have

attempted to identify these macroeconomic and microeconomic factors.

```
The Security Market Line

```

The CML represents an equilibrium condition in which the expected return

- n a _portfolio_ - f assets is a linear function of the expected return on the
market portfolio. A directly analogous relationship holds for _individual_
_security_ expected returns:

Equation (14.10) simply uses risk and return variables for an individual

security in place of the portfolio values in the equation for the CML given by

equation (14.2). This version of the risk-return relationship for individual

securities is called the **security market line** (SML). As in the case of the

CML, the expected return for an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus the

product of the market price of risk and the quantity of risk in the security.

Another more common version of the SML relationship uses the beta of a

security. To see how this relationship is developed, let's look back at

equation (14.3). In a well-diversified portfolio (i.e., Markowitz diversified),

the unique or unsystematic risk is eliminated. Consequently, it can be

demonstrated that

and the standard deviation is

Therefore,

If _βi_ is substituted into equation (14.10), we have the beta version of the

SML, as shown in equation (14.11), popularly referred to as the **capital asset**

**pricing model** (CAPM): [9]

This equation states that, given the assumptions of capital market theory

described earlier, the expected (or required) return on an individual asset is a

positive linear function of its index of systematic risk as measured by beta.

The larger beta is, the higher will be the expected return. Notice that it is

- nly an asset's beta that determines its expected return.

Let's look at the prediction of the CAPM for several values of beta. The

beta of a risk-free asset is zero, because the variability of the return of a riskfree asset is zero and therefore it does not covary with the market portfolio.

So, if we want to know the expected return for a risk-free asset, we would

substitute zero for _β_ 1 in equation (14.11):

_E_ ( _Ri_ ) = _RF_ + 0[ _E_ ( _RM_ ) − _RF_ ] = _RF._

Thus, the return on a risk-free asset is simply the risk-free return, as

expected.

The beta of the market portfolio is 1. If asset _i_ has the same beta as the

market portfolio, then substituting 1 into equation (14.11) gives

_E_ ( _Ri_ ) = _RF_ + 1[ _E_ ( _RM_ ) − _RF_ ] = _E_ ( _RM_ ).

In this case, the expected return for the asset is the same as the expected

return for the market portfolio. If an asset has a beta greater than the market

portfolio (i.e., greater than 1), then the expected return will be higher than

for the market portfolio. The reverse is true if an asset has a beta less than

the market portfolio. A graph of the SML is presented in figure 14.4.

The SML, CML, and Market Model

```

In equilibrium, the expected return of individual securities will lie on the

SML and not on the CML because of the high degree of unsystematic risk

that remains in individual securities, a risk that can be diversified out of

portfolios of securities. It follows that the only risk investors will pay a

premium to avoid is market risk. Hence, two assets with the same amount of

systematic risk will have the same expected return. In equilibrium, only

efficient portfolios will lie on both the CML and the SML, which

underscores the fact that the systematic risk measure, beta, is most correctly

considered to be an _index_ - f the contribution of an individual security to the

systematic risk of a well-diversified portfolio of securities.

It is important to point out the difference between the market model and

the CML and SML. The CML and the SML represent a predictive model for

expected returns. The market model is a descriptive model used to describe

historical data. Hence, the market model makes no prediction of what

expected returns should be.

```
Tests of the CAPM

```

The CAPM is indeed a simple and elegant model, but these qualities do not

in and of themselves guarantee that it will be useful for explaining observed

risk/return patterns. Here we briefly review the empirical literature on

attempts to verify the model.

The major difficulty in testing the CAPM is that the model is stated in

terms of investors' expectations and not in terms of realized returns. To test

the CAPM, it is necessary to convert the theoretical CAPM given by

equation (14.11) to a form that can be tested empirically. We will not go

through this exercise here but will simply provide the model that is typically

tested. Nor will we delve into the econometric problems associated with

testing the CAPM, although we discuss later in this chapter an important

theoretical issue that raises serious questions about the testability of the

CAPM and therefore the empirical findings of researchers.

The empirical analogue of equation (14.11) asserts that over the period of

time analyzed, (1) a linear relationship exists between the average risk

premium return on the market and the average risk premium return on a

stock or portfolio, and its slope is _βi_ ; and (2) the linear relationship should

pass through the origin. Moreover, according to the CAPM, beta is a

complete measure of a stock's risk. Consequently, alternative risk measures

that might be proposed (the most common being the standard deviation of

return) should not be significant contributors to the explanation of a stock's

return. Recall that the standard deviation measures a stock's total risk, which

includes both systematic and unsystematic components.

The CAPM holds for both individual securities and portfolios. Therefore,

the empirical tests can be based on either. Tests based on individual

securities, however, are not the most efficient method of obtaining estimates

- f the magnitude of the risk/return trade-off, for two reasons.

The first problem is called the "errors in variables bias" and results from

the fact that the beta of a stock typically is measured by correlating the

stock's return over some sample of historical data. The slope of the resulting

line (the regression coefficient) is the estimate of beta. It is subject to errors

from various sources. These errors are random in their effect; that is, some

stocks' betas are overestimated and others are underestimated. Nevertheless,

when these estimated beta values are used in the test, the measurement errors

tend to attenuate the relationship between average return and risk. By

carefully grouping the securities into portfolios of securities with similar

betas, much of this measurement error problem can be eliminated. The errors

in individual stocks' betas cancel out, so that the portfolio beta can be

measured with much greater precision. In turn, tests based on portfolio

returns will be more efficient than tests based on security returns.

The second problem relates to the obscuring effect of residual variation.

Realized security returns include a large random component, which typically

accounts for about 70% of the variation of return (the diversifiable or

unsystematic risk of the stock). By grouping securities into portfolios, we

can eliminate much of this "noise" and thereby get a much clearer view of

the relationship between return and systematic risk.

It should be noted that grouping does not distort the underlying

risk/return relationship. The relationship that exists for individual securities

is exactly the same for portfolios of securities.

The major results of the empirical tests conducted in the early 1970s are

summarized as follows:

1. The evidence shows a significant positive relationship between
realized returns and systematic risk as measured by beta. The average
market risk premium estimated is usually less than predicted by the
CAPM, however.

2. The relationship between risk and return appears to be linear. The
studies give no evidence of significant curvature in the risk/return

relationship.

3. Tests that attempt to discriminate between the effects of systematic
and unsystematic risk do not yield definitive results. Both kinds of risk
appear to be positively related to security returns, but substantial
evidence supports the proposition that the relationship between return
and unsystematic risk is at least partly spurious—that is, partly a
reflection of statistical problems rather than the true nature of capital
markets.

Obviously, we cannot claim that the CAPM is absolutely right. But the

early empirical tests do support the view that beta is a useful risk measure

and that high-beta stocks tend to be priced so as to yield correspondingly

high rates of return.

In 1977, however, Richard Roll wrote a paper criticizing the previously

published tests of the CAPM. [10] Roll argued that although the CAPM is

testable in principle, no correct test of the theory had yet been presented. He

also argued for the practical impossibility that a correct test would ever be

accomplished in the future.

The reasoning behind Roll's assertions revolves around his contribution

that only one potentially testable hypothesis is associated with the CAPM,

namely, that the true market portfolio lies on the Markowitz efficient frontier

(i.e., it is mean-variance efficient). Furthermore, because the true market

portfolio must contain all worldwide assets, the value of most of which

cannot be observed (e.g., human capital), the hypothesis is in all probability

untestable. [11]

Since 1977, some studies have purported either to support or to reject the

CAPM. These tests attempt to examine implications of the CAPM other than

the linearity of the risk/return relation as the basis of their methodology.

Unfortunately, none provides a definitive test, and most are subject to

substantial criticism, suffering from the same problem of identifying the

"true" market portfolio.

```
The Arbitrage Pricing Theory Model

```

An alternative model to the CAPM was developed by Stephen A. Ross in

1976. [12] This model is based purely on arbitrage arguments and hence is

called the **arbitrage pricing theory (APT) model** .

The APT model postulates that a security's expected return is influenced

by a variety of factors, as opposed to just the single market index of the

CAPM. Specifically, look back at equation (14.5), which states that the

return on a security is dependent on its market sensitivity index and an

unsystematic return. In contrast, the APT states that the return on a security

is linearly related to _H_ "factors." The APT does not specify what these

factors are, but it is assumed that the relationship between security returns

and the factors is linear.

To illustrate the APT model, let us assume a simple world with a

portfolio consisting of three securities with two factors (otherwise, more

complicated mathematical notation must be introduced). The following

notation is used:

= the random rate of return on security _i_ ( _i_ = 1, 2, 3),

_E_ ( _Ri_ ) = the expected return on security _i_ ( _i_ = 1, 2, 3),

_Fh_ = the _h_ th factor that is common to the returns of all three assets ( _h_ =

1, 2),

_βi_, _h_ = the sensitivity of the _i_ th security to the _h_ th factor, and

= the unsystematic return for security _i_ ( _i_ = 1, 2, 3).

The APT model asserts that the random rate of return on security _i_ is

given by the following relationship:

For equilibrium to exist among these three assets, the following arbitrage

condition must be satisfied: using no additional funds (wealth) and without

increasing risk, it should not be possible, on average, to create a portfolio to

increase return. In essence, this condition states that no "money machine" is

available in the market. Ross showed the following risk and return

relationship results for each security _i_ :

where

_βi_, _Fj_ = the sensitivity of security _i_ to the _j_ th factor,

_E_ ( _RFj_ ) − _RF_ = the excess return of the _j_ th systematic factor over the riskfree rate and can be thought of as the price (or risk premium) for the _j_ th

systematic risk.

Equation (14.12) can be generalized to the case that includes _H_ factors as

follows:

_E_ ( _Ri_ ) = _RF_ + _βi_, _F_ 1[ _E_ ( _RF_ 1) − _RF_ ] + _βi_, _F_ 2[ _E_ ( _RF_ 2) − _RF_ ] + … + _βi_, _FH_ [ _E_ ( _RFH_ ) − _RF_ ].

(14.14)

Equation (14.14) is the APT model. It states that investors want to be

compensated for all the factors that _systematically_ affect the return of a

security. The compensation is the sum of the products of each factor's

systematic risk, _βi_, _Fh_, and the risk premium assigned to it by the market,

_E_ ( _RFh_ ) − _RF_ . As in the case of the two other risk and return models described

earlier, an investor is not compensated for accepting unsystematic risk.

```
Comparison of the APT Model and CAPM

```

Examining the equations, we can see that the CAPM, equation (14.11), is a

special case of the APT model, equation (14.14):

CAPM: _E_ ( _Ri_ ) = _RF_ + _βi_ [ _E_ ( _RM_ ) − _RF_ ].

APT: _E_ ( _Ri_ ) = _RF_ + _βi_, _F_ 1[ _E_ ( _RF_ 1) − _RF_ ] + _βi_, _F_ 2[ _E_ ( _RF_ 2) − _RF_ ] + … + _βi_, _FH_ [ _E_ ( _RFH_ ) −

_RF_ ].

```
Advantages of the APT Model

```

Supporters of the APT model argue that it offers several major advantages

- ver the CAPM. First, it makes less restrictive assumptions about investor
preferences concerning risk and return. As explained earlier, the CAPM
theory assumes that investors trade off risk and return solely on the basis of
the expected returns and standard deviations of prospective investments. In
contrast, the APT model simply requires some rather unobtrusive bounds be
placed on potential investor utility functions.

Second, no assumptions are made about the distribution of security

returns. Finally, because the APT model does not rely on the identification of

the true market portfolio, the theory is potentially testable.

```
Factor Models in Practice

```

Thus far we have presented the APT, which tells us how a security should be

priced based on its exposure to various types of risk. In practice, three types

- f factor models are used to evaluate common stock: statistical factor

models, macroeconomic factor models, and fundamental factor models. [13]

```
Statistical Factor Models

```

As just discussed, identifying the factors presents certain difficulties. In a

**statistical factor model**, historical and cross-sectional data on stock returns

are tossed into a statistical model. The statistical model used is principal

components analysis, which is a special case of a statistical technique called

"factor analysis." The goal of the statistical model is to best explain the

- bserved stock returns with "factors" that are linear return combinations and

are uncorrelated with one another.

For example, suppose that the monthly returns for 1,500 companies for

10 years are computed. The goal of principal components analysis is to

produce factors that best explain the observed stock returns. Let's suppose

that six factors provide explanations. These factors are statistical artifacts.

The objective in a statistical factor model then becomes to determine the

economic meaning of each of these statistically derived factors.

Because of the problem of interpretation, it is difficult to use the factors

from a statistical factor model to obtain expected returns. Instead,

practitioners prefer two other models, which allow them to prespecify

meaningful factors and thus produce a more intuitive model.

```
Macroeconomic Factor Models

```

In a **macroeconomic factor model**, the inputs to the model are historical

stock returns and observable macroeconomic variables called "raw

descriptors." The goal is to determine which macroeconomic variables are

pervasive in explaining historical stock returns. Those variables that are

pervasive in explaining the returns are then the factors included in the

model. The responsiveness of a stock to these factors is estimated using

historical time series data. The sensitivity of the factors is estimated so that

they are statistically independent. Then there will be no double counting.

An example of a macroeconomic factor model for the U.S. equity market

is the Burmeister, Ibbotson, Roll, and Ross model. [14] This model has five

macroeconomic factors that reflect unanticipated changes in the following

macroeconomic variables: investor confidence (confidence risk), interest

rates (time horizon risk), inflation (inflation risk), real business activity

(business cycle risk), and market index (market timing risk).

```
Fundamental Factor Models

```

Probably the most popular models are fundamental factor models, which use

company and industry attributes and market data as raw descriptors.

Examples of the descriptors used include price/earnings ratios, book/price

ratios, estimated economic growth, and trading activity. The inputs into a

fundamental factor model are stock returns and the potential raw descriptors

about a company. Those fundamental variables about a company that are

pervasive in explaining stock returns and make economic sense are then the

factors retained in the model. The sensitivity of a stock's return to a factor is

estimated using statistical analysis.

There are several third-party vendors who have created fundamental

factor models. In a series of academic papers, Eugene Fama and Kenneth

French have shown that the following five factors should be included in a

factor model. In their original paper, they showed that a three-factor model

that included the market (as measured by beta and as suggested by the

CAPM), size (as measured by market capitalization), and value (as measured

by the book-to-value ratio) explained the returns on stocks better than the

CAPM did. [15] That is, they added two factors to the CAPM. More recently,

they showed that by including two additional factors—measures of

profitability and investment—their five-factor model outperformed their

three-factor model in explaining returns. [16] Several asset management firms

have suggested additional factors. [17]

```
Some Principles to Take Away

```

In this chapter and the previous one, we have covered the heart of what is

popularly called "modern portfolio theory" and APT. We pointed out the

assumptions and their critical role in the development of these theories and

explained the empirical findings. Even though you should now understand

the topics covered, you might still be uncomfortable as to where we have

progressed, given the lack of theoretical and empirical support for the

CAPM and the difficulty of identifying the factors in the APT model. You

are not alone: A good number of practitioners and academics feel

uncomfortable with these models, particularly with the CAPM.

Nevertheless, comfort comes from several general principles about risk

and return derived from these theories that few would question:

1. Investing has two dimensions, risk and return. Therefore, focusing

   - nly on the actual return that an investor achieves without looking at
the risk that was accepted to achieve that return is inappropriate.

2. It is also inappropriate to look at the risk of an individual asset when
deciding whether it should be included in a portfolio. What is important
is how the inclusion of an asset in a portfolio will affect the risk of the
portfolio.

3. Whether investors consider one risk or 1,000 of them, risk can be
divided into two general categories: systematic risk (which cannot be
eliminated by diversification) and unsystematic risk (which can be
diversified away).

4. Investors should only be compensated for accepting systematic risks.
Thus, when formulating an investment strategy, it is critical to identify
the systematic risks.

```
Key Points

```

- Capital market theory is based on a set of behavioral assumptions and
market assumptions.

   - If investors select portfolios as assumed by portfolio theory, and if a
risk-free asset is introduced, a new set of efficient portfolios can be
constructed that represents a combination of a risk-free asset and the
market portfolio.

   - The risk of an asset's return as measured by its variance can be
broken down into systematic risk and unsystematic risk.

- The portion of an asset's return variability that can be attributed to a
common factor is its systematic risk.

- Because systematic risk cannot be diversified away, it is referred to as
"undiversifiable risk," and in the case where this is one source of risk, it

is called "market risk."

- Because a portfolio's systematic risk cannot be eliminated, it is the
minimum level of risk that can be obtained by means of diversification
across many randomly chosen assets.

- Unsystematic risk is the portion of an asset's return variability that
can be diversified away and is referred to as "diversifiable risk." Other
names for unsystematic risk are residual risk, idiosyncratic risk, and
company-specific risk.

- The beta of an asset is a measure of sensitivity to the market and
therefore is a relative measure of systematic risk.

- An asset's beta is estimated using regression analysis on data
- btained from historical returns for the asset and some market index.
- The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an economic theory that
describes the relationship between risk and expected return.
Equivalently, it is a model for the pricing of risky securities.

- The CAPM asserts that the only risk priced by rational investors is
systematic risk, because that risk cannot be eliminated by
diversification.

- Essentially, the CAPM says that the expected return of a security or a
portfolio is equal to the rate on a risk-free security plus a risk premium.

- The risk premium in the CAPM is the product of the quantity of risk
times the market price of risk.

- The beta of a security or portfolio is an index of the systematic risk of
the asset and is estimated statistically.

- Beta is calculated from historical data on both the asset's return and

the market's return.

- Numerous empirical tests of the CAPM, in general, fail to fully
support the theory.

   - Richard Roll criticized studies of the CAPM because of the difficulty
   - f identifying the true market portfolio and argued that such tests are
not likely to appear soon, if at all.

  - The CAPM assumes that investors are concerned with only one
source of risk: the risk having to do with the future price of a security.
However, other risks include the capacity of investors to consume
goods and services in the future.

   - The arbitrage pricing theory (APT), developed purely from arbitrage
arguments, postulates that the expected return on a security or a
portfolio is influenced by several factors.

   - Proponents of the APT model cite its less restrictive assumptions as a
feature that makes it more appealing than the CAPM.

   - Testing the APT model does not require identification of the "true"
market portfolio. But it does require empirical determination of the
factors, because they are not specified by the theory.

  - The APT model replaces the problem of identifying the market
portfolio in the CAPM with the problem of choosing and measuring the
underlying factors.

   - One of the most popular factor models is the Fama-French five-factor
model.

   - Although the theories presented are controversial or difficult to
implement in practice, several principles are not controversial and can
be used to understand how to price financial assets.

24. The equation here is the one used in William F. Sharpe, "A Simplified Model for Portfolio
Analysis," _Management Science_ 9, no. 2 (1963): 277–293. Some vendors and academics use as the
variables the excess returns in calculating beta. The excess return is found by subtracting a suitable
risk-free rate from the asset's return and from the market's return. This is referred to as the "risk
premium" form of the market model.
25. The relationship between the risk components is given by _σ_ [2] ( _Rp_ ) = _β_ [2] _σ_ [2] ( _RM_ ) + _σ_ [2] ( _ε_ ′).

This follows directly from equation (14.5) and the assumption of statistical independence of _RM_

and _ε_ ′. The _R_ [2] term previously discussed is a ratio of systematic to total risk (both measured in terms

- f variance):

6. Assuming the unsystematic returns ( _ε_ ′) of securities to be uncorrelated (reasonably true in practice),
the unsystematic portfolio risk is given by

where is the unsystematic risk for stock _i._ Assume that the portfolio is made up of an equal

percentage invested in each security and that _σ_ [2] ( _ε_ ′) is the average value of the Then _wi_ = 1/ _n_,

and

which—assuming _σ_ [2] ( _ε_ ′) is finite—obviously approaches zero as the number of issues in the

portfolio increases.

7. We discuss several broad market indexes in chapter 22.
8. This assumes that the economic determinants that affect the beta of a stock do not change over the
measurement period.

9. The model is sometimes stated in risk premium form. Risk premiums, or excess returns, are

- btained by subtracting the risk-free rate from the rate of return. The expected security and market risk
premiums—designated _E_ ( _ri_ ) and _E_ ( _rM_ ), respectively—are given by

_E_ ( _ri_ ) = _E_ ( _Ri_ ) − _RF_,

_E_ ( _rM_ ) = _E_ ( _RM_ ) − _RF_ .

Substituting these risk premiums into equation (14.11), we obtain:

_E_ ( _ri_ ) = _βi_ [ _E_ ( _rM_ )].

In this form, the CAPM states that the expected risk premium for the investor's portfolio is equal to

its beta value times the expected market risk premium. Or, equivalently stated, the expected risk

premium should be equal to the quantity of risk (as measured by beta) and the market price of risk (as

measured by the expected market risk premium).

10. Richard Roll, "A Critique of the Asset Pricing Theory: Part 1. On the Past and Potential
Testability of the Theory," _Journal of Financial Economics_ 4 (1977): 129–176.

11. The hypothesis tested in the traditional tests of the CAPM cited earlier—namely, that a linear
relationship exists between average security returns and beta values—sheds no light on the question.
This result follows, because an approximately linear relation between risk and return would be
achieved in tests involving large, well-diversified common stock portfolios, irrespective of whether
securities were priced according to the CAPM or some totally different model. The result is
tautological. The fact that a positive relationship between realized returns and betas is typically found
simply indicates that the returns on the proxy indexes used for the true market portfolio are larger than
the average return to the global minimum-variance portfolio.

- what is meant by a quantitative easing monetary policy and a
negative interest rate policy; and

- the historical interest rate levels in the United States.

An **interest rate** is the percentage of the amount loaned that the borrower

agrees to pay the lender in a loan agreement each year. For example, suppose

that a bank agrees to loan a consumer \$20,000 for four years and the lending

arrangement calls for an interest rate of 5% per year and repayment of the

loan amount (\$20,000) at the end of the four years. Then each year, the

consumer pays interest to the bank of 5% times the \$20,000, or \$1,000, per

year. Basically, an interest rate is the cost of borrowing money from a lender

and the compensation to the lender for loaning money. This concept of an

interest rate is not new to modern economies. Interest rates have a long

history. Here is a sample of estimated interest rates over the past 5,000 years:

20% in Mesopotamia (around 3000 BC), Babylon (1772 BC), and Italian

cities (about AD 1150); about 8% in Rome in 443 BC, Athens and Rome ca.

300–200 BC, Holland in the 1570s, and the United States in the 1870s. Since

2008 (the beginning of the global financial crisis), interest rates around the

world have been at historically low levels. In fact, in some countries, interest

rates have been negative! That is, the borrower is charging the lender for

holding money.

In this chapter, we describe a theory of interest rates that offers an

explanation of what determines the level of interest rates. In doing so, we

focus on the one interest rate that can be said to provide the anchor for other

rates—the short-term, riskless, real rate. By **real rate**, we mean the rate that

would prevail in the economy if price levels remained constant and were

expected to be constant indefinitely. We then look at three important issues.

The first is what is meant by a riskless interest rate. Is there a financial

instrument that provides a positive interest rate without any risk? Second, we

look at negative interest rates and discuss whether there is a lower bound on

that rate. Finally, we look at alternative interest rates measures that can be

used as the benchmark interest rate in the economy. In chapter 16, we

describe the structure of interest rates. There is no single interest rate for all

loan arrangements in an economy. The interest rate offered on a particular

loan depends on a myriad of factors related to the type of borrower (the

issuer in the case of a bond), the characteristics of the loan arrangement, and

the state of the economy.

```
Fisher’s Theory of Interest Rates

```

To understand what determines the basic rate, we must inquire why some

people might decide not to consume all their current resources (i.e., to save)

and why others want to invest. Those desirous of borrowing might want to

use the proceeds either to make further loans (i.e., acquire financial assets)

- r to invest (i.e., acquire income-yielding physical assets, such as a plant,
equipment, or residential structures). In our discussion, we abstract from
financial intermediaries and assume that all loans directly or indirectly end
up being transferred to an investor.

Economists have developed theories of interest rates. The major theories

were formulated in the books written by two economists: an Austrian

economist, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, in 1884, [1] and an American economist,

Irving Fisher, in 1930. [2] We'll start with the theory of interest rates as set

forth by Fisher and then explain Böhm-Bawerk's theory. [3]

To begin, let's define what is meant by "saving." Saving reflects

primarily the choice between current consumption and future consumption.

To understand that choice (and all consumer choices), we need to consider

two fundamental concepts: preference and opportunity.

```
Preferences for Current versus Future Consumption

```

Consider first the representation of preferences. Suppose that our consumer

is to choose among a variety of "baskets" (or "bundles"), where each basket

consists of a certain quantity of current consumption and a certain quantity

- f future consumption.

Preferences (or tastes) can then be described fully by a complete

preference ranking of all the relevant baskets. Insofar as the amount of

current and future consumption can vary by any small dose, some choices

among the possible baskets will be ranked equally; that is, the consumer will

be indifferent as to certain choices among baskets.

This consideration makes it possible to obtain an effective representation

- f preference, as shown in figure 15.1. The figure measures current
consumption ( _C_ 1) along the horizontal axis and future consumption ( _C_ 2)
along the vertical axis. Hence, any point in the diagram represents a
commodity basket, such as _H_ . Some other point, _H_ *, represents an
indifferent choice to _H_ ; more generally, a curve from _H_ to _H_ - and beyond

consists of baskets indifferent to both _H_ and _H_ *. Such a curve is called an

**indifference curve** . The indifference curve in figure 15.1 is labeled _u_ .

```
Figure 15.1

```

Indifference curve between current and future consumption.

Note that an indifference curve goes through every point in the diagram,

although the indifference curves cannot intersect, because that would imply

that a given basket is ranked both higher and lower than another—a clear

_u_

inconsistency. The indifference curve here falls from left to right, because

both consumption now and consumption later can be taken to be desirable.

As basket _H_ in figure 15.1 includes more current consumption than basket

_H*_, for it to be indifferent from basket _H_ *, basket _H_ must have less future

consumption, _C_ 2.

The reason the curve is drawn convex with respect to the origin is the

assumption that, as the consumer gives up successive equal amounts of

current consumption, more future consumption will be needed to make up

for the loss of an additional unit. This assumption appears reasonable,

although a complete justification of it is beyond the scope of this chapter

At any point on an indifference curve, we can draw a tangent to the

curve. Fisher refers to the slope of this tangent as the **marginal rate of time**

**preference** . It measures how much additional consumption next period is

needed to compensate the consumer for the loss of a unit of consumption

now. That is, the slope of the tangent measures the marginal rate of

substitution between current and future consumption.

We might conjecture that a particular person would be impatient to

consume now rather than later, and therefore it would take more than one

unit tomorrow to induce that person to give up the enjoyment of one unit

today. In other words, the marginal rate of time preference, or the slope of

the indifference curve, would be larger than 1. For this reason, Fisher

proposed labeling the excess of the slope over unity a "measure of

impatience."

It turns out, however, that this conjecture about the slope is wrong. It is

easy to verify that the slope of the indifference curve changes as we move

along it, and therefore that it is most unlikely to be everywhere greater than

unity. On the left side of the diagram, where today's endowment is small, the

slope can be counted on to be larger than unity. However, as we move to the

right, and the current endowment grows larger relative to the future one, the

slope must become smaller than 1, meaning that the consumer may be

willing to give up a unit of today's abundant supply for less than one unit to

add to tomorrow's scarce supply. This insight is important for understanding

why interest rates can in principle be negative.

```
Opportunity in the Loan Market

```

To understand saving behavior, we need to look at how preferences interact

with opportunities. Let's first consider a case in which the opportunities (or

baskets among which a person can choose) are defined by (1) an initial

endowment of the commodity now and later and (2) a loan market where

individuals are free to exchange this initial or current endowment for a

_R_ = 1 + _r_

different one by lending or borrowing at a fixed exchange rate of

units of the commodity in the next period (i.e., the future in our illustration)

per unit of the commodity loaned in the current period. _R_ is the gross return

_r_

(principal plus interest), and is the net return, or interest rate. For example,

if a unit of current consumption is loaned at 5%, then _r_ = 0.05 and _R_ = 1.05.

We represent this opportunity locus in figure 15.2 by means of the

_mm_

negatively sloped straight line going through the endowment basket at

point _B_ (with current endowment as _Y_ 1 and future endowment as _Y_ 2). We

refer to the opportunity locus in the loan market as the "market line." It

slopes downward, because to get more _C_ 1, you must reduce _C_ 2. It is a

straight line, because at any point on it, by giving up one unit of current

consumption, we can get the same additional amount, _R_, of future

consumption. And it goes through _B_, because if no lending made current

consumption equal to the current endowment of _Y_ 1, then future consumption

would equal the future endowment of _Y_ 2. Thus, the opportunity locus must

include point _B_ .

```
Figure 15.2

```

Representation of opportunity locus in the loan market (the market line).

Now let us add to the diagram a family of indifference curves, as shown

in figure 15.3. One curve in the diagram is tangent to the market line, such as

curve _u_ 4 at point _D_ . The consumption basket corresponding to point _D_ can

be shown to be the preferred one among all those available, given the market

line; hence it will be the chosen basket.

```
Figure 15.3

```

Family of indifference curves and the market line.

Following this logic, suppose the consumer started by considering point

_H_ - n indifference curve _u_ 2, where current consumption is greater than at _D_ .

Suppose next he considered giving up some current consumption in favor of

more future consumption along his market opportunity line. He would first

reach point _F_ and would find it a preferable choice, being on a higher

indifference curve, _u_ 3. Continuing, he would reach point _D_ - n _u_ 4, offering

yet higher utility. But beyond _D_, he would immediately start reaching lower

and lower utility curves, such as curves _u_ 2 and _u_ 3. We see that the point of

tangency of the market line to an indifference curve provides the best of all

feasible choices.

Recalling that the slope of an indifference curve at any point measures

the marginal rate of substitution between current and future consumption, we

see that at the chosen point, the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the

market rate _R_ (or the marginal rate of impatience, equal to _r_ ). It is an

important property of a perfect market that, because everybody is confronted

with the same market rate _r_, everybody at the chosen point must exhibit the

_r_

same degree of impatience. In particular, if is positive (as it generally is in

- ur type of economy), everybody will be impatient; that is, everybody will
be willing to give up a unit of current consumption to lend more only if they
can get 1 + _r_ units later, with _r_ - 0, because that opportunity is offered by the
market.

```
Economic Forces Affecting the Market Rate

```

So far, we have assumed that the market rate _r_ is a given. But what in fact

determines _r_ in this simple economy? The answer, of course, is demand and

supply. For any given market rate, _R_, each person will decide how much to

consume now and how much to save or dissave (the difference between the

current endowment and consumption). In this simple economy, saving or

dissaving is the same as lending or borrowing. By summing up the net

lending of each participant, for each _R_, we obtain a supply curve for loans,

such as the one graphed in figure 15.4. We draw it as initially rising from left

to right, on the commonly held assumption that net lending will rise as _R_

rises. For sufficiently low _R_, net lending is negative, because borrowing

would exceed lending. We'll suppose zero investment at the outset. Then

market equilibrium requires that net lending be zero. It therefore occurs at

point _E_, where the curve cuts the horizontal axis. (Note that we draw the net

lending curve as declining in the rightmost section. We discuss the reason for

this behavior later.)

```
Figure 15.4

```

Supply curve for loans.

The market rate _R_ reflects two major forces: the time preferences of

participants and their endowments. More impatience tends to make for a

smaller supply of loans (saving) at any given _R_ and to lower the supply

curve in figure 15.4, thereby shifting _E_ to the right. A large endowment of

the current commodity relative to the future makes people more eager to

lend, raises the curve, and thus reduces _R_ . If the curve is raised sufficiently,

_E_ may be pushed to the left until it is less than unity, and therefore _r_ will

become negative. This point may seem paradoxical, but it is important to

understand that no opportunity of transferring resources to the future through

investment (or money, which is disregarded) exists outside of lending and

borrowing.

```
Carryover through Investment

```

We now enlarge the model to allow for the possibility of investments—a

productive process through which, by using current resources as an input, we

- btain an output of future commodities. An investment opportunity locus
might look something like the curve _tt_ in figure 15.5, which is referred to as
the **transformation curve** - r the **production function** . It rises from left to
right on the assumption that as more is invested, more future output will
result. It is convex from below on the customary assumption of decreasing

returns to scale (although increasing returns are possible in some regions

without changing the argument). The slope of the transformation curve

measures the **marginal productivity of capital** .

```
Figure 15.5

```

Opportunity locus from investment (transformation curve or production function).

```
Consumer Choices

```

The consumer faces several decisions regarding (1) how much to invest, (2)

how much to lend (or borrow), and (3) how much to consume now and later.

But only two of these choices are independent: Because current resources

are given, once a person has decided how much to consume and invest, net

lending will be determined uniquely by income minus the two other

expenditures. Similarly, net borrowing and investment, together with the

future endowment, uniquely fix future consumption.

Let's consider first the decision as to how much to invest. As the

consumer's "income" (or what she has available to spend on consumption

now and later) is limited by the sum of her endowment and any profits she

may derive from her production opportunity, a necessary condition to

achieve the best feasible consumption is to ensure for herself as large a profit

as possible. To see how this result can be achieved, look again at figure 15.5.

Recall that profit at any output (or input) is the difference between the output

produced with the input (or investment) and the cost of the input. The output

for any investment is given by the curve _tt_ in figure 15.5.

What about the cost? Let us suppose initially that the owner of a firm

must borrow the entire amount needed to finance the investment. In that

case, clearly the cost of any given investment will be what is to be repaid

next period, namely, the amount borrowed times the gross market rate _R_ .

This cost can be represented in figure 15.6 by a straight line with slope _R_

going through the origin, and as shown in figure 15.6 by the line _MM_ . Thus,

the profit for any output is the difference between the curve _tt_ and the line

_MM_, which is illustrated in figure 15.6 for an assumed investment of We

refer to the line _MM_ in the figure as the "cost line." Because it represents the

cost of borrowing, however, it has the same slope (in absolute value) as the

market line in figure 15.2.

```
Figure 15.6

```

Measuring the profit from investing.

As the consumer increases investment from an investment of zero (at the

- rigin), we can see from the graph that profits initially rise (provided there
are profits at all). The additional profit attributable to increased investment
gets smaller and smaller, though, until it reaches a point in the figure of no
more incremental profit. This point is shown as point _A_ in figure 15.7. If the
consumer continues to expand investment still further, the profit (as
measured by the vertical distance between the cost line _MM_ and the
transformation curve _tt_ ) becomes smaller and smaller. Point _A_ 's one
distinguishing characteristic is that it is where the curve _tt_ has precisely the

same slope _R_ as the cost curve _MM_, as shown in figure 15.8. We draw

through _A_ a line _mm_ with the same slope as _R_ (and hence parallel to _MM_ ).

This line is tangent to _tt_ at _A_ .

```
Figure 15.7

```

Profit maximization point.

```
Figure 15.8

```

Profit maximization and the cost line.

Because the slope of _tt_ represents the marginal productivity of capital, we

can conclude that the optimum rate of investment for the firm is where the

marginal productivity of capital _M_ equals the market gross rate _R_ - r,

equivalently, where the additional output that can be obtained from an

additional unit of input is just equal to the cost of borrowing that additional

unit of input (and the amount obtained by further increases in investment is

less than the cost of borrowing).

We can now proceed to examine the consumption decision and its

interaction with the investment decision. To this end, we first show in figure

15.9 how the transformation curve, curve _tt_ in figure 15.5, would be
represented if graphed on the earlier figures 15.1 through 15.3. We obtain the
transformation curve (production function), curve _tt_, in figure 15.9 by
rotating the curve _tt_ in figure 15.5 by 180 degrees and shifting the origin to
point _B_, which represents the initial endowment as in figure 15.2. The
resulting curve is the locus of all achievable baskets of current and future
commodity available to the person through a combination of the initial
endowment and the transformation opportunity.

```
Figure 15.9

```

Transformation curve imposed on current and future consumption graph.

The amount invested is shown in figure 15.9 along the horizontal axis by

the difference between the current endowment _Y_ 1 and the point on the

horizontal axis corresponding to any point on the transformation curve,

which is illustrated in figure 15.10. At point _W_, the corresponding value on

the horizontal axis is _I_ _[W]_, and the amount of the investment is the difference

between _Y_ 1 and _I_ _[W]_ . Future consumption corresponding to the point _W_ - n the

transformation curve is which consists of the future endowment _Y_ 2 plus

the profit from the investment as measured by the difference between and

_Y_ 2.

```
Figure 15.10

```

Measuring investment and profit from investment.

Suppose for a moment that no market permitted an exchange of _C_ 1 with

_C_ 2. Then the curve _tt_ in figure 15.10 would represent the household

- pportunity locus. The person's best choice, the basket ( _C_ 1, _C_ 2), would then
be found at a point of tangency of that curve with an indifference curve. But
in a market economy, the budget constraint does not come from the initial
endowment _B_ in figure 15.2, or from the initial endowment enlarged by the
transformation function, as in figure 15.9, but instead from the endowment
plus the profit that can be earned through the production and sale of _C_ 2. It

follows that to maximize satisfaction, the individual's should, to begin with,

maximize the profits obtained from the transformation activity. This

maximization will yield a new budget equation that includes the best choice

- f basket ( _C_ 1, _C_ 2).

This optimal decision is shown graphically in figure 15.11. Point _A_  - n the

transformation function curve _tt_ is such that the slope is equal to the slope of

the market line _mm_ . We know that this point (which corresponds to point _A_

in figure 15.8) represents the amount of investment and output

_A_ _mm_

that will maximize profits. Through point, a new budget line (again

tangent to _tt_ at _A_ ) represents the outcome of adding maximum profits to the

endowment in figure 15.11. The utility-maximizing basket will then be at a

point of tangency of this profit-augmented budget line to an indifference

curve, such as point _C_ [0] .

```
Figure 15.11

```

Optimal investment and borrowing decisions.

A most important property resulting from the existence of a perfect loan

market, together with a transformation, is that it separates the current

consumption decision from current income by opening up the possibility of

saving and dissaving through transformation and net lending. Similarly, it

frees the investment from the saving decision, as the person can bridge the

gap between saving and investment through lending and borrowing. In the

specific case graphed in figure 15.11, we find that the chosen consumption

is less than the initial endowment _Y_ 1, so the person saves an amount

shown in the figure. But that amount is not sufficient to finance an optimal

investment equal to the distance between _Y_ 1 and _IA_ - f the chosen production.

Hence the difference is made up by borrowing, as indicated in the

figure.

Figure 15.11 illustrates how a rational person can both save and borrow.

Many other combinations can work out by varying the position of the chosen

points _A_ and _C_ [0] relative to each other and to the endowment basket _B_ as

well. For example, if _A_ falls between _C_ [0] and _B_, the person ends up saving

more than she needs for her investment, and thus she will save, invest, and

lend. However, if _C_ [0] falls to the right of _B_, the person will dissave, but she

can invest at the same time by borrowing the sum of her investment and

dissaving.

Incidentally, it should be apparent by now that we can drop our initial

assumption that the investment is financed entirely by borrowing, because, if

it were financed by the owner's own saving, the cost to the investor of the

funds would still be _R_ per unit, which is the amount of interest that would

have to be forgone to shift funds from making loans in the market to

financing the investment (the opportunity cost).

```
Market Equilibrium

```

So far, we have discussed how a person responds in terms of saving,

investing, and borrowing to a given market _R_ . But what determines _R_ itself?

The answer once again is demand and supply; that is, the price must be such

as to clear the market. The situation we described needs to clear two

markets. The first market for loans _R_ must be such that gross lending equals

gross borrowing, or, equivalently, that net borrowing is zero. The second

market is the market for the current commodity. The two sources of demand

for it are consumption and investment, and _R_ must be such that aggregate

consumption ( _C_ ) plus aggregate investment ( _I_ ) equals the given endowment

( _Y_ ). Thus, _C_ + _I_ = _Y_, or, equivalently, _I_ = _Y_ - _C_ = _S._

Consequently, _R_ must be such that the demand for investment equals the

economy's net saving, denoted by _S_ . But how can _R_ clear two markets at the

same time? One variable cannot satisfy two equations at the same time,

_unless_ - ne is redundant in the sense that the two provide identical solutions.

Indeed, it happens that the two market-clearing conditions here are

redundant. To see why, recall that the decisions of each individual must

satisfy a "budget constraint"; that is, a person's net lending must equal the

excess of her saving over her investment. If we sum up this constraint over

the entire market, we get _L_ = _S_ - _I_, where _L_ is net lending.

It is apparent from this equation that if an interest rate clears the

commodity market by making _S_ = _I_, then that same rate makes _L_ = 0, or

clears the loan market. Thus, we can conclude that the equilibrium _R_ must

equate the supply of saving and the demand for investment, or, equivalently,

the demand for and supply of loanable funds. If we want to graph the

mechanism determining _R_, it will be more enlightening to use the

commodity market (i.e., saving equals investment).

Equilibrium in this market is represented graphically in figure 15.12,

where the rising curve plots the supply of saving, analogous to _LL_ in figure

15.4. The investment function is drawn to decline uniformly with _R_ . The

justification for this choice can be found in figure 15.8. We have shown that

the investment chosen is at the point where the transformation curve has

slope _R_ . If _R_ rises to _R_ 1, then the investment must shift to a point where the

slope is _R_ 1; and because _R_ 1 is larger than _R_, the transformation curve at _R_ 1

must be steeper. But because of the convexity of the transformation curve, it

can occur only if investment is to the left of the initial level, that is, smaller.

The market-clearing interest rate is then at the intersection of the saving and

investment functions, where the two are equal.

```
Figure 15.12

```

Market equilibrium.

It is also apparent from figure 15.12 that, as long as the intersection

- ccurs in a region where the saving rises with _R_, the market-clearing interest
rate will be higher, the higher the investment function is. As can be seen in
figure 15.13, a shift of the investment function up and to the right (meaning
more demand for investment at any given _R_ ) will raise the interest rate and
result in increased saving and investment. Similarly, an increased propensity
to save—a shift of the saving curve up and to the left, as shown in figure
15.14—will reduce the interest rate and result in saving and investment,
although by less than the shift, because the lower _R_ will have a depressing
effect on saving.

Change in _I_, _S_, and _R_ if saving function increases.

The basic conclusion is that the interest rate reflects a complex set of

forces that controls the demand for investment and the supply of saving.

These forces are discussed extensively elsewhere, and we do not examine

them here except for setting out a representative catalog of relevant factors:

the rate of growth of population and productivity; fiscal policy, including

incentives to save and invest; demographic variables; the role of bequests;

the nature of technological progress; and the openness of international

capital markets.

```
The Loanable Funds Theory of Interest Rates

```

Fisher's theory is a general one and obviously neglects certain practical

matters, such as the power of the government (in concert with depository

institutions) to create money and the government's often large demand for

borrowed funds, which is frequently immune to the level of the interest rate.

Also, Fisher's theory does not consider the possibility that individuals and

firms might invest in cash balances. Expanding Fisher's theory to encompass

these situations produces the **loanable funds theory of interest rates** .

This theory proposes that the general level of interest rates is determined

by the complex interaction of two forces. The first is the total demand for

funds by firms, governments, and households (or individuals), which carry

- ut a variety of economic activities with those funds. This demand is
negatively related to the interest rate (except for the government's demand,
which frequently may not depend on the level of the interest rate). If income
and other variables do not change, then an increase in the interest rate will
reduce the demand for borrowing on the part of many firms and individuals,
as projects become less profitable, and consumption and holding cash grow
more costly. The second force affecting the level of the interest rate is the
total supply of funds by firms, governments, banks, and individuals. Supply
is positively related to the level of interest rates, if all other economic factors
remain the same.

With rising rates, firms and individuals save and lend more, and banks

are more eager to extend more loans. (A rising interest rate probably does

not significantly affect the government's supply of savings.) In an

equilibrium, the intersection of the supply and demand functions sets the

interest rate level and the level of loans. In equilibrium, the demand for

funds equals the supply of funds. In this case, all agents are borrowing what

they want, investing to the desired extent, and holding all the money they

wish to hold. In other words, equilibrium extends through the money market,

the bond market, and the market for investment assets.

As in Fisher's theory of interest rates, shifts in the demand and supply

curves may occur for many reasons: changes in the money supply,

government deficits, changed preferences by individuals, new investment

- pportunities, and so on. These shifts affect the equilibrium level of the
interest rate and of investment in predictable ways. Finally, the expectation

- f inflation can affect the equilibrium rate through the supply of funds curve,
as savers demand higher rates (because of inflation) for any level of savings.
Note that this analysis has excluded the question of default on loans: the rate
discussed is the risk-free rate, either in its nominal rate or real rate (nominal
and real rates are discussed below).

```
The Liquidity Preference Theory of Interest Rates

```

The liquidity preference theory, originally developed by John Maynard

Keynes, [4] analyzes the equilibrium level of the interest rate through the

interaction of the supply of money and the public's aggregate demand for

holding money. Keynes assumed that most people hold wealth in only two

forms: "money" and "bonds." For Keynes, "money" is equivalent to

currency and demand deposits, which pay little or no interest but are liquid

and can be used for immediate transactions. Bonds represent a broad

Keynesian category and include long-term, interest-paying financial assets

that are not liquid and that pose some risk, because their prices vary

inversely with the interest rate level. Bonds may be liabilities of

governments or firms. (Default risk is not considered here, and the rate is the

risk-free rate, in real or nominal form.)

The public (consisting of individuals and firms) holds money for several

reasons: ease of transactions, precaution against unexpected events, and

speculation about possible rises in the interest rate. Although money pays no

interest, the demand for money is a negative function of the interest rate. At

a low rate, people hold a lot of money, because they do not lose much

interest by doing so and because the risk of a rise in rates (and a fall in the

value of bonds) may be large. With a high interest rate, people desire to hold

bonds rather than money, because the cost of liquidity is substantial in terms

- f lost interest payments and because a decline in the interest rate would lead
to gains in the bonds' values. The negative linkage between the interest rate
and the demand for money appears as curve _D_ in figure 15.15, which relates
the interest rate to the amount of money in the economy, given the level of
income and expected price inflation.

```
Figure 15.15

```

Equilibrium in Keynes's market for money.

For Keynes, the supply of money is fully under the control of the central

bank (the Fed in the United States). Moreover, the money supply is not

affected by the level of the interest rate. Thus, the supply of money appears,

in figure 15.15, as the vertical line, _MS_, and the line above the _MS_ indicates

a quantity that does not vary with the interest rate. Of course, equilibrium in

the money market requires that the total demand for money equals total

supply. In figure 15.15, equilibrium implies an interest rate of _i_ .

Furthermore, equilibrium in the money market implies the equilibrium of the

bond market.

The equilibrium rate of interest can change if there is a change in any

variable affecting the demand or supply curves. On the demand side, Keynes

recognized the importance of two such variables: the level of income and the

level of prices for goods and services. A rise in income (with no other

variable changing) raises the value of money's liquidity and shifts the

demand curve to the right, increasing the equilibrium interest rate. Because

people want to hold amounts of "real money" (or monetary units of specific

purchasing power), a change in expected inflation would also shift the

demand curve to the right and raise the level of interest.

The money supply curve can shift, in Keynes's view, only by actions of

the central bank. The central bank's power over interest rates arises because

- f its ability to buy and sell securities (open market operations), which can
alter the amount of money available in the economy. Generally, Keynes
thought that an increase in the money supply would, by shifting the supply
curve to the right, bring about a decline in the equilibrium interest rate.
Similarly, he reasoned that a reduction in the money supply would raise
rates. However, there is now widespread recognition that the question of
linkage between the money supply and the level of the interest rate is rather
more complex than that.

In a comprehensive analysis of this theory, it can be shown that the

impact of a change in the money supply can affect the level of interest rates

through a liquidity effect, an income effect, and a price expectations effect.

Their impact on interest rates will depend on relative magnitudes, based on

the level of economic activity at the time of the change in the money supply.

Böhm-Bawerk’s Positive Theory of Capital

```

Forty years before Irving Fisher formulated his theory of interest rates as

described in this chapter, the Austrian economist Eugen Böhm von Bawerk

set forth his theory of interest rates and why interest rates must be positive. It

would seem to make sense that his theory should be presented first.

However, in the almost 500 pages of his book _Positive Theory of Capital_,

- nly two figures appear, and both have limited value in understanding his
theory. This is the reason that Robert Shiller, when describing the BöhmBawerk's theory, wrote: "This was not Mathematical Economics. It was
Literary Economics." [5] And when contrasting the theory by Böhm-Bawerk
and Fisher, Paul Samuelson wrote that Böhm-Bawerk "was not quite able to

formulate his intuitive vision in terms that would satisfy today's persnickety

jury of theorists." [6]

We will now describe Böhm-Bawerk's theory of the determinants of

interest rates and why they must be positive. [7] The theory set forth by BöhmBawerk, as with the theory by Fisher, emphasizes the importance of time as

the primary factor affecting interest rates. Böhm-Bawerk offered three

reasons. His first two reasons have to do with what economists refer to as

**positive time preference** . The first reason Böhm-Bawerk offers is that over
time, an individual's marginal utility declines because an individual expects
higher income in the future. Appealing to psychology, his second reason is
that the marginal utility of a product/good declines over time. Taken
together, positive time preference—according to Böhm-Bawerk—results in
individuals who want to borrow to pay a positive interest rate and for those
who are willing to lend to require compensation in the form of a positive
interest rate. This idea of positive time preference is consistent with the
theoretical framework of Fisher.

In addition to time preference, like Fisher, Böhm-Bawerk recognized the

importance of technology and argued that technology is the third reason for

positive interest rates. His explanation of technology, which may be a little

more difficult to understand, is what he refers to as the "roundabout" nature

- f production or what he simply refers to as "roundaboutness," which
involves a time-consuming production process.

To understand what Böhm-Bawerk meant by "roundaboutness," we can

use the concept of "goods of higher order," a term originated by Carl

Menger, another Austrian economist. [8] He begins with "goods of lowest

- rder," which are goods that can be directly consumed. Crops produced by a
farmer would be an example of goods of lower order. Then there are the
tools that are used in production, and those tools would be of higher order
than goods that can be directly consumed. So, a hoe and tractor would be
examples of such goods. Going up an order higher, we have capital goods,
which are used to produce tools. The manufacturing of steel that is needed to
produce a hoe or a tractor and the manufacturing of rubber for the tires of a
tractor would be an example of capital goods. The further those goods that

are of higher order are from the production of the goods of lowest order, the

more time is needed.

Now let's return to Böhm-Bawerk's theory. The production process

begins with the production of capital goods, and then once those capital

goods are produced, they are used to help produce goods of lower order

desired by the economy. As a result, for the same amount of input, a

roundabout production process will generate a greater amount of output. In

- ther words, productivity can be increased if some production is allocated to
create goods of higher order that can be used to more efficiently create goods

- f lower order.

Böhm-Bawerk illustrates roundaboutness with an example of a person

who is seeking to obtain water from a spring. The simplest way to obtain the

water is to go to the spring each time water is desired. A more efficient

production process, however, would be to either use a pail to carry water

from the spring to that person's home or use a pipe to draw water from the

spring to the person's home. The manufacturing of a pail or the creation of a

conduit system to get water from the spring to the person's home are

examples of roundaboutness. The creation of the pail and the pipe involves

the creation of capital goods, but such creation take times time. One could

think of other examples, such as the production of steel or wood products

that a farmer can use to create tools to make farming more efficient.

The implication of roundaboutness is that it not only increases capital

goods but also affects interest rates. If capital goods generate higher levels of

- output for a given level of inputs, there must be a reward for doing so. This
increase in output takes the form of a rate of return, which is referred to as
"net productivity," and it can be measured terms of a percentage per year. It
is a "net" measure, because it is net of the costs of producing capital goods.
Producers of capital goods will create them only if doing so is expected to
result in a positive net productivity (and therefore will lead to a positive
interest rate) and will do so even if the two positive-time preference theories
do not hold.

```
Efficiency Properties of Markets

```

The equilibrium achieved with the intermediation of the loan markets

contributes an important property from the point of view of the efficiency of

the economy in producing and allocating resources. Economists refer to this

property as **Pareto optimality** . Instinctively we think of economic efficiency

as implying the absence, or minimization, of waste. Pareto optimality makes

that notion precise and conceptually operational: An allocation is Pareto

- ptimal if it is not possible to reallocate the goods (inputs and outputs) in
such a way that some will be better off while nobody will lose.

Clearly, if an allocation is not Pareto optimal, some slack or waste is

present; conversely, if slack is present, the allocation cannot be Pareto

- ptimal. In our simplified economy, Pareto optimality is ensured by profit
maximization plus the fact that, at market equilibrium, both the marginal
productivity of capital and the marginal rate of time preference equals _R_ for
every firm and for every consumer. Thus, it is impossible to increase output
by reshuffling inputs among firms; the additional output by those who would
gain inputs is offset precisely by the output lost by those losing inputs. By
similar reasoning, we can infer that no welfare gain can come from
reshuffling the given output among consumers.

Although this result is logically important, it turns out we cannot make

too much of it with respect to existing free market economies. First, the

result presupposes a perfectly competitive market, which free competition

may fail to ensure because of restrictive practices. Second, it ignores

transaction costs, information costs, and the consequences of incomplete

information. Third, it presents an issue of externalities or effects—negative

- r positive—that production may have on people other than the buyer of the
product. Finally, society may value things other than efficiency, such as the
distribution of welfare. Therefore, some non-Pareto optimal solution may
trade efficiency for some other property. All these considerations are
incentives to make markets more perfect and allow valuing externalities
through the price mechanism.

```
Real and Nominal Interest Rates: Fisher’s Law

```

The interest rate we have used in our discussion so far is the real rate, which

would prevail in the absence of inflation. This rate measures the amount of

the commodity next period that can be exchanged for one unit of the

commodity now. It generally differs from the nominal rate, which measures

the amount of money to be repaid next period per unit borrowed now. The

two rates are connected by a simple relation known as **Fisher's law** . It rests

- n the principle that an exchange of money now for money later must imply
the same rate of exchange between the commodity now and the commodity
later, as implied by the real rate.

_r_

Suppose the real rate is 1 + . Then by delivering one unit of the

_r_

commodity now, we can obtain (1 + ) units next period. Alternatively, we

could sell the commodity now at the spot price, _p_ 1, and invest the proceeds

in a loan at the nominal rate (1 + _i_ ), obtaining _p_ 1(1 + _i_ ) units of money next

period.

How many units of the next-period commodity does that equation

represent? To find the answer, we must divide by the second-period price of

the commodity, _p_ 2. Thus, the second-period quantity is _p_ 1(1 + _i_ )/( _p_ 2). This

_r_

quantity must equal the real rate (1 + ):

where the denominator of equation (15.1) is from

    - =

and ( _p_ 2 _p_ 1)/ _p_ 1 _p_ - = the percentage rise in the price level over the period

- f the loan.

Equation (15.1) can be restated in the form

(1 + _i_ ) = (1 + _r_ )(1 + _p_ *).

Therefore, the nominal gross rate is the product of the gross real rate and 1

plus the rate of inflation. The equation, in turn, implies that

_i_ = _r_ + _p_ - + _rp_ *.

For the most common values of _r_ and _p_, the product of _r_ and _p_ is small

enough to be neglected, and the equation can be written as

_i_ ≈ _r_ + _p_ *,

- r

Equation (15.2) is the formula commonly used to compute the ex post

real rate of interest, which cannot be observed directly in the market. It is

equally common to measure the anticipated or ex ante real rate of interest by

replacing _p_ by anticipated inflation. The ex ante rate differs from the ex post

rate because of errors of expectation. It should be clear that the real rate so

computed is not necessarily the same as the rate that would clear markets in

the economy without inflation, because market imperfections (including

taxation and possibly inflation illusion) can alter the real rate. For instance,

in the early phase of unanticipated inflation, the real rate typically falls. In

- ther words, besides reflecting fundamental forces (such as saving and
productivity), the real rate may also be affected by other forces (such as
inflation), especially in the short run.

```
Estimating the Market’s Expected Inflation Rate

```

Economists often make forecasts of the future rate of inflation over some

period of time. Prior to 1997, these forecasts were often used by market

professionals to estimate what interest rate adjustment should be made to

compensate for inflation when considering the purchase of a bond or making

a loan. Since 1997, however, it is far more common for market professionals

to use the yield on certain U.S. government securities to obtain an estimate

- f the market's consensus of the expected rate of inflation.

The U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are used for this

purpose. These securities are a specific type of inflation-adjusted securities

- r inflation-linked bonds that are issued by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury. They are described in more detail in chapter 20. For our purpose
here, the details about the mechanics of TIPS are unimportant. Basically,
TIPS are issued via an auction process, in which their yield is determined.
The investor in a TIPS receives the yield, which is determined through the
bidding process plus an adjustment for the rate of inflation lagged by two
months. The rate of inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index
(CPI). The yield that the investor bids for is the real interest rate, which (as
explained earlier) is the difference between the nominal yield and the

expected rate of inflation. So, if an investors bids 0.50%, then the investor

receives 0.50% plus the rate of inflation measured by the CPI with a twomonth lag.

To estimate the expected inflation rate, an investor compares the yield on

a TIPS with that of the yield on a traditional Treasury security with the same

maturity. That yield is a nominal interest rate. Because we know from

Fisher's law that the nominal yield minus the expected rate of inflation is the

real yield, we can back out the expected rate of inflation. This is done by

subtracting the real yield for the TIPS of the same maturity from the nominal

yield of a Treasury security with a given maturity. On August 29, 2017, the

yield quote on a traditional 10-year Treasury note was 2.17%, and the yield

quote for a 10-year TIPS was 0.42%. Thus, the expected annual inflation

rate over the next 10 years would be 1.75% (i.e., 2.17% − 0.42%).

```
Natural Rate of Interest

```

The **natural rate of interest** (also called the "neutral rate of interest") is the

real short-term interest rate that would prevail if there were no transitory

financial disturbances. That is, it is interest rate that would prevail for stable

economic output and a constant inflation rate. The natural interest rate

provides a benchmark for the conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy

would be judged to be expansionary if the short-term real rate were below

the natural rate, and contractionary in the opposite case. The natural rate of

interest is used in policy discussions and decisions.

Closely related to the natural interest rate is the natural rate of

unemployment. The unemployment rate is also of paramount importance to

policymakers, such as the Fed. The "natural rate of employment"—

technically, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)—

is the rate of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in

aggregate demand. Even in good times, a healthy, dynamic economy will

have at least some unemployment as workers switch jobs (called "frictional

unemployment") and as new workers enter the labor force and other workers

leave it. The Fed makes monetary policy decisions to foster the lowest level

- f unemployment consistent with stable prices. In June 2017, the Federal

Open Market Committee (FOMC) estimated that the long-run normal rate of

unemployment was between 4.5% and 5.0%. [9]

There have been four major findings on the natural rate of interest

covering four advanced economies (the United States, Canada, the

Eurozone, and the United Kingdom). [10] The findings are consistent across the

four economies studied. The first major finding is evidence of time variation

in the natural rate of interest. The second finding is a downward trend in the

natural rate of interest, with the natural rates of all four economies being at

historically low levels. The third finding is a substantial co-movement in the

natural rate of interest across the four economies. Finally, the estimates of

the natural rates of interest are very imprecise.

```
Risk-Free Interest Rate and the Existence of a Safe Asset

```

The risk-free interest rate is the theoretical interest rate an investor would

require from a risk-free investment over a specified time. Here "risk free"

means that all the risks described in chapter 10 do not exist in an investment

that is classified as riskless.

For example, a three-month Treasury bill has often been referred to as a

"risk-free investment" and therefore as a safe security for investors who

want to avoid any risk, assuming that investors hold it for three months.

However, it would have price risk if it were held for either one month or six

months. If the investment was for a one-month holding period, the threemonth Treasury bill would have to be sold before maturity at an initial

unknown price, thus exposing the investor to price risk. With a six-month

holding period, at the end of three-months, the investor would have to invest

in a new three-month investment at an initially unknown yield. In either

case, the investor is faced with an unknown risk over a three-month holding

period. Thus, many investors would consider a three-month U.S. Treasury

bill to be risk-free rate for U.S. investors who plan to hold it over a threemonth holding period. However, two implicit assumptions are made when

classifying a three-month Treasury bill as a risk-free security. First, it is

assumed that the U.S. government will not default on its obligations (i.e., no

credit risk). Second, it is assumed that inflation is insignificant (i.e., no

inflation risk). Moreover, for an investor whose home currency is not the

U.S. dollar, an investment in a three-month Treasury bill would expose the

investor to foreign-exchange rate risk.

There is an ongoing controversy—the **safe asset controversy**  - that in

real-world financial markets there is a shortage or absence of a risk-free

asset offering a meaningful positive riskless rate. There are several

definitions of what a safe asset is. Gary Gorton defines a safe asset as "an

asset that is (almost always) valued at face value without expensive and

prolonged analysis." [11] Safe assets play several critical roles in a financial

market. First, safe assets are used by certain financial entities to satisfy

regulatory requirements. Second, they are used as a pricing benchmark.

Third, they are used as collateral in financial transactions. Finally, the

development of asset pricing theory and derivatives pricing relies on the

existence of a safe or riskless asset. However, as Peter Fisher, former

undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury, states in an article about the meaning of

the riskless rate: "The idea of risk-free sovereign bonds is best thought of as

an oxymoron or as an anomaly of recent history. It is not a useful, necessary

- r an enduring feature of the financial landscape." [12]

Several studies have focused on the challenges for monetary policy and

global financial stability when there is a shortage of a safe asset. [13] Other

studies have investigated how asset pricing (discussed in chapter 14) would

be impacted when either there is no meaningful riskless asset offering a

positive interest rate or if for some reason market participants (such as

investors and traders) elect not to invest in a riskless asset. One of the earlier

investigations of the role of a riskless asset in financial theory is by Fischer

Black, who confirmed that the CAPM holds even in the absence of a riskfree asset (referred to as "Black's zero-beta CAPM"). [14]

```
Negative Interest Rates

```

In recent years, some countries have realized nominal negative interest rates

for some periods. The economic reason for the realization of negative

nominal interest rates is as follows. When weak economies cause deflation

(a decline in price levels), investors tend to conserve spending and save,

instead of spending and investing. They plan to spend in the future when

prices are lower due to inflation. This leads to a further decrease in aggregate

demand, leading to further deflation. An expansionary monetary policy—

that is, lower interest rates—is often used to combat what economists refer

to as "stagnation." Monetary easing by the Fed (in the case of the United

States) is accomplished by the Fed buying outstanding debt securities to

reduce Treasury yields, which is the standard way of dealing with deflation.

According to this method, the Fed funds rate is the interest rate target. This

method is called **qualitative easing** . However, if deflationary pressure is

sufficiently weak, even reducing the Fed's interest rate to zero may not

provide sufficient stimulus to the economy. A negative interest rate may

therefore be necessary. When the Fed employs this method, it is referred to

as a **negative interest rate policy** .

With a negative interest rate, the Fed and, subsequently, individual

commercial banks charge negative rates to their lenders. That is, depositors

in banks, instead of receiving money on deposits, pay to keep their money in

the bank. This provides an incentive for depositors to spend the money

rather than pay interest for keeping it as deposits. For example, according to

a negative interest rate policy, if the negative interest rate were −0.2%, bank

depositors would have to pay 0.2% on their deposits instead of receiving a

positive interest rate.

When the financial crisis of 2008–2009 struck, the central bank of the

United Kingdom (the Bank of England) and other large central banks cut

their overnight rate for bank borrowing to almost zero. When their

economies still did not recover, they began to experiment with other tools.

One of these tools was quantitative easing, to be explained shortly. A

negative interest rate policy has also been used by several other countries.

The European Central Bank (ECB) introduced negative rates in 2014 on

behalf of its member countries, to prevent the Eurozone from falling into a

deflationary spiral. Non-Eurozone countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, and

Switzerland, have also used negative rates for different purposes.

After 2008, the Fed found that even very low or negative interest rates

were insufficient to stimulate the economy, so rather than decreasing interest

rates to manage monetary policy, the Fed began to increase its balance sheet

holdings by buying outstanding long-term bonds. This type of easing was

called "quantitative" easing (QE). According to QE, the focus is on the size

- f the Fed's balance sheet that results from the Fed purchasing U.S.
government and other securities, rather than Fed-influenced interest rates,
which is the focus of qualitative easing monetary policy. QE in the U.S.
began on November 25, 2008, when the Fed announced that it would
purchase up to \$600 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and
agency debt. The Fed initiated a second round of quantitative easing, QE2,
in the fourth quarter of 2010, and subsequently conducted several other
rounds of QE. The Bank of Japan and the ECB also eased in this way.

In addition, in 2007, the U.S. economy was further weakened by federal

government budgetary problems, which involved cutbacks. Specifically, no

stimulative fiscal policy was in place, further weakening the economy. By

September 2017, the economy had strengthened, and the Fed began

unwinding the QE plan implemented in 2008 by then-Fed chairman

Bernanke to stimulate the weak economy. During this QE period, the Fed

had more than quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to \$4.5 trillion. This

plan for unwinding was a sign of confidence in the economic recovery.

```
Historical Interest Rates in the United States

```

Thus far we have described two types of what is referred to as "interest

rates": nominal interest rates and real interest rates. Here we take a brief look

at historical nominal and real interest rates in the United States based on

yields on U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Treasury bills are short-term

instruments issued by the U.S. government with a maturity of no more than

- ne year. U.S. Treasury notes and bonds have a maturity in excess of one
year. Treasury notes have a maturity of up to 10 years, and bonds have a
maturity greater than 10 years. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

From 1870 until 1978, the yields on U.S. Treasury securities varied

between 2% and 7% most of the time. Therefore, the historical yields on

U.S. Treasury securities were quite simple during this 109-year period. But

from 1970 to 1979, the economy experienced stagnation, which is a

combination of slow economic growth and accelerating inflation. This

stagnation was induced by the 1973 oil crises and the 1979 energy crisis.

The resulting inflation was of significant concern to federal government

policymakers, including the Fed and then-president Jimmy Carter. This

concern was the basis for what was referred to as the "Volcker tightening."

Paul Volcker became the Fed chairman during August 1979 and remained

until August 1987. Volcker instituted a series of Fed tightenings of the Fed

funds rate beginning in 1979 to eliminate inflation. Under Volcker, the Fed

funds rate reached highs of 20% during 1979 and 1980. This series of

tightenings also caused two recessions in 1980 (six months) and 1981–1982

(16 months). In addition, during 1981, the 30-year Treasury bond yield

increased to more than 14%.

Although that was the bad news at the time, the good news resulting from

these tightenings and recessions was that they unleashed a period of

economic growth, reduction in the inflation rate, and a decline in bond

yields. They also induced a stock market rally, which continued into mid2018 (but also included two major equity bear markets in 2000–2002 and

2007–2009, discussed below). Ten-year Treasury yields declined to

approximately 1.50% in 2015 and remained slightly over 2% in 2017.

Returning to the Fed tightening period during 1979–1981, prior to this

period, during 1979, inflation was 13.31%, and long-term corporate bonds

returned −4.18%. After the Fed tightening began, the Fed funds rate

exceeded 19%, the one-year Treasury bill yield exceeded 10%, the 10-year

Treasury note yield exceeded 15%, and the inflation rate was more than 11%

(in early 1980). [15]

The economy recovered quickly from the two recessions. Inflation, which

had annual rates of 13.3% and 12.4% in 1979 and 1980, respectively (it

peaked at 14.8% in March 1980), declined to 8.9% in 1981 and 3.9% in

1982. After real GDP growth rates of −0.04%, 1.29%, and −1.40% in 1980,

1981, and 1982, respectively, real GDP growth grew by 7.83% (1983),

5.63% (1984), and 4.28% in 1983 (1985). The rest of the 1980s and the

beginning of the first half of the 1990s exhibited moderate growth—with the

exception of 1991, which experienced a short (8-month), mild (−0.17% real

GDP growth) recession due to a real-estate based recession.

Then from 1995 to 1999, one of the strongest stock market periods in

U.S. history occurred. This was a large-cap growth, technology sector-led

rally and ended in what was called the tech "bubble." The years 2003–2006

constituted a period of economic and financial moderation—in fact, it was

called the "Great Moderation" due to its low macroeconomic volatility.

In 2007–2008, another speculative period—this time due mainly to

subprime mortgages—called the Great Recession (as opposed to the Great

Depression in 1929) followed. This was the most severe recession since the

Great Depression. The Great Recession has had a continuing effect on the

bond market. In 2008, yields on U.S. Treasury bills fell from slightly over

3.0% at the beginning of the year to almost zero by the end of the year. In

the wake of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, investors' behavior could be

described as an extreme flight to safety—investors were willing to accept

little (if anything) risk in return for the assurance that they would get their

principal back. In other words, the return of capital took precedence over the

return on capital. [16] From 2009 to 2017, 10-year Treasury note yields

remained near historical lows at 2.3%. From 2009 to 2015, the yield on 90day Treasury bills did not exceed 0.12%.

These movements have led to a current conundrum in the bond market as

- f year-end 2017. Many bond market observers ask when bond yields will
return to their "normal" higher yields of 5% and more, using the period of
1970–2000 as the basis for what is normal in the bond market. In contrast,
many bond market observers look at the period after 1970–2000 and
conclude that 10-year Treasury bond yields are currently normal at slightly
more than 2%, where they have been for more than a decade. The
proponents of the post-2000 low yield as being normal argue that the 1970–
2000 period was an anomalous period and therefore does not represent what
market participants should expect for future interest rates.

Key Points

```

- Interest is the price paid for the temporary use of resources, and the
amount of a loan is its principal.

   - Irving Fisher's theory of interest analyzes the equilibrium level of the
interest rate as the result of the interaction of savers' willingness to save
and borrowers' demand for investment funds.

   - In Fisher's terms, the interest rate reflects the interaction of savers'
marginal rate of time preference and borrowers' marginal productivity

- f capital.
- The loanable funds theory is an extension of Fisher's theory and
proposes that the equilibrium rate of interest reflects the demand and
supply of funds, which depend on savers' willingness to save,
borrowers' expectations regarding the profitability of investing, and the
government's action regarding money supply.

- The liquidity preference theory is Keynes's view that the rate of
interest is set in the market for money balances.

- In the liquidity preference theory, the demand for money reflects the
liquidity of money by comparison with long-term financial instruments;
demand depends on the interest rate, income, and the price level.

- In the liquidity preference theory, changes in the money supply can
affect the level of interest rates through the liquidity effect, the income
effect, and the price expectations effect; their relative magnitudes
depend on the level of economic activity at the time of the change in the
money supply.

- Eugen Böhm von Bawerk set forth his theory of interest rates and
why interest rates must be positive: positive time preference, declining
marginal utility of a product/service over time, and technology
(roundaboutness).

- Fisher's law states that the observable nominal rate of interest is

composed of two unobservable variables: the real rate of interest and

the premium for expected inflation.

- The real rate of interest is the interest rate that would prevail in the
absence of inflation.

- It can be shown that the nominal rate of interest is approximately
equal to the real rate of interest plus anticipated inflation, a relationship
referred to as "Fisher's law."

- The yield offered on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) is
the market's real rate.

- The expected annual rate of inflation can be estimated from the yield
- n TIPS and the yield on traditional Treasury securities of the same
maturity.

   - The natural rate of interest (or neutral rate of interest) is the real
short-term interest rate that would prevail if there were no transitory
financial disturbances.

   - Safe assets play four critical roles in a financial market: (1) they are
used by certain financial entities to satisfy regulatory requirements; (2)
they are used as a pricing benchmark; (3) they are used as collateral in
financial transactions; and (4) the development of asset pricing theory
and derivatives pricing relies on the existence of a safe or riskless asset.

   - Negative interest rates can exist in an economy, and central bank
policies can produce that outcome.

17. Actually, Böhm-Bawerk's writings on the theory of interest rates appear in two books. His 1884
book, _Geschichte und Kritik der Kapitalzins-Theorieen_, translated by William Smart as _Capital and_
_Interest_ (North Charleston, SC: Createspace, 1989) described the various practical and theoretical

- pinions about interest rates. The book laid the foundation for his book (translated by William Smart
in 1989), _The Positive Theory of Capital_ (North Charleston, SC: Createspace, 1989). The 1989
translated book is available at https://mises.org/system/tdf

Theory and Fisher's Rate of Interest through Modern Prisms," _Journal of the History of Economic_
_Thought_ 16, no. 2 (1994): 202–228.

4. John Maynard Keynes, _The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money_ (New York:
Harcourt, Brace & World, 1936).

7. Admittedly, we are not doing justice to the important contribution of his work not only to capital
theory but also to how his theory disputes the view of social theory as set forth by Karl Marx.
