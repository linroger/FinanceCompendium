In chapter 15, we explained interest rate determination in a simple economy.

However, no economy has just one interest rate; instead, there is a structure of interest rates. The interest rate that a borrower must pay depends on a myriad of factors, which we describe in this chapter. We begin with a discussion of the structure of interest rates, explaining the factors that affect the yield spread or risk premium for non-U.S. Treasury securities (i.e., why debt obligations not issued by the U.S. Treasury offer a higher potential yield than U.S. Treasury securities offer). We then focus on one particular relationship: the relationship between the yield offered on a debt obligation and its maturity. This relationship is referred to as the "term structure of interest rates."

```
The Structure of Interest Rates

```

The numerous debt obligations issued by public and private entities throughout the world offer different interest rates. When an entity agrees to pay an interest rate on a debt obligation that it has issued, the interest rate is not randomly determined. Instead, certain factors affect the interest rates that determine what interest rate an entity will have to pay if it wants to borrow money. We refer to these factors that determine the interest rate that borrowers must pay as the "structure of interest rates." The starting point in determining the interest rate that a borrower must pay is the base interest rate.

```
The Base Interest Rate

```

The securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, popularly referred as to **Treasury**

**securities**, or simply **Treasuries**, are backed by the full faith and credit of

the U.S. government. Consequently, market participants throughout the

world view them as having no credit risk. As a result, historically the interest

rates on Treasury securities served as the benchmark interest rates

throughout the U.S. economy, as well as in international capital markets.

Other important benchmarks have developed in the international capital

markets, and we will discuss one of these.

Treasury securities are used to develop benchmark interest rates. The two

categories of U.S. Treasury securities are discount securities and coupon

securities. The fundamental difference between the two types results from

the form of the stream of payments that the holder receives, which in turn

reflects the prices at which the securities are issued. Coupon securities pay

interest every six months, plus principal at maturity. Discount securities pay

only a contractually fixed amount at maturity. Treasury securities are
typically issued on an auction basis according to regular cycles for securities of specific maturities. The current Treasury practice is to issue all securities
with maturities of one year or less as discount securities, called **Treasury**
**bills** . All securities with maturities of two years or longer are issued as **Treasury coupon securities**

The most recently auctioned Treasury issues for each maturity are

referred to as **on-the-run issues** or **current coupon issues** . Issues auctioned

prior to the current coupon issues are typically referred to as **off-the-run**

**issues**. They are not as liquid as on-the-run issues and therefore offer a higher

yield than the corresponding on-the-run Treasury issue. Note that every day,

the U.S. Department of the Treasury estimates the yield for Treasury

securities based on the yield for on-the-run and off-the-run issues.

The minimum interest rate or **base interest rate** that investors demand

for investing in a non-Treasury security is the yield offered on a comparable

maturity for an on-the-run Treasury security. So, for example, if an investor

wanted to purchase a 10-year bond on a particular day at the time that the 10-year on-the-run Treasury is 4.49%, then the minimum yield the investor would want is 4.49%. The base interest rate is also referred to as the **benchmark interest rate**. [1]

```
The Risk Premium

```

Market participants talk of interest rates on non-Treasury securities as

"trading at a spread" to a particular on-the-run Treasury security (or at a

spread to any particular benchmark interest rate selected). For example, if

the yield on a 10-year non-Treasury security is 5.89% when the on-the-run

10-year Treasury yield is 4.49%, then the spread would be 140 basis points.

This spread reflects the additional risks the investor faces by acquiring this security that is not issued by the U.S. government, and therefore the spread can be called a **risk premium**. Thus, we can express the interest rate offered on a non-Treasury security as

Base interest rate + Spread,

or equivalently,

Base interest rate + Risk premium.

We have already discussed the factors that affect the base interest rate in

chapter 15. One of the factors is the expected rate of inflation. That is, the

base interest rate can be expressed as

Base interest rate = Real rate of interest + Expected rate of inflation.

How can the real rate of inflation required by market participants be

estimated? The U.S. Department of the Treasury issues securities indexed to

the CPI. These securities are called **Treasury Inflation Protected Securities**

(TIPS), and we discuss them in chapter 20.

There are factors that affect the interest rate by which a security offers

above an otherwise comparable benchmark security. This additional interest

rate is referred to as the **yield spread** or simply **spread** . The factors that

drive the yield spread include

1. the type of issuer,
2. the issuer's perceived creditworthiness,
3. the term or maturity of the instrument,
4. provisions that grant either the issuer or the investor the option to do

something,

5. the taxability of the interest received by investors, and
6. the expected liquidity of the issue.

Typically, the benchmark interest rate used is a U.S. Treasury security.

However, it is important to emphasize that yield spreads must be interpreted

relative to the benchmark interest rate used, particularly in relation to the

second and last factors, which affect the spread when the benchmark interest

rate is other than the yield on U.S. Treasury securities.

**`Types of issuers`** A key feature of a debt obligation is the nature of the
issuer. The bond market is classified by the type of issuer, and groups of
securities of the various kinds of issuers are referred to as **market sectors** .

The spread between the interest rates offered in two sectors of the bond

market on obligations with the same maturity is referred to as an

**intermarket sector spread** .

Excluding the Treasury market sector, the other market sectors include a

wide range of issuers, each with different abilities to satisfy their contractual

obligations. For example, in the corporate market sector, issuers are
classified as follows: (1) utilities, (2) industrials, (3) finance, and (4) banks.
The spread between two issues in a market sector is called an **intramarket**
**sector spread** .

**`Perceived creditworthiness of issuer`** As explained in chapter 10,
credit risk encompasses two forms of risk: default risk and credit spread risk.
The risk that the issuer of a bond may be unable to make timely principal or
interest payments is called "default risk" and is gauged by the issuer's credit
rating, as assigned by credit rating agencies (the three major ones being
Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Corporation, and Fitch
Ratings).

In all systems, the term **high grade** means low credit risk, or conversely,

a high probability of future payments. The highest-grade bonds are denoted

by Moody's by the symbol Aaa, and by S&P and Fitch by the symbol AAA.

The next highest grade is denoted by the symbol Aa (Moody's) or AA (S&P

and Fitch). For the third grade, all rating systems use A. The next three

grades are Baa or BBB, Ba or BB, and B, respectively. There are also C

grades. Moody's uses 1, 2, or 3 to provide a narrower credit quality

breakdown within each class, and S&P and Fitch use plus and minus signs

for the same purpose.

Bonds rated triple A (AAA or Aaa) are said to be **prime**, double A (AA or Aa) are of **high quality**, single-A issues are called **upper medium grade**,
and triple-B issues are **medium grade** _._ Lower-rated bonds are said to have
speculative elements or to be **distinctly speculative** .

Bond issues assigned a rating in the top four categories are referred to as

**investment-grade bonds** . Issues that carry a rating below the top four

categories are referred to as **noninvestment-grade bonds**, or more popularly

as **high-yield bonds** or **junk bonds** . Thus the bond market can be divided

into two sectors, the investment-grade and noninvestment-grade markets.

Another form of credit risk that we did not describe in chapter 10

(because we did not discuss credit ratings) is the risk that the issuer's credit

rating will be lowered. This risk is referred to as **downgrade risk** .

The spread between Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities that

are identical in all respects except for credit quality is referred to as a **credit**

**spread** . For example, suppose that the yield for corporate bonds with 10

years to maturity on a particular day is 5.39% for AAA-rated bonds and

5.66% for AA-rated bonds. Suppose also that the 10-year on-the-run

Treasury rate is 4.49%. Hence, the yield spread for 10-year AAA-rated

corporate bonds is 90 basis points (5.39% − 4.49%), and for AA-rated

corporate bonds the yield spread is 117 basis points (5.66% − 4.49%). In this

illustration, we see that the lower the credit quality is, the larger the yield

spread will be. This is the typical relationship observed in real-world debt

markets.

**`Term to maturity`** As explained in chapter 11, the price of a financial asset
fluctuates over its life as yields in the market change. As we demonstrated,
the volatility of a bond's price depends on its maturity. More specifically,
holding all other factors constant, the longer the maturity of a bond is, the
greater will be its price volatility resulting from a change in market yields.
The spread between any two maturity sectors of the market is called a
**maturity spread**, or **yield curve spread** . (The graphical relationship
between the yield and maturity for a sector of the market is called the "yield
curve" and is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.) Although this
spread can be calculated for any sector of the market, it is most commonly
calculated for the Treasury sector.

In the corporate bond market, a maturity spread can be similarly calculated, but the issues must have the same credit quality. For example,

suppose that on a given day the following yields are observed for AA-rated

corporate bonds:

2-year AA corporate bonds: 4.67%

5-year AA corporate bonds: 5.07%

10-year AA corporate bonds: 5.66%

The maturity spreads are then:

2-year/5-year maturity spread: 5.07% − 4.67% = 0.40% = 40 bps

2-year/10-year maturity spread: 5.66% − 4.67% = 0.99% = 99 bps

5-year/10-year maturity spread: 5.66% − 5.07% = 0.59% = 59 bps

The relationship between the yields on comparable securities but

different maturities is called the **term structure of interest rates** . The term

to-maturity topic is of such importance that we devote the last section of this

chapter to it.

**`Inclusion of options`** It is not uncommon for a bond issue to include a
provision that gives either the bondholder or the issuer an option to take
some action against the other party. An option that is included in a bond
issue is referred to as an **embedded option** .

The most common type of option in a bond issue is a **call provision** . This

provision grants the issuer the right to retire the debt, fully or partially,

before the scheduled maturity date. The inclusion of a call feature benefits

issuers by allowing them to replace an old bond issue with a lower-interestcost issue should interest rates in the market decline. Effectively, a call

provision allows the issuer to alter the maturity of a bond. A call provision is

detrimental to the bondholder, because the bondholder will be uncertain

about maturity and might have to reinvest the proceeds received at a lower

interest rate if the bond is called and the bondholder wants to keep his or her

funds in issues with a similar risk of default.

An issue may also include a provision that allows the bondholder to alter

the maturity of a bond. An issue with a **put provision** grants the bondholder

the right to sell the issue back to the issuer at par value on designated dates.

Here the advantage to the investor is that, if interest rates rise after the issue

date and result in a price that is less than the par value, the investor can force

the issuer to redeem the bond at par value.

A **convertible bond** is an issue giving the bondholder the right to

exchange the bond for a specified number of shares of common stock. This

feature allows the bondholder to take advantage of favorable movements in

the price of the issuer's common stock.

The presence of these embedded options affects the spread of an issue

relative to a Treasury security and the spread relative to otherwise

comparable issues that do not have an embedded option. In general, market

participants require a larger spread over a comparable Treasury security for

an issue with an embedded option that is favorable to the issuer (e.g., a call

option) than for an issue without such an option. In contrast, market
participants require a smaller spread over a comparable Treasury security for
an issue with an embedded option that is favorable to the investor (e.g., a put

option or a conversion option). In fact, for a bond with an option that is
favorable to an investor, the interest rate on an issue may be less than that on
a comparable Treasury security!

A major part of the bond market is the mortgage market. A wide range of

mortgage-backed securities is discussed in chapters 30 and 31. But as

explained in chapter 10, these securities expose an investor to a form of call

risk known as "prepayment risk." Consequently, a yield spread between a

mortgage-backed security and a comparable on-the-run Treasury security

reflects this call risk. To see how, let's consider a basic mortgage-backed

security called a "Ginnie Mae pass-through security." This security is backed

by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Consequently, the yield

spread between a Ginnie Mae pass-through security and a comparable

Treasury security is not to the result of credit risk. Instead, it is primarily the

result of call risk.

**`Taxability of interest`** Unless exempted under the federal income tax
code, interest income is taxable at the federal level. In addition to federal
income taxes, state and local taxes may apply to interest income.

The U.S. federal tax code specifically exempts the interest income from

qualified municipal bond issues from taxation at the federal level.

**Municipal bonds** are securities issued by state and local governments and

by their creations, such as "authorities" and special districts.

The large majority of outstanding municipal bonds are tax-exempt

securities. Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal bonds, the yield

- n municipal bonds is less than that on Treasuries with the same maturity.
The difference in yield between tax-exempt securities and Treasury
securities is typically measured not in basis points but in percentage terms.
More specifically, it is measured as the percentage of the yield on a taxexempt security relative to the yield of a comparable Treasury security.

The yield on a taxable bond issue after federal income taxes are paid is:

After-tax yield = Pre-tax yield × (1 − Marginal tax rate).

For example, suppose a taxable bond issue offers a yield of 3% and is

acquired by an investor facing a marginal tax rate of 35%. The after-tax yield would then be:

After-tax yield = 0.03 × (1 − 0.35) = 0.0195 = 1.95%.

Alternatively, we can determine the yield that must be offered on a taxable bond issue to give the same after-tax yield as a tax-exempt issue. This yield is called the **equivalent-taxable yield** and is determined as follows:

For example, consider an investor facing a 35% marginal tax rate who purchases a tax-exempt issue with a yield of 1.95%. The equivalent-taxable yield is:

Note that the lower the marginal tax rate is, the lower the equivalent-taxable yield will be. Thus, in our previous example, if the marginal tax rate were 25% rather than 35%, the equivalent-taxable yield would be 2.6% rather than 4%, as shown here:

In the United States, state and local governments may tax interest income on bond issues that are exempt from federal income taxes. Some municipalities exempt interest income paid on all municipal issues from taxation; others do not. Some states exempt interest income from bonds issued by municipalities in the state but tax the interest income from bonds issued by municipalities outside the state. The implication is that two municipal securities of the same quality rating and the same maturity may trade at some spread because of different tax policies and hence the relative demand for bonds of municipalities in different states. For example, in a high-income-tax state, such as the State of New York, the demand for bonds of municipalities drives down their yield relative to the yield of bonds issued by municipalities in low-income-tax states, such as the State of Florida.

In the United States, municipalities are not permitted to tax the interest income from securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. Thus, part of the spread between Treasury securities and taxable non-Treasury securities of the same maturity reflects the value of the exemption from state and local taxes.

**`Expected liquidity of an issue`** Bonds trade with different degrees of liquidity. The greater the expected liquidity with which an issue trades, the lower will be the yield that investors require.

As noted earlier, Treasury securities are the most liquid securities in the world. The lower yield offered on Treasury securities relative to the yield on non-Treasury securities reflects, to a significant extent, the difference in liquidity. Even in the Treasury market, however, some differences in liquidity occur, because on-the-run issues have greater liquidity than do off-the-run issues. An important factor that affects the liquidity of an issue is the size of the issue. One of the reasons U.S. Treasury securities are highly liquid is the large size of each individual issue.

### An Alternative Benchmark Interest Rate: The Swap Rate

Let us return to the interpretation of the yield spread on a non-U.S. Treasury

security that is used as the benchmark interest rate. Because the U.S.

Treasury securities are viewed by market participants as having minimal

credit risk, the yield spread between a non-U.S. Treasury security and that on

a U.S. Treasury security reflects credit risk, as well as liquidity risk and the

risk associated with any embedded options. Several alternative benchmarks

have been suggested. The attributes of a benchmark interest rate are that (1)

the market for the financial instrument should be viewed as having minimal

credit risk, and (2) it should be highly liquid.

Of the several alternative benchmarks suggested, the one that has been

used most frequently is the interest rate swap rate. We describe an interest

rate swap and the swap rate in more detail in chapter 37. Here we briefly

explain a generic interest rate swap, which is a derivative instrument.

The parties to an interest rate swap exchange interest rate payments on specified dates: One party pays a fixed rate and the other party a floating rate over the life of the swap. In a typical swap, the floating rate is based on a reference rate, and the reference rate is typically LIBOR. LIBOR is the interest rate at which prime banks in London pay other prime banks on U.S. dollar certificates of deposits.

The fixed interest rate that is paid by the fixed-rate counterparty is called the **swap rate** . Dealers in the swap market quote swap rates for different maturities. For example, the fixed interest rate may be the 10-year Treasury rate. So a 10-year treasury rate would be "swapped for" the LIBOR. The relationship between the swap rate and the maturity of a swap is called the **swap rate yield curve**, or more commonly, the **swap curve** . Because the reference rate is typically LIBOR, the swap curve is also called the **LIBOR** **curve** .

There is a swap curve for most countries. For euro interest rate swaps, the reference rate is the euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), which is the rate at which bank deposits in EU countries that have adopted the euro currency are offered by one prime bank to another prime bank.

The swap curve is used as a benchmark in many countries outside the United States. Unlike a country's government bond yield curve, however, the swap curve is not a default-free yield curve. Instead, it reflects the credit risk of the counterparty to an interest rate swap. Because the counterparty to an interest rate swap is typically a bank-related entity, the swap curve reflects the average credit risk of representative banks that provide interest rate swaps. More specifically, a swap curve is viewed as the **interbank yield** **curve** . It is also referred to as the **AA-rated yield curve**, because the banks that borrow money from one another at LIBOR have credit ratings of Aa/AA or above. In addition, the swap curve reflects liquidity risk. However, the liquidity of the interest rate swap market has increased to the point where it is now a more liquid market than the market for some government bonds.

One would expect that if a country has a government bond market, the

yields in that market will be the best benchmark. That is not necessarily the

case. Using a swap curve has several advantages over using a country's

government securities yield curve. [2] First, it may be advantageous for

technical reasons: In a government bond market, some of the interest rates

may not be representative of the true interest rate but instead be biased by

some technical or regulatory factor unique to that market. For example,

market participants may need to cover a short position in a particular

government bond, and the actions to cover a short position would push up

the demand for that particular government bond and drive down its yield. In

the swap market, nothing has to be delivered, so technical market factors

have less of an impact. Also, there may be government bonds selling above

or below their par value. As explained earlier, government tax authorities
might tax such bonds differently if they are purchased and held to maturity.
As a result, the yields at which these bonds trade in the marketplace will
reflect any tax advantage or disadvantage.

Although it may be difficult to appreciate these factors at this point in our

study of financial markets, the key is that the observed interest rate on

government securities may not reflect the true interest rate because of these

factors. This is not the case for swap rates. This market is not regulated, and

hence swap rates represent true interest rates. However, swap rates do reflect

credit risk and liquidity risk.

Second, to create a representative government bond yield curve, a large

number of maturities must be available. However, in most government bond

markets, securities with only a few maturities are issued. For example, as

will be seen when we discuss U.S. Treasury securities in chapter 20, the U.S.

government issues only four securities with a maturity of two years or more

(2, 5, 10, and 30 years). Although plenty of off-the-run issues are available

from which to construct a government bond yield curve, the yields on such

issues may not be true interest rates for the reasons just noted. In contrast, in

the swap market, a wide range of maturities is quoted. In fact, in the United

States, the issuance of 30-year bonds was suspended for a time, and as a

result, 30-year Treasury rates were unavailable. Yet swap dealers quoted 30

year swap rates.

Finally, the ability to compare government yields across countries is

difficult because of differences in the credit risk for every country. In

contrast, as explained earlier, the swap curve is an interbank yield curve,

which facilitates cross-country comparisons of benchmark interest rates.

```
The Term Structure of Interest Rates

```

Now we will look at the relationship between the yield on a bond and its

maturity. Because the maturity of a bond is referred to as its **term to**

**maturity** or simply its **term**, the relationship between yield and maturity is

referred to as the **term structure of interest rates** . Here we explain the

various theories about the determinations of the term structure of interest

rates.

The graphic that depicts the relationship between the yield on bonds of

the same credit quality but different maturities is known as the **yield curve** .

Market participants tend to construct yield curves from observations of

prices and yields in the Treasury market. Two reasons account for this

tendency. First, Treasury securities are free of default risk, and differences in

creditworthiness do not affect yield estimates. Second, as the largest and

most active bond market, the Treasury market offers the fewest problems of

illiquidity or infrequent trading.

Figure 16.1 shows the general shape of three hypothetical Treasury yield

curves observed from time to time in the United States. Daily yield curve

information is available from a variety of sources on a real-time basis.

Historical information about daily yield curves from 1990 on can be

- btained from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website. [3]

```
Figure 16.1

```

Three hypothetical yield curves.

As we explained in chapter 15, from a practical viewpoint, the Treasury

yield curve functions mainly as a benchmark for pricing bonds and setting

yields in many other sectors of the debt market—bank loans, mortgages,

corporate debt, and international bonds. More recently, market participants

have come to realize that the traditionally constructed Treasury yield curve is

an unsatisfactory measure of the relationship between required yield and

maturity. The key reason is that securities with the same maturity may

actually provide different yields. As we will explain, this phenomenon

reflects the role and impact of differences in the bonds' coupon rates. Hence,

it is necessary to develop more accurate and reliable estimates of the

Treasury yield curve. In what follows, we show the problems posed by

traditional approaches to the Treasury yield curve and offer an innovative

and increasingly popular approach to building a yield curve. The approach

consists of identifying yields that apply to zero-coupon bonds and therefore

eliminates the problem of nonuniqueness in the yield-maturity relationship.

```
Spot Rates

```

As explained in chapter 11, the price of any financial asset is the present

value of its cash flow. However, in our illustrations and discussion to this

point in the book, we have assumed that one interest rate should be used to

discount all cash flows from a financial asset. In chapter 15, we indicated

that the appropriate interest rate is the yield on a Treasury security with the

same maturity as the financial asset, plus an appropriate yield premium or

spread.

As just noted, however, there is a problem with using the Treasury yield

curve to determine the appropriate yield at which to discount the cash flow

- f a bond. To illustrate this problem, we'll use the following two
hypothetical five-year Treasury bonds, A and B. The difference between
these two Treasury bonds is the coupon rate, which is 12% for A and 3% for
B. The cash flow for these two bonds per \$100 of par value for the 10 sixmonth periods to maturity would be:

Period Cash Flow for A ($) Cash Flow for B ($)

1–9 6.00 1.50

10 106.00 101.50

Because of the different cash flow patterns, it is not appropriate to use the

same interest rate to discount all cash flows. Instead, each cash flow should

be discounted at a unique interest rate that is appropriate for the time period

in which the cash flow will be received. But what should the interest rate be

for each period?

The correct way to think about bonds A and B is not as bonds but as

packages of cash flows. More specifically, they are packages of zero-coupon

instruments. A **zero-coupon instrument** is one that is purchased at an

amount below its maturity value and pays no interest periodically. Instead,

the interest is earned at the maturity date, when the investor receives the

maturity or principal value. Thus, the interest earned is the difference

between the maturity value and the price paid. For example, bond A can be

viewed as 10 zero-coupon instruments: one with a maturity value of \$6

maturing six months from now, a second with a maturity value of \$6

maturing one year from now, a third with a maturity value of \$6 maturing

1.5 years from now, and so on. The final zero-coupon instrument matures 10

six-month periods from now and has a maturity value of \$106.

Likewise, bond B can be viewed as 10 zero-coupon instruments: one with

a maturity value of \$1.50 maturing six months from now, one with a

maturity value of \$1.50 maturing one year from now, one with a maturity

value of \$1.50 maturing 1.5 years from now, and so on. The final zerocoupon instrument matures 10 six-month periods from now and has a

maturity value of \$101.50. Obviously, in the case of each coupon bond, the

value or price of the bond is equal to the total value of its component zerocoupon instruments.

In general, any bond can be viewed as a package of zero-coupon

instruments. That is, each zero-coupon instrument in the package has a

maturity equal to its coupon payment date or, in the case of the principal, the

maturity date. The value of the bond should equal the value of all the

component zero-coupon instruments. If this does not hold, it is possible for a

market participant to generate riskless profits. Because no one can pass up

riskless and certain profits, the market must drive these two prices to

equality, and our discussion here assumes that equality.

To determine the value of each zero-coupon instrument, it is necessary to

know the yield on a zero-coupon Treasury with that same maturity. This

yield is called the **spot rate**, and the graphical depiction of the relationship

between the spot rate and its maturity is called the **spot rate curve** . As

demonstrated next, this curve is derived from theoretical considerations of

the yields of the actually traded Treasury securities. Such a curve is called a

**theoretical spot rate curve** .

**`Constructing the theoretical spot rate curve`** Let's see how the
theoretical spot rate curve is constructed from the yield curve that is based

- n the observed yields of Treasury bills and Treasury coupon securities.

The process of creating a theoretical spot rate curve in this way is

referred to as **bootstrapping** . [4] To explain this process, we'll use the data for

Throughout the analysis and illustrations to come, it is important to

remember that the basic principle underlying bootstrapping is that the value

- f the Treasury coupon security should be equal to the value of the package
- f zero-coupon Treasury securities that duplicates the coupon bond's cash
flow.

Let's start by considering the six-month Treasury bill in table 16.1. As we

explained earlier in this chapter, a Treasury bill is a zero-coupon instrument.

Therefore, its annualized yield of 8% is equal to the spot rate. Similarly, for

the one-year Treasury, the cited yield of 8.3% is the one-year spot rate. [5]

Given these two spot rates, we can compute the spot rate for a theoretical

1.5-year zero-coupon Treasury. The price of a theoretical 1.5-year zerocoupon Treasury should equal the present value of the three cash flows from

an actual 1.5-year coupon Treasury, where the yield used for discounting is

the spot rate corresponding to the cash flow. Using \$100 as par, the cash

flow for the 1.5-year Treasury with the 8.5% coupon rate is computed as

follows:

0.5 years: 0.085 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.25.
1.0 years: 0.085 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.25.
1.5 years: 0.085 × $100 × 0.5 + 100 = $104.25.

The present value of the cash flow is then:

where

_z_

1 = one-half the annualized six-month theoretical spot rate,

_z_ 2 = one-half the one-year theoretical spot rate,

_z_

3 = one-half the 1.5-year theoretical spot rate.

Because the six-month spot rate and the one-year spot rate are 8.0% and

8.3%, respectively, we know these facts:

_z_ = 0.04 and _z_ = 0.0415.

1 2

We can compute the present value of the 1.5-year coupon Treasury

security as follows:

Because the price of the 1.5-year coupon Treasury security (from table

16.1) is \$99.45, the following relationship between the market price and the

present value of the cash flow must hold:

We can solve for the theoretical 1.5-year spot rate to obtain a value of _z_ 3 of

0.04465.

Doubling this yield, we obtain the bond-equivalent yield of 0.0893 or

8.93%, which is the theoretical 1.5-year spot rate. That rate is the rate that

the market would apply to a 1.5-year zero-coupon Treasury security if, in

fact, such a security existed.

Given the theoretical 1.5-year spot rate, we can obtain the theoretical

two-year spot rate. The cash flow for the two-year coupon Treasury in table

16.1 is

0.5 years: 0.090 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.50.
1.0 year: 0.090 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.50.
1.5 years: 0.090 × $100 × 0.5 = $4.50.
2.0 years: 0.090 × $100 × 0.5 + 100 = $104.50.

The present value of the cash flow is then:

where _z_ 4 is half of the two-year theoretical spot rate. Because the six-month

spot rate, the one-year spot rate, and the 1.5-year spot rate are 8.0%, 8.3%,

and 8.93%, respectively, then

_z_ 1 = 0.04, _z_ 2 = 0.0415, and _z_ 3 = 0.04465.

Therefore, the present value of the two-year Treasury security is

Because the price of the two-year coupon Treasury security is \$99.64, the

following relationship must hold:

Solving for the theoretical two-year spot rate, we would find that _z_ 4 is

0.046235. Doubling this yield, we obtain the theoretical two-year spot rate

bond-equivalent yield of 9.247%.

One can follow this approach iteratively to derive the theoretical 2.5-year

spot rate from the calculated values of _z_ 1, _z_ 2, _z_ 3, and _z_ 4 (the six-month, oneyear, 1.5-year, and two-year rates, respectively), and the price and coupon of

the bond with a maturity of 2.5 years. Furthermore, one could derive the

theoretical spot rates for the remaining 15 half-yearly rates. The spot rates

thus obtained are shown in table 16.2. They represent the term structure of

interest rates for maturities up to 10 years, at the particular time to which the

bond price quotations refer.

Column 2 of table 16.2 reproduces the calculated yield to maturity for the

coupon issue listed in table 16.1. A comparison of this column with the last

column giving the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon bond is instructive: It

confirms that bonds of the same maturity can have different yields to

maturity. That is, the yield of bonds of the same credit quality does not

depend on their maturity alone. Although the two columns do not change

much at the beginning, they diverge more after the third year, and by the

 ninth year, the zero-coupon yield is nearly 100 basis points higher than that

of the same maturity with a coupon of 13% and selling at a premium.

**`Using spot rates to value a bond`** Given the spot rates, the theoretical
value of a bond can be calculated by discounting a cash flow for a given
period by the corresponding spot rate for that period. This is illustrated in
table 16.3.

The bond in our illustration is a 10-year, 10% coupon Treasury bond. The

second column of table 16.3 shows the cash flow per \$100 of par value for a

10% coupon bond. The third column shows the theoretical spot rates. The

fourth column is simply one-half of the annual spot rate of the previous

column. The last column shows the present value of the cash flow in the

second column when discounted at the semiannual spot rate. The value of

this bond is the total present value, \$85.35477.

```
Forward Rates

```

Thus far we have seen that we can extrapolate the theoretical spot rates from

the Treasury yield curve. In addition, we can extrapolate what some market

participants refer to as the "market's consensus regarding future interest

rates." To see the importance of knowing the market's consensus regarding

future interest rates, let's consider the following two investment alternatives

for an investor who has a one-year investment horizon:

_Alternative 1:_ Investor buys a one-year instrument.

_Alternative 2:_ Investor buys a six-month instrument; when it matures in

six months, the investor buys another six-month instrument.

With alternative 1, the investor will realize the one-year spot rate, and

that rate is known with certainty. In contrast, with alternative 2, the investor

will realize the six-month spot rate, but the six-month rate six months from

 now is unknown. Therefore, for alternative 2, the rate that will be earned

over one year is not known with certainty. This is illustrated in figure 16.2.

```
Figure 16.2

```

Two alternative one-year investments.

Suppose that this investor expected that six months from now, the sixmonth rate will be higher than it is today. The investor might then feel

alternative 2 would be the better investment. However, this expectation is

not necessarily true. To understand why, and to appreciate why it is

necessary to know what the market's consensus regarding future interest

rates is, let's continue with our illustration.

The investor will be indifferent to the two alternatives if they produce the

same total dollars over the one-year investment horizon. Given the one-year

spot rate, there is some rate on a six-month instrument six months from now

that will make the investor indifferent between the two alternatives. We

denote that rate by _f_ .

The value of _f_ can be readily determined given the one-year spot rate and

the six-month spot rate. If an investor places \$100 in a one-year instrument

 (alternative 1), the total amount in dollars that will be generated at the end of

one year is:

Total dollars at the end of year for alternative 1 = \$100 (1 + _z_ 2) [2],

where _z_ 2 is the one-year spot rate. (Remember, we are working in six-month

periods, so the subscript 2 represents two six-month periods, or one year.)

The proceeds from investing at the six-month spot rate will generate the

following total dollars at the end of six months:

_z_

Total dollars at the end of six months for alternative 2 = \$100 (1 + 1),

where _z_ 1 is the six-month spot rate. If this amount is reinvested at the sixmonth rate six months from now, which we denoted by _f,_ then the total

dollars at the end of one year will be:

_z_

Total dollars at the end of year for alternative 2 = \$100 (1 + 1)(1 + _f_ ).

The investor will be indifferent between the two alternatives if the total

 dollars are the same. Setting the two equations for the total dollars at the end

of one year for the two alternatives equal, we get:

$100 (1 + _z_ 2) [2] = $100 (1 + _z_ 1)(1 + _f_ ).

Solving the preceding equation for _f_, we get:

Doubling _f_ gives the bond-equivalent yield for the six-month rate six months

from now that we are interested in.

We can illustrate the calculation of _f_ using the theoretical spot rates

shown in table 16.2. From that table, we know that:

Six-month spot rate = 0.080; therefore, _z_ 1 = 0.0400.

One-year spot rate = 0.083; therefore, _z_ 2 = 0.0415.

Substituting into the formula, we have:

Therefore, the forward rate on a six-month security, quoted on a bondequivalent basis, is

8.6% (= 0.043 × 2).

Here is how we use this rate of 8.6%. If the six-month rate six months

from now is less than 8.6%, then the total dollars at the end of one year

would be higher by investing in the one-year instrument (alternative 1). If

the six-month rate six months from now is greater than 8.6%, then the total

dollars at the end of one year would be higher by investing in the six-month

instrument and reinvesting the proceeds six months from now at the sixmonth rate at the time (alternative 2). Of course, if the six-month rate six

months from now is 8.6%, the two alternatives give the same total dollars at

the end of one year.

Now that we have the rate _f_ in which we are interested and we know how

that rate can be used, let's return to the question posed at the outset. From

table 16.2, the six-month spot rate is 8%. Suppose that the investor expects

that six months from now, the six-month rate will be 8.2%. That is, the

investor expects that the six-month rate will be higher than its current level.

Should the investor select alternative 2 because the six-month rate six

months from now is expected to be higher? The answer is no. As explained

in the previous paragraph, if the rate is less than 8.6%, then alternative 1 is

the better alternative. Because this investor expects a rate of 8.2%, then he or

she should select alternative 1, even though he or she expects the six-month

rate to be higher than it is today.

This result is somewhat surprising for some investors. But the reason is

that the market prices its expectations of future interest rates into the rates

- ffered on investments with different maturities. Knowing the market's
consensus regarding future interest rates is critical. The rate that we
determined for _f_ is the market's consensus for the six-month rate six months

from now. A future interest rate calculated from either the spot rates or the

yield curve is called a **forward rate** - r an **implied forward rate** .

Similarly, borrowers need to understand what a forward rate is. For

example, suppose a borrower must choose between a one-year loan and a

series of two six-month loans. If the forward rate is less than the borrower's

expectations of six-month rates six months from now, then the borrower

would be better off with a one-year loan. If instead the borrower's

expectations are that six-month rates six months from now will be less than

the forward rate, the borrower would be better off by choosing a series of

two six-month loans.

The forward rate consists of two elements. The first is when in the future

the rate begins. The second is the length of time for the rate. For example,

the two-year forward rate three years from now means a rate three years

from now for a length of two years. The notation used for a forward rate, _f_,

will have two subscripts, one before _f_ and one after _f,_ as shown: _tfm_ .

The subscript before _f_ is _t_ and is the length of time that the rate applies.

The subscript after _f_ is _m_ and is when the forward rate begins. That is, the

length of time of the forward rate _f_ when the forward rate begins.

Remember our time periods are still six-month periods. Given the

preceding notation, here is what the notation means:

NotationInterpretation for the Forward Rate

1 _[f]_ 12 six-month (1-period) forward rate beginning six years (12 periods) from now

2 _[f]_ 8 - ne-year (2-period) forward rate beginning four years (8 periods) from now

6 _[f]_ 4 three-year (6-period) forward rate beginning two years (4 periods) from now

_[f]_

8 10 four-year (8-period) forward rate beginning five years (10 periods) from now

It can be demonstrated that the formula to compute any forward rate is

Notice that if _t_ = 1, the formula reduces to the one-period (six-month)

forward rate.

To illustrate, for the spot rates shown in table 16.2, suppose that an

investor wants to know the two-year forward rate three years from now. In

terms of the notation, _t_ = 4 and _m_ = 6. Substituting for _t_ and _m_ into the

equation for the forward rate, we have:

_z_

This expression means that the following spot rates are needed: 6 (the threeyear spot rate) and _z_ 10 (the five-year spot rate). From table 16.3, we know:

_z_

6 (the three-year spot rate) = 9.9787%/2 = 4.894% = 0.04894,

_z_

10 (the five-year spot rate) = 13.623%/2 = 6.812% = 0.06812.

Then we have

Therefore, 4 _f_ 6 is equal to 9.755%, and doubling this rate gives 19.510%, the

forward rate on a bond-equivalent basis.

We can verify this result. Investing \$100 for 10 periods at the semiannual

spot rate of 6.812% will produce the following value:

$100(1.06812) [10] = $193.286.

Investing \$100 for six periods at 4.894% and reinvesting the proceeds for

four periods at the forward rate of 9.755% gives the same value:

$100(1.04894) [6] (1.09755) [4] = $193.286.

```
Relationship between spot rates and short-term forward rates
```

Suppose an investor purchases a five-year, zero-coupon Treasury security for

\$58.48 with a maturity value of \$100. The investor could instead buy a sixmonth Treasury bill and reinvest the proceeds every six months for five

years. The number of dollars that will be realized will depend on the sixmonth forward rates. Suppose that the investor can actually reinvest the

proceeds maturing every six months at the implied six-month forward rates.

Let us see how many dollars would accumulate at the end of five years.

The implied six-month forward rates were calculated for the yield curve

given in table 16.2. Letting _ft_ denote the six-month forward rate beginning _t_

six-month periods from now, the semiannual implied forward rates using the

spot rates shown in table 16.2 are:

_f_ 1 = 0.043000, _f_ 2 = 0.050980, _f_ 3 = 0.051005, _f_ 4 = 0.051770,

_f_ 5 = 0.056945, _f_ 6 = 0.060965, _f_ 7 = 0.069310, _f_ 8 = 0.064625,

_f_ 9 = 0.062830.

By investing the \$58.48 at the six-month spot rate of 4% (8% on a bondequivalent basis) and reinvesting at the foregoing forward rates, the number

- f dollars accumulated at the end of five years will be

\$58.48(1.04)(1.043)(1.05098)(1.051005)(1.05177)(1.056945)(1.069310)

(1.064625)(1.06283) = \$100.

Therefore, we see that if the implied forward rates are realized, the \$58.48

investment will produce the same number of dollars as an investment in a

five-year, zero-coupon Treasury security at the five-year spot rate. From this

illustration, we can see that the five-year spot rate is related to the current

six-month spot rate and the implied six-month forward rates.

In general, the relationship between a _t_  - period spot rate, the current sixmonth spot rate, and the implied six-month forward rates is:

_zt_ = [(1 + _z_ 1)(1 + _f_ 1)(1 + _f_ 2)(1 + _f_ 3) … (1 + _ft_ - 1)] [1/] _[t]_ [−1] .

To illustrate how to use this equation, let's look at how the five-year (10period) spot rate is related to the six-month forward rates. Substituting into

the preceding equation the relevant forward rates just given and the oneperiod spot rate of 4% (half of the 8% annual spot rate), we obtain:

_z_

10 = [(1.04)(1.043)(1.05098)(1.051005)(1.05177)(1.056945) (1.060965)

(1.069310)  (1.064625)(1.06283)] [1/10]  - 1 = 5.51%.

Doubling 5.51% gives an annual spot rate of 11.02%, which agrees with the

spot rate given in table 16.2.

**`Forward rate as a hedgeable rate`** A natural question to ask about
forward rates is: How well do they predict future interest rates? Studies
demonstrate that forward rates do not do a good job of predicting future

interest rates. [6] So why do we emphasize understanding forward rates? The

reason, as we demonstrated in our illustration of how to select between two

alternative investments, is that the forward rates indicate how an investor's

expectations must differ from the market consensus for the investor to make

the correct decision.

In our illustration, the six-month forward rate may not be realized, which

is irrelevant. What is important is that the six-month forward rate indicated

to the investor that if expectations about the six-month rate six months from

now are less than 8.6%, the investor would be better-off with alternative 1.

For this reason, as well as for others explained later, some market

participants prefer not to talk about forward rates as being market consensus

rates. Instead, they refer to forward rates as **hedgeable rates** . For example,

by buying the one-year security, the investor was able to hedge the sixmonth rate six months from now.

```
Historical Shapes Observed for the Treasury Yield Curve

```

If we plot the term structure—the yield to maturity, or the spot rate, at

successive maturities against maturity—what is it likely to look like? Figure

16.1 shows three generic shapes that have appeared for the U.S. Treasury

yield curve with some frequency over time. Table 16.4 shows five selected

daily Treasury yield curves in tabular form.

```
Table 16.4

```

U.S. Treasury yield curve for five dates.

Panel A of figure 16.1 shows an upward-sloping yield curve; that is, the

yield rises steadily as maturity increases. This shape is commonly referred to

as a **positively sloped yield curve** . Market participants differentiate

positively sloped yield curves based on the steepness or slope of the curve.

The slope is commonly measured in terms of the maturity spread, where the

maturity spread is the difference between long-term and short-term yields.

Although there are many maturity candidates to use as proxies for long-term

and short-term yields, we'll use the maturity spread between the six-month

and the 30-year yield in our example.

The first two daily yield curves shown in table 16.4 are positively sloped

yield curves. The threeand six-month yields are roughly the same for both

dates. However, the steepness of the slope is different. The maturity spread

between the 30-year and six-month yield (i.e., the three-month/six-month

spread) was 195 basis points (5.73% − 3.78%) on April 23, 2001, and 401

basis points (7.89% − 3.88%) on April 10, 1992. The convention in the

marketplace is to refer to a positively sloped yield curve whose maturity

spread as measured by the six-month and 30-year yields as a **normal yield**

**curve** when the spread is 300 basis points or less; when the maturity spread

is more than 300 basis points, the yield curve is said to be a **steep yield**

**curve** .

When a yield curve's maturity spread increases (or in the parlance of the

market, it "widens"), the yield curve is said to _steepen;_ when the maturity

spread decreases (i.e., "narrows"), the yield curve is said to _flatten._

Panel B of figure 16.1 shows a downward-sloping or **inverted yield**

**curve**, where yields in general decline as maturity increases. There have not

been many instances in the recent history of the U.S. Treasury market of the

yield curve exhibiting this characteristic. The most notable example occurred

in August 1981. Table 16.4 shows the daily yield curve for one day in that

month, on August 14. Treasury yields at the time were at historical highs.

The yield on the two-year was 16.91% and declined for each subsequent

maturity until it reached 13.95% for the 30-year maturity.

Finally, panel C of figure 16.1 shows a **flat yield curve** . Although the

figure suggests that for a flat yield curve, the yields are identical for each

maturity, that is not what is observed. Instead, the yields for all maturities are

similar. The yield curve on January 3, 1990, reported in table 16.4, is an

example. Notice the very small six-month/30-year maturity spread: 10 basis

points. A variant of the flat yield is one in which the yields on short-term and

long-term Treasuries are similar but the yield on intermediate-term

Treasuries is lower.

```
Determinants of the Shape of the Term Structure

```

Two major theories evolved to account for these observed shapes of the yield

curve: **expectations theory** and **market segmentation theory** _._

The expectations theory includes several forms: **pure expectations**

**theory**, **liquidity theory**, and **preferred habitat theory** _._ All share a

hypothesis about the behavior of short-term forward rates, and they also

assume that the forward rates in current long-term contracts are closely

related to the market's expectations about future short-term rates. These

three theories differ, however, on whether and how other factors also affect

forward rates.

The pure expectations theory postulates that no systematic factors other

than expected future short-term rates affect forward rates; the liquidity

theory and preferred habitat theory assert that other factors are also involved.

Accordingly, the last two forms of the expectations theory are sometimes

referred to as **biased expectations theories** .

**`Pure expectations theory`** According to the **pure expectations theory**,
the forward rates exclusively represent the expected rates. Thus, the entire
term structure at a given time reflects the market's current expectations of
the family of future short-term rates. According to this view, a rising term
structure, as in panel a of figure 16.1, must indicate that the market expects
short-term rates to rise throughout the relevant future. Similarly, a flat term
structure reflects an expectation that future short-term rates will be mostly
constant, whereas a falling term structure must reflect an expectation that
future short rates will decline steadily.

We can illustrate this theory by considering how an expectation of a

rising short-term future rate would affect the behavior of various market

participants so as to result in a rising yield curve. Assume an initially flat

term structure, and suppose that economic news subsequently leads market

participants to expect interest rates to rise.

1. Those market participants interested in a long-term investment
would not want to buy long-term bonds, because they would expect the
yield structure to rise sooner or later, resulting in a price decline for the
bonds and a capital loss on the long-term bonds purchased. Instead,
they would want to invest in short-term debt obligations until the rise in
yield occurred, permitting them to reinvest their funds at the higher
yield.

2. Speculators expecting rising rates would anticipate a decline in the
price of long-term bonds and therefore would want to sell any longterm bonds they own and possibly to "short sell" some they do not now

  - wn. [7] (Should interest rates rise as expected, the price of longer-term
bonds will fall. If the speculator sells these bonds short and then
purchases them at a lower price to cover the short sale, a profit is
earned.) The proceeds received from the selling of long-term debt
issues that the speculators now hold or the shorting of longer-term
bonds will be invested in short-term debt obligations.

3. Borrowers wishing to acquire long-term funds would be pulled
toward borrowing now, at the long end of the market, by the
expectation that borrowing at a later time would be more expensive.

All these responses would tend either to lower the net demand for, or to

increase the supply of, long-maturity bonds, and two of the responses would

increase the demand for short-term obligations. Clearing of the market

would require a rise in long-term yields in relation to short-term yields; that

is, these actions by investors, speculators, and borrowers would tilt the term

structure upward until it was consistent with expectations of higher future

interest rates. By analogous reasoning, an unexpected event leading to the

expectation of lower future rates would result in the yield curve sloping

downward.

Unfortunately, the pure expectations theory suffers from one

shortcoming, which, qualitatively, is quite serious. It neglects the risks

inherent in investing in bonds and similar instruments. If forward rates were

perfect predictors of future interest rates, then the future prices of bonds

would be known with certainty. The return over any investment period

would be certain and independent of the maturity of the instrument initially

acquired and of the time at which the investor needed to liquidate the

instrument. However, with uncertainty about future interest rates and hence

about future prices of bonds, these instruments become risky investments in

the sense that the return over some investment horizon is unknown.

Similarly, from a borrower's or issuer's perspective, the cost of

borrowing for any required period of financing would be certain and

independent of the maturity of the instrument initially sold if the rate at

which the borrower would have to refinance debt in the future were known.

But with uncertainty about future interest rates, the cost of borrowing is

uncertain if the borrower must refinance at some time over the periods in

which the funds are initially needed.

In the following section, we examine more closely the sources and types

- f risk that the pure expectations theory ignores.

**`Risks associated with bond investment`** Two risks cause uncertainty
about the return over some investment horizon. The first is the uncertainty
about the price of the bond at the end of the investment horizon. For
example, an investor who plans to invest for five years might consider the
following three investment alternatives: (1) invest in a five-year bond and
hold it for five years, (2) invest in a 12-year bond and sell it at the end of
five years, or (3) invest in a 30-year bond and sell it at the end of five years.
The return that will be realized for the second and third alternatives is not

known, because the price of each long-term bond at the end of five years is

not known. In the case of the 12-year bond, the price will depend on the

yield on seven-year debt securities five years from now, and the price of the

30-year bond will depend on the yield on 25-year bonds five years from

now. Because forward rates implicit in the current term structure for a future

12-year bond and a future 25-year bond are not perfect predictors of the

actual future rates, the price for both bonds five years from now remains

uncertain.

The risk that the price of the bond will be lower than currently expected

at the end of the investment horizon is called **price risk** . An important

feature of price risk is that it is greater the longer the maturity of the bond.

The reason should be familiar from our discussion in chapter 15: the longer

the maturity is, the greater will be the price volatility of a bond when yields

rise. Thus, investors are exposed to price risk when they invest in a bond that

will be sold before the bond's maturity date.

The second risk has to do with uncertainty about the rate at which the

proceeds from a bond that matures before the end of the investment horizon

can be reinvested until the investment horizon. For example, an investor who

plans to invest for five years might consider the following three alternative

investments: (1) invest in a five-year bond and hold it for five years; (2)

invest in a six-month instrument and, when it matures, reinvest the proceeds

in six-month instruments over the entire five-year investment horizon; and

(3) invest in a two-year bond and, when it matures, reinvest the proceeds in a

three-year bond. The risk in the second and third alternatives is that the

return over the five-year investment horizon is unknown, because the rates at

which the proceeds can be reinvested until maturity are unknown. This risk

is referred to as **reinvestment risk** .

**`Interpretations of pure expectations theory`** Several interpretations

- f the pure expectations theory have been put forth by economists. These
interpretations are not equivalent; nor are they consistent with one another,
in large part because they offer different treatments of the two risks
associated with realizing a return that we have just explained. [8]

The broadest interpretation of the pure expectations theory suggests that

investors expect the return for any investment horizon to be the same,

regardless of the maturity strategy selected. [9] To illustrate, let's consider an

investor with a five-year investment horizon. According to the pure

expectations theory, it makes no difference whether a five-year, 12-year, or

30-year bond is purchased and held for five years because the investor

expects the return from all three bonds to be the same over five years. A

major criticism of this broad interpretation of the theory is that, because of

price risk associated with investing in bonds with a maturity greater than the

investment horizon, the expected returns from these three different bond

investments should differ in significant ways. [10]

A second interpretation, referred to as the **local expectations** form of the

pure expectations theory, suggests that the return will be the same over a

short-term investment horizon starting today. For example, if an investor has

a six-month investment horizon, buying a five-year, 10-year, or 20-year bond

will produce the same six-month return. Studies demonstrate that the local

expectations formulation, which is narrow in scope, is the only one of the

interpretations of the pure expectations theory that can be sustained in

equilibrium. [11]

The third and final interpretation of the pure expectations theory suggests

that the return that an investor will realize by rolling over short-term bonds

to some investment horizon will be the same as the return from holding a

zero-coupon bond with a maturity identical to the investment horizon. (A

zero-coupon bond has no reinvestment risk, so future interest rates over the

investment horizon do not affect the return.) This variant is called the

**return-to-maturity expectations** interpretation. For example, let's once

again assume that an investor has a five-year investment horizon. By buying

a five-year zero-coupon bond and holding it to maturity, the investor's return

is the difference between the maturity value and the price of the bond, all

divided by the price of the bond. According to return-to-maturity

expectations, the same return will be realized by buying a six-month

instrument and rolling it over every six months for five years. The validity of

this interpretation is subject to considerable doubt.

**`Liquidity theory`** We explained that the drawback of the pure
expectations theory is that it does not consider the risks associated with
investing in bonds. Nonetheless, we have just shown that risk is indeed
involved in holding a long-term bond for one period, and that risk increases
with the bond's maturity, because maturity and price volatility are directly
related.

Given this uncertainty, and the reasonable consideration that investors

typically do not like uncertainty, some economists and financial analysts

suggest a different theory. This theory states that investors will hold longerterm maturities if they are offered a long-term rate higher than the average of

expected future rates by a risk premium that is positively related to the term

to maturity. [12] Put differently, the forward rates should reflect both interest

rate expectations and a "liquidity" premium (really a risk premium), and the

premium should be higher for longer maturities.

According to this theory, which is called the **liquidity theory of the term**

**structure**, the implicit forward rates will not be an unbiased estimate of the

market's expectations of future interest rates, because they embody a

liquidity premium. Thus, an upward-sloping yield curve may reflect

expectations that future interest rates either (1) will rise or (2) will be flat or

even fall, but with a liquidity premium increasing fast enough with maturity

so as to produce an upward-sloping yield curve.

**`Preferred habitat theory`** Another theory, known as the **preferred**
**habitat theory**, also adopts the view that the term structure reflects the
expectation of the future path of interest rates as well as a risk premium.
However, the habitat theory rejects the assertion that the risk premium must
rise uniformly with maturity. [13] Proponents of the habitat theory say that the
latter conclusion could be accepted if all investors intend to liquidate their
investment at the first possible date, and all borrowers are eager to borrow
long, but that assumption can be rejected for two reasons.

First, it is obvious that many investors wish to carry resources forward

for appreciable periods of time—to buy a house, for example, or to provide

for retirement. Such investors are concerned with the amount available at the

appropriate time and not the path by which that goal is reached. Hence, risk

aversion dictates that they should prefer an instrument with a maturity

matching the period for which they wish to invest over shorter-term

investment vehicles. If these investors buy a shorter-term instrument, they

will bear reinvestment risk—the risk of a fall in the interest rates available

for reinvesting the proceeds of the shorter-term instrument. Investors can

avoid that risk only by locking in the current long rate through a long-term

contract. Similarly, if they buy an instrument with a maturity longer than the

time they wish to invest for, they will bear the risk of a loss in the price of

the asset (price risk) when liquidating it before its maturity, because of a rise

in interest rates. Entirely analogous considerations apply to borrowers:

Prudence and safety call for borrowing for a maturity by matching the length

- f time for which funds are required.

Second, a lot of the demand for and supply of securities these days come

from financial intermediaries, which have liabilities with specified

maturities. These institutions seek to match as closely as possible the

maturity of their liabilities with the cash flow of a portfolio of assets. When

constructing such a portfolio, a financial institution will restrict its

investments to certain maturity sectors.

To illustrate this preference for maturity sectors, let's consider a life

insurance company that issues a five-year guaranteed investment contract. [14]

The insurance company will not want to invest in six-month instruments

because of the associated reinvestment risk. As another example, assume a

thrift borrows funds at a fixed rate for one year with the proceeds from the

issuance of a one-year certificate of deposit. The thrift is exposed to price (or

interest rate) risk if the borrowed funds are invested in a bond with 20 years

to maturity. Clearly, then, either of these institutions faces some kind of risk

if it invests outside its preferred maturity sector.

The preferred habitat theory asserts that, to the extent that the demand

and supply of funds in a given maturity range do not match, some lenders

and borrowers will be induced to shift to maturities showing the opposite

imbalances. However, they need to be compensated by an appropriate risk

premium whose magnitude reflects the extent of aversion to either price or

reinvestment risk.

Thus, this theory proposes that the shape of the yield curve is determined

by both expectations of future interest rates and a risk premium, positive or

negative, to induce market participants to shift out of their preferred habitat.

Clearly, according to this theory, yield curves sloping up, down, flat, or

humped are all possible.

**`Market segmentation theory`** The **market segmentation theory** also
recognizes that investors' preferred habitats dictate saving and investment
flows. It also proposes that the major reason for the shape of the yield curve
lies in asset/liability management constraints (either regulatory or selfimposed) and/or creditors (borrowers) restricting their lending (financing) to
specific maturity sectors. [15] However, the market segmentation theory differs
from the preferred habitat theory in that it assumes that neither investors nor
borrowers are willing to shift from one maturity sector to another to take
advantage of opportunities arising from differences between expectations
and forward rates.

Thus, for segmentation theory, the shape of the yield curve is determined

by the supply of and demand for securities within each maturity sector. This

formulation seems untenable: It presupposes the prevalence of absolute risk

aversion, but the evidence does not support that proposition. Thus, market

participants must be expected to shift away from their habitat when

sufficiently large discrepancies occur between market and expected rates.

This potential shifting ensures that the differences between market and

expected rates will not grow too large, and this consideration leads back to

the preferred habitat theory.

```
Key Points

```

- Every economy operates not just with one interest rate but rather with a
structure of interest rates.

   - The yield spread is the difference between the yield on any two bonds
and reflects the difference in their risks.

  - A country's government bond market can be used as the base or
benchmark interest rate for that country.

   - The base interest rate is equal to the real rate of interest plus the
expected rate of inflation.

  - The risk premium is the yield spread between a nongovernment
security and a comparable government security.

   - The factors that affect the yield spread include (1) the type of issuer
(agency, corporation, or municipality), (2) the issuer's perceived
creditworthiness as measured by the rating system of credit rating
agencies, (3) the term or maturity of the instrument, (4) the embedded

   - ptions in a bond issue (e.g., call, put, or conversion provisions), (5) the
taxability of interest income at the federal and municipal levels, and (6)
the expected liquidity of the issue.

   - The swap rate yield curve also provides information about interest
rates in a country.

   - The swap rate yield curve, or simply "swap curve," is not a defaultfree yield curve but rather reflects interbank credit risk.
   - In many countries, market participants use the country's swap curve
as the benchmark interest rate rather than the country's government
bond yield curve.

- The term structure of interest rates refers to the relationship between
yield and maturity for comparable bonds.

- The yield curve is the graphical depiction of the relationship between
the yield on bonds of the same credit quality but different maturities.

- Historically, the yield on Treasury securities is the benchmark rate
used for the yield on nongovernment bonds; consequently, the most
commonly constructed yield curve is the Treasury yield curve.

- A problem arises with using the Treasury yield curve to determine the
- ne yield at which to discount all the cash payments of any bond.
- Each cash flow in a bond's total pattern of cash flows should be
discounted at a unique interest rate that is applicable to the period when
the cash flow is to be received.

- Any bond can be viewed as a package of zero-coupon instruments, so
its value should equal the value of all the component zero-coupon
instruments.

- The spot rate is the rate on a zero-coupon bond.
- The rate on a zero-coupon security can be estimated from the
Treasury yield curve using a method known as bootstrapping.

- Under certain assumptions, the market's expectation of future interest
rates can be extrapolated from the theoretical Treasury spot rate curve.
The resulting forward rate is referred to as the implicit forward rate.

- The spot rate is related to the current six-month spot rate and the
implicit six-month forward rates.

- A knowledge of the forward rates implicit in the current long-term
rate is relevant when formulating both investment strategies and
borrowing policies.

- Several theories have been proposed as to the determination of the

term structure.

- The pure expectations theory hypothesizes that the one-period
forward rates simply represent the market's expectations of future
actual rates; thus, the long-term spot rate would itself be explained fully
by the market expectations of future short rates.

- According to the pure expectations theory, the term structure might
be positive, negative, or flat, depending on whether the market expects
rising, falling, or unchanged short-term rates, respectively.

- The pure expectations theory fails to recognize the risks associated
with investing in bonds—price risk and reinvestment risk—when
investors buy bonds whose maturity is different from the time for which
they plan to hold the bond.

- The price risk of investing in long-term bonds, and the fact that the
risk increases with maturity, gives rise to an alternative: the liquidity
theory of the term structure.

- According to the liquidity theory of the term structure of interest
rates, forward rates are the sum of expected future rates and a risk
premium that increases for increasingly distant future rates and, hence,
rises with the maturity of a bond.

- The liquidity theory of the term structure of interest rates has
shortcomings, because it presupposes that all lenders want to lend short
and all borrowers want to borrow long; if so, long borrowers must offer
lenders a premium, rising with maturity, to accept the risk of going
long.

- In reality, both lenders and borrowers vary substantially in their
maturity preferences, with each market participant being able to
eliminate risk not by borrowing or lending short but by lending (or
borrowing) for a period coinciding with his or her preferred habitat. But
at the same time, agents could presumably be induced to depart from
their preferred habitat with the availability of a risk premium.

- Although the preferred habitat version of the expectations theory
suggests, like the liquidity theory, that forward rates are the sum of a
component reflecting expected future rates and a risk premium, that
premium will not rise continuously with maturity but will materialize in
any maturity neighborhood where supply exceeds demand.

- According to the preferred habitat theory, a negative premium or
discount would be expected if supply exceeded demand.

   - One theory of the term structure explains the shape of the term
structure by the concept of market segmentation.

  - In common with the preferred habitat theory, the market
segmentation theory recognizes that participants in the bond market
have maturity preferences; however, it postulates that these preferences
are absolute and cannot be overcome by the expectation of a higher
return from a different maturity, no matter how large the return.

  - Proponents of the market segmentation theory argue that each
maturity is a separate market and that the interest rate in every such
market is determined by the given demand and supply; consequently,
the interest rate at any maturity is totally unrelated to expectations of
future rates.

   - This market segmentation theory is of doubtful use in reality, because
it implies highly irrational, implausible, and counterfactual behavior.

1. The term "benchmark interest rates" has also been used to describe nearly risk-free short-term
reference interest rates, such as the "IBORS" that we describe in chapter 25—the three major ones
being the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), and
Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR).

3., chapter 6.

4. See http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/yield
_historical_main.shtml.

5. In practice, the Treasury securities that are used to construct the theoretical spot rate curve are the
most recently auctioned Treasury securities of a given maturity (i.e., the on-the-run Treasury issues).
As we explain in chapter 20, there are actual zero-coupon Treasury securities with a maturity greater
than one year that are outstanding in the market. These securities are not issued by the U.S. Treasury
but are created by certain market participants from actual coupon Treasury securities. It would seem
logical that the observed yield on zero-coupon Treasury securities could be used to construct an actual
spot rate curve, but this approach has problems. First, the liquidity of these securities is not as great as
that of the coupon Treasury market. Second, some maturity sectors of the zero-coupon Treasury
market attract specific investors who may be willing to trade off yield in exchange for an attractive
feature associated with that particular maturity sector, thereby distorting the term structure
relationship.

purpose of this illustration.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the difference between primary and secondary markets;
   - the principles for regulating a primary market;

With an initial investment from various private investors, in September

1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin raised \$1 million to start Google Inc.;

that is, they did not offer Google's common stock to the public. On April

29, 2004, Google Inc. filed an initial public offering (IPO) (a first-time

- ffering of a private company of its common stock to the public) with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On August 19, 2004,
shares were sold to the public, making Google a public corporation. As
explained in chapter 1, financial markets can be categorized as those
dealing with financial claims that are newly issued, called the **primary**
**market**, and those for exchanging financial claims previously issued, called
the **secondary market**, or the market for seasoned securities. It was in the
primary market that Google, as well as other startup companies, raised
funds through an IPO. The primary market involves the distribution to
investors of newly issued securities or seasoned securities issues issued by a
corporation to the public. This market also includes the offering of
securities of government-owned companies to private investors, a process
referred to as .
**privatization**

The participants in the marketplace that work with issuers to distribute

newly issued securities are investment bankers, entities described in chapter

9. In that chapter, we described the traditional process of underwriting of

securities and how investment bankers perform at least one of three

functions: (1) advising the issuer on the terms and the timing of the

- ffering, (2) buying the securities from the issuer, and (3) distributing the
issue to the public.

In this chapter, we explain primary markets, focusing on the regulations

followed by many developed countries and the various ways in which new

securities are issued. In chapter 28 we describe the various financial

instruments that can be used by start-up companies to raise funds. We begin

with a description of the regulation of the primary market in the United

States and then discuss regulation in other countries. In chapter 18, we

cover the secondary market.

```
Regulation of the Primary Market

```

Entities seeking to raise funds in every developed country are required to

comply with that country's securities laws. In the United States, for

example, there are two principal pieces of federal legislation regarding

securities, the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Subsequent legislation has amended

various regulations of both acts, with major amendments with respect to

fundraising resulting from the major financial crises that have occurred in

the intervening years. These amendments include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

- f 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
- f 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), and the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of
2012 (the JOBS Act).

In Japan, the Securities and Exchange Law of 1948 is the counterpart to

the U.S. Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act. This act and Japan's

Commercial Code and Civil Codes are the principal regulations dealing

with securities in Japan.

The U.S. federal agency responsible for administrating federal securities

laws as set forth in these 1933 and 1934 acts is the SEC. State laws, also

referred to as "blue sky laws," are administered by a designated agency

responsible for regulating the sales of securities in the state. The Financial

Industry Regulatory Authority is the self-regulating entity in the United

States, which in 2007 replaced the National Association of Securities

Dealers. In Japan, the Ministry of Finance is the key regulator; the

Securities Dealer's Association, an entity composed of member security

companies, is the second most powerful regulator. The Canadian Securities

Administrators (Canada), Financial Services Authority (United Kingdom),

Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Australia), and

Commission Nacional del Mercado de Valores (Spain) are examples of the

principal regulators in other countries.

In all countries, securities laws dealing with the primary market cover

three critical issues:

how a "security" is defined,

disclosure requirements when securities are issued, and

the solicitation of funds.

```
Defining a Security

```

The securities law of all countries begins with defining what a security is. It

is natural to think of the financial products that we describe in later chapters

in this book as securities (stocks and bonds). Although the term "security"

has been used throughout this book interchangeably with "financial

instrument," in terms of security law, it has a far broader meaning than just

stocks and bonds. The decision in a 1946 landmark Supreme Court case

(SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.) involving land sales contracts has been used to

determine whether a transaction falls in the realm of a "securities"

transaction. The court ruled that "an investment contract for purposes of the

Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person

invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely

from the efforts of the promoter or a third party." It does not make a

difference whether there is a formal certificate or nominal interests in the

physical assets that may be used by the entity obtaining funds.

The definition of a security as provided by the Supreme Court in the

Howey decision has been applied in the analysis of whether a transaction is

a security transaction in matters involving shares in fishing boats, sale of

franchises, sale of cemetery lots, and housing cooperative shares. In fact, a

2004 Supreme Court decision in a matter involving the public sale of pay

phones by ETS Payphones Inc. found the arrangement to be a security

transaction. The transaction involved the sale and leaseback arrangement

for pay phones. Although lower courts indicated that this type of transaction

was not a security transaction, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that it

was, thereby reaffirming the Howey decision. The U.S. courts have ruled

that when an investment is made in an entity for a reason other than for

profit or financial gain, the investment instrument is not a security. For

example, in a 1975 case involving an investment by certain individuals in a

cooperative housing project (United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Foreman),

the court ruled that the investment by the individuals was for the purpose of

- btaining a residence and not for financial gain or profit.

```
Disclosure Requirements

```

There are two basic objectives of the U.S. Securities Act, and they are

typically also the objectives in other countries. The first objective deals

with the disclosure of information about the securities that an entity is

planning to issue. Disclosure is accomplished by the issuance of a

**prospectus** that provides "full and fair disclosure of the character of

securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails."

The second objective of the Securities Act is to prevent the sale of securities

as a result of deceit, misrepresentation, and other fraud. These two

- bjectives of the Securities Act deal with the initial distribution of securities
and the registration of those securities, whereas the Exchange Act deals
with the secondary market for securities by mandating ongoing periodic
reporting of financial information to investors.

In other countries, the securities laws dealing with the primary market

regarding disclosure are similar to those of the United States. The

prospectus for a new offering is required for entities seeking to issue

securities in the European Union (EU), for example. Under the EU rules,

when an issuer obtains approval of its prospectus by a member country in

the EU, it is valid for the issuance of securities in all EU countries. This is

popularly referred to as a "single passport for issuers," and the rationale is

that it ensures at least minimum protection of investors regardless of the EU

country where the securities are purchased.

Regulators of the primary market throughout the world periodically

revise their prospectus requirements. In fact, many countries have

regulations for simplified and "plain language" disclosure rules that should

be followed by issuers (i.e., the creation of a plain language prospectus).

The SEC adopted plain English disclosure rules in 1998 in public offerings

by domestic and foreign issuers. Specifically, the SEC expects that issuers

comply with six principles of plain English when preparing the summary

and factor sections provided on the front and back cover pages of a

prospectus: use short sentences; use definite, concrete, and everyday

language; use an active voice; use when possible a tabular presentation or

bullet points; avoid using legal jargon or business terms that are highly

technical; and avoid double negatives. For the prospectus as a whole, the

rules require that the issuer be "clear, concise and understandable." There

are much more detailed rules than described here, but the key is just better

communication about the company, its business, and its risks.

In the same year that the United States adopted its plain language

prospectus rules, several other countries followed suit. For example, Hong

Kong's Securities and Futures Commission published "Project on the Use

- f Plain Language: How to Create a Clear Prospectus" that contained
sample prospectuses. [1]

A study conducted by the European Commission in 2015 (referred to as

a "consultation") identified the shortcomings of the EU prospectus

requirements. For issuers, the study reported that the rules constitute a

considerable amount of legal paperwork and, particularly for smaller firms,

it was costly to prepare a prospectus. The study also indicated that investors

found it difficult to read through the hundreds of pages of a prospectus that

followed these rules. As a result, in June 2017, the EU adopted Regulation

(EU) 2017/1129 to mitigate these problems.

**`SEC`** **`filing requirements`** Unless an exemption can be obtained or
special rules apply (such as for smaller reporting companies), the SEC
requires that a company file the documents described in box 17.1. The
Securities Act provides for penalties in the form of fines, imprisonment, or
both if the information provided is inaccurate or material information is

- mitted. Moreover, investors who purchased the security are entitled to sue
the issuer to recover damages if they incurred a loss as a result of

misleading information. The underwriter may also be sued if it can be

demonstrated that the underwriter did not conduct a reasonable

investigation of the information reported by the issuer.

```
Box 17.1

```

**Required Filings with the SEC**

_**Registration statement:**_ The initial registration filing with the SEC, Form S-1, must contain

financial accounting information, as well as a description of the business, the securities, the risk

factors faced by investors, and how the proceeds received will be used. The financial statements

that are required to be included are audited balance sheets for each of the two most recent fiscal

years, audited statements of income and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding

the date of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such shorter period as the

company has been in existence, and interim financial statements.

_**10-K report:**_ Form 10-K must be filed on an annual basis with the SEC within 90 days after the

end of the company's fiscal year. Form 10-K consists of the following three sections: (1) a

business summary, (2) management discussion and analysis, and (3) audited financial statements

(balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, and statement of changes in

stockholders' equity).

_**10-Q report:**_ Form 10-Q is similar to Form 10-K but must be filed quarterly, not just annually,

and much less detailed information is required. The financial statements are unaudited but

subject to a review.

_**8-K report:**_ Form 8-K is an occasional filing; it must be filed if a certain event occurs. Examples

 - f such events are entering bankruptcy or receivership, completion of an acquisition or
disposition of assets, the departure of directors or principal officers, election of directors or the
appointment of principal officers, and changes in control. Form 8-K must be filed within four
business days of the event.

_**Proxy statement:**_ Information about the issues to be voted on by shareholders and

management's recommendation are provided in the proxy statement issued by a company.

_**Forms 3, 4, and 5:**_ Forms 3, 4, and 5 are filings with the SEC that contain information on the

 - wnership of securities by corporate insiders (i.e., officers and directors) and any beneficial
 - wners (i.e., owners of more than 10% of the company's equity securities), and how that
 - wnership changes over time.

_**Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G reports:**_ The "beneficial owner" of a company is defined by

the SEC as any person who directly or indirectly shares voting power or investment power (the

power to sell the security). Schedule 13D, commonly referred to as the "beneficial ownership

report," must be filed when a person or group of persons acquires beneficial ownership of more

than 5% of a voting class of a company's equity registered within 10 days after the purchase.

Schedule 13G is similar to Schedule 13D but requires less information when the person

acquiring the shares is only a passive investor with no intention of altering or influencing the

control of the issuer.

One of the most important duties of an underwriter is to perform due

diligence. The following excerpt is taken from a court decision that explains

the obligation of an underwriter to perform due diligence:

An underwriter by participating in an offering constructively represents that statements made in the

registration materials are complete and accurate. The investing public properly relies upon the

underwriter to check the accuracy of the statements and the soundness of the offer; when the

underwriter does not speak out, the investor reasonably assumes that there are no undisclosed

material deficiencies. The representations in the registration statement are those of the underwriter as

much as they are those of the issuer. [2]

The filing of a registration statement with the SEC does not mean that

the security can be offered to the public. The registration statement must be

reviewed and approved by the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance before

the security can be offered to the public. Typically, the staff of this division

will find a problem with the registration statement. The staff then sends a

"letter of comments" or "deficiency letter" to the issuer explaining the

problem it encountered. The issuer must then remedy any problem by filing

an amendment to the registration statement. If the SEC staff is then

satisfied, it will issue an order declaring that the registration statement is

"effective," and the underwriter can solicit sales. The approval of the SEC,

however, does not mean that the securities have investment merit or are

properly priced or that the information is accurate. It merely means that the

appropriate information appears to have been disclosed.

The time interval between the initial filing of the registration statement

and the time the registration statement becomes effective is referred to as

the "waiting period." During the waiting period, the SEC does allow the

underwriters to distribute a preliminary prospectus. Because the prospectus

is not effective, the cover page of the prospectus states this status in red ink,

and as a result, the preliminary prospectus is commonly referred to as a "red

herring." During the waiting period, the underwriter cannot sell the security,

nor may it accept written offers from investors to buy the security.

A closely related concept is the "quiet period." The SEC prohibits

management teams or their marketing staff from making forecasts or

expressing opinions about the value of the company prior to an IPO. In

addition, for publicly traded stocks, for four weeks before the close of the

business quarter, corporate insiders cannot speak to the public about the

company's business, usually to avoid the appearance of inside information.

**`Self-registration rule`** In 1982, the SEC approved **Rule 415**, which
permits certain issuers to file a single registration document indicating that
it intends to sell a certain amount of a certain class of securities at one or

more times in the next two years. Rule 415 is popularly referred to as the

**shelf registration rule**, because the securities can be viewed as sitting on a

"shelf" and can be taken off that shelf and sold to the public without

- btaining additional SEC approval.

In essence, the filing of a single registration document allows the issuer

to come to market quickly, because the sale of the security has been

preapproved by the SEC. Prior to the establishment of Rule 415, a lengthy

period was required before a security could be sold to the public. As a

result, in a fast-moving market, issuers could not come to market quickly

with an offering to take advantage of what it perceived to be attractive

financing opportunities. For example, if a corporation felt that interest rates

were attractive and wanted to issue a bond, it had to file a registration

statement and could not issue the bond until the registration statement

became effective. The corporation then took the chance that during the

waiting period, interest rates might rise, making the bond offering more

costly.

**`U.S. exemption rules`** In most countries, unless an exemption is set forth
in a country's securities law, an entity seeking to raise funds through a
transaction that is defined as a security must register that security with
regulators. Even if an entity can find an exemption to registering the
security with regulators, the country's securities law still will have
restrictions with respect to general solicitation or general advertising in
connection with the offering of securities.

In the United States, the JOBS Act facilitated raising funds by requiring

that the SEC amend Rule 144A of the Securities Act, which is a private

- ffering exemption for a nonpublic offering of securities. This exemption
from registration applies to the resale of securities to what the SEC
classifies as qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). The SEC defines a QIB

as a large, sophisticated organization with the primary responsibility of

managing large investment portfolios with at least \$100 million in securities

and that is recognized by regulators as needing less protection from issuers

than the typical public investor. Prior to the JOBS Act, Rule 144A required

that securities be offered for resale only to QIBs. With the JOBS Act, Rule

144A was amended so that offers of securities can be made to investors

who are not QIBs as long as the securities are sold only to persons whom

the seller reasonably believes are QIBs.

In the United States, two other exemptions are provided for in the

Securities Act: the intrastate offering exemption and the private offering

exemption. The Securities Act allows an exemption for securities sold

within a state (i.e., intrastate), which is accordingly referred to as the

"intrastate offering exemption." The three conditions that must be satisfied

to qualify for the intrastate offering exemption are (1) the issuer must be

incorporated in the state where the securities are to be offered; (2) the issuer

must do a significant amount of its business in the state where the securities

are to be offered; and (3) the securities must be offered and subsequently

sold only to bona fide residents of the state. The private offering exemption,

also referred to as the "nonpublic offering exemption" or the "private

placement exemption," exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any

public offering. Three requirements must be satisfied by the buyers. They

must (1) either be capable of evaluating the investment risks and attributes

- f the security or be able to bear the economic risks associated with the
security, (2) have access to the type of information typically provided in a
prospectus for a registered security, and (3) agree not to resell or distribute
the security to the public.

**`Private placement of securities`** Public and private offerings of
securities differ in terms of the regulatory requirements that must be
satisfied by the issuer. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 require that all securities offered to the general
public be registered with the SEC, unless given a specific exemption. The
securities acts allow three exemptions from federal registration. First,
intrastate offerings—that is, securities sold only within a state—are exempt.

Second, a small-offering exemption (Regulation A) specifically applies if

the offering is for \$1 million or less, in which case the securities need not be

registered. Finally, Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act exempts from registration

"transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering." However, the

1933 act does not provide specific guidelines to identify what is a private

- ffering or placement.

In 1982, the SEC adopted Regulation D, which sets forth the specific

guidelines that must be satisfied to qualify for exemption from registration

under Section 4(2). The guidelines require that, in general, the securities not

be offered through any form of general advertising or general solicitation

that would prevail for public offerings. Most important, the guidelines

restrict the sale of securities to "sophisticated" investors. Such "accredited"

investors are defined as those (1) with the capability to evaluate (or who can

afford to employ an adviser to evaluate) the risk and return characteristics

- f the securities and (2) with the resources to bear the economic risks. [3]

The exemption of an offering does not mean that the issuer need not

disclose information to potential investors. The issuer must still furnish the

same information deemed material by the SEC. This information is

provided in a private placement memorandum, as opposed to a prospectus

for a public offering. The distinction between the private placement

memorandum and the prospectus is that the former does not include

information deemed by the SEC to be "non-material," whereas such

information is required in a prospectus. Moreover, unlike a prospectus, the

private placement memorandum is not subject to SEC review.

In the United States, one restriction imposed on buyers of privately

placed securities is that the securities may not be resold for two years after

acquisition. Thus, the market contains no liquidity for that time period.

Buyers of privately placed securities must be compensated for the lack of

liquidity, which raises the cost to the issuer of the securities.

In April 1990, however, SEC Rule 144A became effective. This rule

eliminates the two-year holding period by permitting large institutions to

trade securities acquired in a private placement among them without having

to register these securities with the SEC. Under Rule 144A, a large

institution is defined as one holding at least \$100 million of the security.

Private placements are now classified as Rule 144A offerings or non-Rule

144A offerings. The latter are more commonly referred to as "traditional

private placements." Rule 144A offerings are underwritten by investment

bankers.

Rule 144A encourages foreign corporations to issue securities in the

U.S. private placement market for two reasons. First, it will attract new

large institutional investors into the market who were unwilling previously

to buy private placements because of the requirement to hold the securities

for two years. Such an increase in the number of institutional investors may

encourage foreign-based entities to issue securities. Second, foreign entities

had been unwilling to raise funds in the United States prior to the

establishment of Rule 144A, because they had to register their securities

and furnish the necessary disclosure set forth by U.S. securities laws.

Private placement requires less disclosure. Rule 144A also improves

liquidity, reducing the cost of raising funds.

```
Solicitation of Funds

```

When an issuer seeks to raise funds, it must use one or more methods for

soliciting potential investors, such as direct mailing, advertising, or Internet

postings. Securities laws typically cover the methods that may be used by

issuers for the solicitation of funds.

In the United States, for example, SEC Rule 502(c) provides guidance

- n what types of activity constitute general solicitation and advertising;
they include placing advertisements in newspapers and magazines,
advertising on television and radio broadcasts, and sponsoring seminars to
which attendees have been invited by general solicitation. Even with the
general guidance provided by the SEC, it is still not simple to determine
what constitutes general solicitation and advertising, and it is the SEC's
position that what constitutes general solicitation is a matter of particular
facts and circumstances.

In the United States, a common exemption that may be used by an entity

to avoid the ban on general soliciting and advertising is Rule 506 of

Regulation D of the Securities Act. This rule allows an issuer to raise an

unlimited amount of capital from up to 35 accredited investors and up to 35

nonaccredited investors. The term "accredited investor" has a specific

meaning, defined in Regulation D. There are individual accredited investors

and institutional accredited investors. An **individual accredited investor** is

an individual who meets certain annual income and/or net worth

thresholds. [4] An **institutional accredited investor** includes such entities as

banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and venture capital funds.

In July 2013, the SEC was forced to adopt a new set of rules that

removed, under special circumstances, the ban on general solicitation and

advertising. This was the result of the JOBS Act of 2012, which was passed

by Congress to stimulate economic recovery in the United States by making

it easier for small companies and startups to find investors, with the

expectation that employment opportunities would increase. Although the

JOBS Act directed the SEC to remove the ban on general solicitation and

advertising for securities offerings, it still placed two obligations on entities

seeking to raise funds. First, sales had to be limited to accredited investors.

Second, the issuer of the security had to undertake "reasonable steps" to

verify that all buyers of the security were, in fact, accredited investors. This

second responsibility of the issuer sounds simple, but its implementation

was not, because it came with a complicated set of principles established by

the SEC to determine what constitutes "reasonable steps" to ensure that one

is soliciting an accredited investor. Despite the difficulty of implementation

in practice, the JOBS Act removed restrictions on the soliciting of investors

so long as those investors are accredited investors.

Variations in the Underwriting of Securities

```

In our discussion in chapter 9 of the role of investment bankers, we

described the traditional syndication process; however, not all deals are

underwritten using this process. Variations include the "bought deal" for the

underwriting of bonds, the auction process for both stocks and bonds, and a

rights offering for common stock.

```
Issuance via a Bought Deal

```

A **bought deal** refers to the offering of a security (stock or bond) whereby

an underwriter agrees to purchase all of the security from the issuer at a

fixed price without premarketing the deal before purchasing it from the

issuer. The bought deal was introduced in the Eurobond market in 1981,

when Credit Suisse First Boston (now Credit Suisse) purchased from

General Motors Acceptance Corporation a \$100 million issue. Although

initially used for public bond offerings, the bought deal is now also

commonly used for the public offering of equity.

The mechanics of a bought deal are as follows. The lead manager, or a

group of managers, offers a potential issuer of a security a firm bid to

purchase the entire offering of the security. The issuer is given a short

period of time to accept or reject the bid. If the bid is accepted, the

underwriting firm has "bought the deal." It can in turn sell the securities to

- ther investment banking firms for distribution to their clients or distribute
the securities to its own clients. Typically, the underwriting firm that buys
the deal will have presold most of the issue to its institutional clients.

When used in the case of common stock, it is not for an IPO. Instead it is

for the public offering of a seasoned equity offering. That is, the company

already has common stock outstanding and seeks to raise funds. One

method is the marketing of the common stock prior to its offering, which

involves a marketing process that can be quite lengthy. The bought deal,

which is referred to as an "accelerated seasoned common stock offering," is

now the predominate issuance method in North America, and the traditional

firm commitment for seasoned offerings of common stock is rare. [5] Studies

also indicate that it has become the predominate issuance method in

Europe. [6]

For example, in June 2017, Cantor Fitzgerald Canada Corporation, a

subsidiary of the U.S. investment banking firm Cantor Fitzgerald, agreed to

buy on a bought deal basis 31,250,000 common shares of the Canadian

company Prometic Life Sciences for a price \$1.70 per share for gross

proceeds of \$53,125,000.

```
Issuance of a Security via an Auction Process

```

Another variation for the issuance of securities is the auction process, in

which the issuer announces the terms of the issue, and interested parties

submit sealed bids to receive an allotment or all of the securities auctioned.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury uses an auction system for the

allocation of its massive offering of securities. The auction process is also

used by state and local governments in the issuance of bonds and by public

utilities. This process is referred to as a "competitive sale." In the case of

bonds, the bidders are individual underwriters and underwriter syndicates.

The winning underwriter (syndicate) is the one that bids the lowest interest

cost and, on winning the entire offering, reoffers the bonds to its client base.

**`Use of auction for an IPO`** The auction process has also been used for
an IPO offering. In a traditional IPO offering, an investment banking firm
uses its team of equity analysts and its sales force to determine from its

institutional client base at what price a firm going public can sell its shares.

For example, the Twitter IPO on November 7, 2013, was priced at \$26 per

share, as determined by investment bankers, Twitter's lead underwriters

(Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America). An alternative for

an IPO is an auction. Starting in the mid-1990s, several firms in the

technology sector used this form of IPO issuance, among them Yahoo,

Overstock.com, and Google Inc.

Let's first discuss the mechanics of an auction and how the price that

winning bidders must pay is determined, and then look at the relative merits

- f a traditional issuance of an IPO versus an auction. Suppose there are 30
million shares to be issued for an IPO, and the bids and the number of

shares are as in table 17.1.

The first column in the table shows all the bids, with bid price shown in

the second column. So, "A" represents all investors who bid \$50.00, and the

number of shares they bid for in the aggregate is three million. Because

there are 30 million shares to be allotted, the remaining number of shares

(shown in the last column) is 27 million. Looking now at Investors I, at a

bid price of \$34.00, only two million shares remain to be allocated.

Investors J bid at \$32.00 for three million of the remaining two million

shares. So at a price of \$32.00, the market has cleared (i.e., the total number

- f shares will be sold).

The question then is what price the winning bidders (Investors A

through J) will pay. The price will be that of the lowest winning bidder,

\$32.00. That is, a single price will be paid by all bidders. This type of

auction is called a **Dutch auction** . So, even though Investors A bid for three

million shares at \$50.00 per share, they will pay only \$32.00 per share.

Investors K through N will receive no shares. How much will be allocated

to Investors J, who bid for three million of the two million remaining

shares? All those who bid \$32.00 will receive a proportionate allocation.

For example, if Mrs. Chen bid for 3,000 shares at \$32.00, she will be

allocated only 2,000 shares.

For our hypothetical IPO issuer, the amount that will be raised before

any fees is \$960 million.

In August 2004, Google Inc. used a Dutch auction for its IPO, raising

\$2.7 billion. The question is: What is the best method for an IPO: traditional

issuance using the underwriting process with investment bankers or a Dutch

auction? Let’s consider the Twitter IPO on November 7, 2013, priced at \$26

per share as determined by the firm's investment bankers. The valuation for

the firm based on \$26 per share was \$15.2 billion. The opening price at

which it traded on the New York Stock Exchange was \$45.00 per share, and

the closing price was \$44.90 per share. At a share price of \$45.00, the

valuation of the company was \$31.8 billion. Thus, the investment bankers

felt the company was worth \$15.2 billion and the market thought it was

worth \$31.8 billion. Somebody's valuation model was off!

Of course, investment bankers argue that their direct purchase of the

stock in an IPO offering as intermediaries adds value, because they search

their institutional client base, making it likely that the issuer will get the

highest price (proceeds) after adjusting for the underwriting fees. However,

since the 1990s, the measure of a good underwriting seems not to be the

proceeds received by the firm for its IPO but rather the jump in the stock

price at the time of issuance. For example, in the case of Twitter, the pricing

considerably below what the market suggested on the opening day (about

\$45) resulted in substantially less proceeds to Twitter. The beneficiaries

were those who were fortunate enough to get an allocation of shares from

their broker—primarily institutional investors. One of the reasons Google

Inc. selected the Dutch auction was because it was viewed as more

"democratic": It allowed retail investors to participate in the IPO offering.

One argument put forth by investment bankers as to the advantage of the

traditional underwriting process is that the syndicate involved in the

underwriting process can support the market price for a period of time after

issuance. This is because in most such underwritings, the investment

banking firm agrees to stabilize the price in the secondary market to keep it

from falling below the price at which it was sold to the public. One might

think that this constitutes market manipulation. However, it is permitted by

SEC Rule 10b-7, where the SEC sets forth the activities it considers to

constitute market stabilization of a new issue and what it considers market

manipulation.

```
Preemptive Rights Offering

```

A corporation can issue new common stock directly to existing

shareholders through a **preemptive rights offering** . A preemptive right

grants existing shareholders the right to buy some proportion of the new

shares issued at a price below market value. The price at which new shares

can be purchased is called the **subscription price** . A rights offering ensures

that current shareholders can maintain their proportionate equity interest in

the corporation. In the United States, the practice of issuing common stock

by means of a preemptive rights offering is uncommon. In other countries,

it is much more common; in some countries, it is the only means by which a

new offering of common stock may be sold.

For the shares sold through a preemptive rights offering, the

underwriting services of an investment banker are not needed. However, the

issuing corporation may use the services of an investment banker for the

distribution of common stock that is not subscribed to. A **standby**

**underwriting arrangement** will be used in such instances. This

arrangement calls for the underwriter to buy the unsubscribed shares. The

issuing corporation pays a **standby fee** to the investment banking firm.

```
World Capital Markets Integration and Fundraising Implications

```

An entity may seek funds outside its local capital market with the

expectation of doing so at a lower cost than if its funds were raised in its

local capital market. Whether lower costs are possible depends on the

degree of integration of capital markets. At the two extremes, the world

capital markets can be classified as either completely segmented or

completely integrated.

In the former case, investors in one country are not permitted to invest in

the securities issued by an entity in another country. As a result, in a

**completely segmented market**, the required return on securities of

comparable risk traded in different capital markets throughout the world

will be different even after adjusting for taxes and foreign exchange rates.

An entity may be able to raise funds in the capital market of another

country at a lower cost than raising funds in its local capital market.

At the other extreme, a **completely integrated market** contains no

restrictions to prevent investors from investing in securities issued in any

capital market throughout the world. In such an ideal world capital market,

the required return on securities of comparable risk will be the same in all

capital markets after adjusting for taxes and foreign exchange rates. This

situation implies that the cost of funds will be the same regardless of where

in the capital markets throughout the world a funds-seeking entity elects to

raise funds.

Real-world capital markets are neither completely segmented nor

completely integrated but fall somewhere in between. A **mildly segmented**

**market** - r
**mildly integrated market** implies that world capital markets

- ffer opportunities to raise funds at a lower cost outside the local capital
market.

```
Motivation for Raising Funds Outside the Domestic Market

```

A corporation may seek to raise funds outside its domestic market for four

reasons. First, in some countries, large corporations seeking to raise a

substantial amount of funds may have no other choice but to obtain

financing in either the foreign market sector of another country or the

Euromarket, because the fundraising corporation's domestic market is not

sufficiently developed to be able to satisfy the fundraiser's demand for

funds on globally competitive terms. Governments of developing countries

use these markets when seeking funds for government-owned corporations

in the process of privatizing.

The second reason is the opportunity to obtain a reduced cost of funding

(taking into consideration issuing costs) compared to that available in the

domestic market. As we explained in chapter 16, in the case of debt, the

cost will reflect two factors: (1) the risk-free rate, which is accepted as the

interest rate on a U.S. Treasury security with the same maturity or some

- ther low-risk security (called the **base rate** ), and (2) a **spread** to reflect the
greater risks that investors perceive as being associated with the issue or
issuer.

A corporate borrower who seeks reduced funding costs is seeking to

reduce the spread. The integration of capital markets throughout the world

diminishes such opportunities. Nevertheless, imperfections in capital

markets throughout the world prevent complete integration and thereby may

permit a reduced cost of funds. These imperfections, or market frictions,

- ccur because of differences in security regulations in various countries, tax
structures, restrictions imposed on regulated institutional investors, and the
credit risk perception of the issuer. In the case of common stock, a
corporation seeks to gain a higher value for its stock and to reduce the
market impact cost of floating a large offering.

The third reason to seek funds in foreign markets is a desire by corporate

treasurers to diversify their source of funding in order to reduce reliance on

domestic investors. In the case of equities, diversifying funding sources

may encourage foreign investors who have different perspectives on the

future performance of the corporation. Two additional advantages of raising

foreign equity funds, from the perspective of U.S. corporations, are the

following: (1) some market observers believe that certain foreign investors

are more loyal to corporations and look at long-term performance rather

than short-term performance as do investors in the United States, [7] and (2)

diversifying the investor base reduces the dominance of U.S. institutional

holdings and its impact on corporate governance.

The fourth reason is that a corporation may issue a security denominated

in a foreign currency as part of its overall foreign currency management. As

an example, consider a U.S. corporation that plans to build a factory in a

foreign country where the construction costs will be denominated in the

foreign currency. Assume that the corporation plans to sell the output of the

factory in the same foreign country. Therefore, the revenue will be

denominated in the foreign currency. The corporation then faces exchange

rate risk: The construction costs are uncertain in U.S. dollars, because

during the construction period, the U.S. dollar may depreciate relative to the

foreign currency. Also, the projected revenue is uncertain in U.S. dollars,

because the foreign currency may depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar.

Suppose that the corporation arranges debt financing for the plant, in which

it receives the proceeds in the foreign currency and the liabilities are

denominated in the foreign currency. This financing arrangement can

reduce exchange rate risk, because the proceeds received will be in the

foreign currency and will be used to pay the construction costs, and the

projected revenue can be applied to service the debt obligation.

_Corporate Financing Week_ asked the corporate treasurers of several

multinational corporations why they used nondomestic markets to raise

funds. [8] The treasurers' responses reflected one or more of the reasons just

cited. For example, the director of corporate finance of General Motors said

that the company used the Eurobond market with the objective of

"diversifying funding sources, attract[ing] new investors and achiev[ing]

comparable, if not cheaper, financing." A managing director of Sears,

Roebuck stated that the company "has a long-standing policy of

diversifying geographical [funding] sources and instruments to avoid

reliance on any specific market, even if the cost is higher." He stated further

that "Sears cultivates a presence in the international market by issuing every

three years or so."

```
Key Points

```

- The primary market involves the distribution to investors of newly issued
securities and seasoned offerings.

   - Entities seeking to raise funds in every developed country are
required to comply with that country's securities laws.

   - In the United States, there are two principal pieces of federal
legislation regarding securities: the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities
Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).

   - The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the U.S. federal
agency responsible for administrating federal securities laws as set
forth in the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

   - In all countries, securities laws dealing with the primary market
cover three critical issues: (1) how a "security" is defined, (2)
disclosure requirements when securities are issued, and (3) the
solicitation of funds.

   - There are typically two basic objectives of the securities laws in
countries: (1) the disclosure of information about the securities that an

entity is planning to issue and (2) the prevention of the sale of

securities as a result of deceit, misrepresentation, and other fraud.

  - Disclosure information is accomplished by the issuance of a
prospectus that provides "full and fair disclosure of the character of
securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the
mails."

   - Unless an exemption is allowed, an issuer of a new security must file
certain documents with regulators. In the United States, the following
documents must be filed with the SEC: 10-K report; 10-Q report; 8-K
report; proxy statement; Forms 3, 4, and 5; and Schedule 13D and
Schedule 13G reports.

   - In the United States, SEC Rule 415, the shelf registration rule,
permits certain issuers to file a single registration document indicating
that it intends to sell a certain amount of a certain class of securities at

   - ne or more times in the next two years.
   - Variations in the underwriting process include the bought deal for
the underwriting of bonds and seasoned equity offerings, the auction
process, and preemptive rights offering for underwriting common
stock.

   - A private placement is different from the public offering of securities
in terms of the regulatory requirements that must be satisfied by the
issuer. Certain provisions in federal securities law allow issuers to be
exempt from registering a new issue with the SEC.

Questions

```

1. Why must a country's securities law provide guidance as to what a
security is?

2. Why is it critical for the securities law of a country to set forth what
a public offering of securities is?

3. "In the United States, the federal government—not the states—
regulate the issuance of securities." Explain whether you agree or
disagree with this statement.

4. What is the purpose of a prospectus?
5. In the Eurozone, the public offering of securities are carried out
under the European Prospectus Directive and allows an issuer that has
had a prospectus approved in an European Union member state to use
the same prospectus for the securities in any other European Union
member state. What is the rationale for the European Union allowing
this—which is referred to as the "passport" mechanism?

6. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 require that all securities offered to the general public be
registered with the SEC unless granted a specific exemption. The
Securities Act provides for exemptions from federal registration.
Describe some of these exemptions.

7. In an article published in 2009, Donald Langevoort argues that U.S.
securities regulation has historically focused on retail investors rather
than on institutional investors. He goes on to observe that foreign
entities wanting to sell securities in the United States should only be
required to comply with the laws of their home countries, as long as
those laws are "reasonably responsive to institutional investor
interests." [9] Explain why you agree or disagree with this view.

8. In September 2013, Twitter Inc. acquired MoPub (a mobile ad
startup). The acquisition occurred a few days prior to Twitter's
announcement that the company was going public. What document did
Twitter Inc. have to file with the SEC as a result of the acquisition?

contains this information?

10. a. What is meant by a "bought deal"?

b. Why do corporations seeking to raise funds of seasoned common stock

prefer to use a bought deal rather than a firm commitment arrangement?

11. When comparing a bought deal for seasoned equity offerings to a
traditional offering via a firm commitment, the latter is referred to as a
"marketed" offering. Explain why.

12. On July 29, 2010, Panasonic Corporation announced that its board

within one year of the effective date of the Shelf Registration
Statement (i.e., from August 12, 2010 to August 2011) for a planned
amount of issues of up to ¥ 500 billion. The common stock would be
issued via a public offering in Japan, and the proceeds would be used

   - the definition of a secondary market;
   - the need for secondary markets for financial assets;
   - the difference between a continuous and a call market;
   - the requirements of a perfect market;
   - what short selling is and the importance of short selling for pricing
securities in financial markets;

   - frictions that cause actual financial markets to differ from a perfect
market;

   - what is meant by the "pricing efficiency" of a market;
   - the implications of pricing efficiency;
   - the different forms of pricing efficiency; and
   - the implications of pricing efficiency for market participants.

In chapter 1, we described the various functions of financial markets. We

noted in that chapter that financial markets can be divided into primary and

secondary markets. In the secondary market, already issued financial assets

are traded. The key distinction between a primary market (as described in

chapter 1) and a secondary market is that, in the secondary market, the

issuer of the asset does not receive funds from the buyer. Instead, the

existing issue changes hands in the secondary market, and funds flow from

the buyer of the asset to the seller.

In this chapter, we explain the various features of secondary markets.

These features are common to the trading of any type of financial

instrument. We take a closer look at individual markets in later chapters.

```
Function of Secondary Markets

```

It is worthwhile to review once again the function of secondary markets. In

the secondary market, an issuer of securities—whether it is a corporation or

a governmental unit—can obtain regular information about the value of the

asset. The periodic trading of the asset reveals to the issuer the consensus

price that the asset commands in an open market. Thus, firms can discover

what value investors attach to their stocks, and firms or noncorporate

issuers can observe the prices of their bonds and the implied interest rates

investors expect and demand from them. Such information helps issuers

assess how well they are using the funds acquired from earlier primary

market activities, and it also indicates how receptive investors would be to

new offerings.

The other service that a secondary market offers issuers is the

- pportunity for the original buyer of an asset to reverse the investment by
selling it for cash. Unless investors are confident that they can shift from

- ne financial asset to another as they deem necessary, they would naturally
be reluctant to buy any financial asset. Such reluctance would harm
potential issuers in one of two ways: Either issuers would be unable to sell
new securities at all, or they would have to pay a higher rate of return,
because investors would increase the discount rate in compensation for the
expected illiquidity in the securities.

Investors in financial assets receive several benefits from a secondary

market. Such a market obviously offers them liquidity for their assets as

well as information about the assets' fair or consensus values. Furthermore,

secondary markets bring together many interested parties and thereby

reduce the costs of searching for likely buyers and sellers of assets.

Moreover, by accommodating many trades, secondary markets keep the

cost of transactions low. By keeping the costs of both searching and

transacting low, secondary markets encourage investors to purchase

financial assets.

```
Architectural Structure of Secondary Markets

```

Different architectural structures can be used when establishing a secondary

market for a financial asset. [1] The two general architectural structures are

- rder-driven and quote-driven markets. Real-world financial markets use a
blend of these structures for different types of financial assets. To
understand the difference between an order-driven and a quote-driven
market, we must make clear who the potential parties are.

```
Potential Parties to a Trade

```

The potential parties to a trade include (1) natural buyers, (2) natural sellers,

(3) brokers, and (4) dealers. The **natural buyers** and **natural sellers** want

to take a position for their own portfolios. They can be retail investors or

institutional investors.

A **broker** is a third party in a trade that acts on behalf of a buyer or

seller who wishes to execute an order. In economic and legal terms, a

broker is said to be an "agent" of one of the parties to the trade. The

brokerage activity does not require the broker to buy and hold in inventory

- r sell from inventory the financial asset that is the subject of the trade.
Instead the broker receives, transmits, and executes a customer's orders. In
exchange for this service, the broker receives an explicit commission.

A **dealer** is an entity that acts as an intermediary in a trade by buying

and selling for its own account. Basically, a dealer buys a financial asset to

place in its inventory or sells a financial asset from its own inventory. A

dealer is said to "take a position" in an asset. Notice the distinction between

a dealer buying and selling for its own account, which is acting as an

intermediary in a trade, and a natural buyer and natural seller purchasing or

selling for their own accounts. When acting in this capacity, a dealer

commits its own capital to accommodate a trade sought by other parties.

Hence, in contrast to a broker, a dealer acts as a **principal** in a trade. The

potential income earned from this intermediary activity is the difference

between the price at which a dealer is willing to offer a financial asset to

investors (the ask price) and the price at which a dealer is willing to buy a

financial asset from investors (the bid price). The difference is referred to as

the .

**bid-ask spread**

A special type of dealer is called a **market maker** . This term describes a

dealer that has a special obligation in the secondary market. That special

- bligation is to use its capital to make an orderly market for designated
financial assets.

```
Order-Driven Markets and Quote-Driven Markets

```

Now let's explore what is meant by an "order-driven market" and a "quotedriven market." The difference is based on how trading takes place and how

the price is determined. In its purest sense, an **order-driven market** is one

in which all of the participants in the trade are natural buyers and natural

sellers—no dealer is acting as an intermediary. The clearing price is

determined by the flow of buy and sell orders. Another term used to

describe an order-driven market is an **auction market** .

In a **quote-driven market**, rather than the price being determined by the

interaction of natural buyers and natural sellers, it is determined by the

dealer and is based on prevailing market information. The dealer then

stands ready to buy and sell a financial asset at the prices it quotes. Because

- f the role played by the dealer in a quote-driven market, this market
structure is also is also referred to as a **dealer market** - r
**dealership**

**market** .

```
Types of Order-Driven Markets

```

An order-driven market can be further classified as a continuous order

driven market or a periodic call auction.

In a **continuous order-driven market**, prices are determined

continuously throughout the trading day as buyers and sellers submit orders.

For example, given the order flow at 10 a.m., the market-clearing price of a

financial asset may be \$70; at 11 a.m. of the same trading day, the marketclearing price of the same financial asset, but with different order flows,

may be \$70.75. Thus, in a continuous market, prices may vary with the

pattern of orders reaching the market and not because of any change in the

basic situation of supply and demand. We return to this point later in this

chapter.

The other type of order-driven market structure is the **periodic call**

**auction**, in which orders are batched or grouped together for simultaneous

execution at preannounced times. For example, a periodic call auction can

- ccur at the opening of the trading day, at the close of the trading day, or at
designated times during the trading day. The auction may be oral or written.
In either case, the auction will determine or "fix" the market-clearing price
at a particular time of the trading day. This use of the word "fix" is
traditional and is not pejorative or suggestive of illegal activity. The price

- btained for a periodic call auction can be determined through a price scan
auction or a sealed bid auction.

In a **price scan auction**, an auctioneer announces tentative prices and

the participants physically present respond indicating how much they would

be willing to buy and sell at each tentative price. The market-clearing price

is then determined by the price that will balance the buy and sell orders. In

a **sealed bid/ask auction**, the bid price/ask price and the quantities a

participant is willing to transact are submitted. Information about the order

- f a party who participates in the auction is not disclosed to the other
participants involved in the auction. Buy and sell orders are then cumulated
by price: from the highest bid price to the lowest bid price for buyers and
from the lowest ask price to the highest ask price for sellers. The marketclearing price is the price at which the cumulated buy orders equal the
cumulated sell orders.

```
Trading Locations

```

In chapter 22, we describe the different types of trading venues for stocks,

bonds, and derivative instruments. Trading venues can be divided into

exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and off-exchange markets,

which mean trading venues that are not exchanges or OTC. Here we briefly

describe the first two venues.

In all countries, there are secondary markets that are legally established

as national securities exchanges, which we will refer to simply as

**exchanges** . The products traded on an exchange are approved by the

directors of the exchange and are referred to as "listed products." For

example, in the case of common stock, the product is the stock of a

company. However, not all companies' common stock in a country is listed

- n a stock exchange. The stock exchange will specify requirements for a
company to be traded on that exchange. Such a company is said to be a
"listed company." Other products that can be traded on an exchange are
certain types of derivative products, such as options and futures. In fact, as
explained in chapter 33, by definition, a futures contract is an exchangetraded product. Only those who are members of an exchange are permitted
to trade on the exchange. The general public cannot trade on an exchange

and must trade through an exchange member. The rules for trading on an

exchange are set forth by the exchange. Exchanges used to be physical, inperson locations but have evolved to be electronic forums.

The **OTC market** is simply the market where non-exchange-traded

products are traded.

Trading in the OTC market is done by geographically dispersed traders

linked to one another by telecommunications systems. In the case of

common stock, unlisted stocks are traded in the OTC market. Nonexchange-traded derivatives are traded in the OTC market. (We explain

OTC derivatives in chapter 37.) Although some bonds are traded on an

exchange, such trading of bonds is extremely rare. Bonds are a good

example of a product that can be traded on an exchange but for which the

majority of trading is in the OTC market. Foreign exchange (currency) is

primarily traded in the OTC market. Derivatives are traded on both

exchanges and the OTC market.

The architectural structure of an exchange market can be either order

driven or quote driven. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an orderdriven market and is a hybrid continuous order-driven/periodic call auction

market. In contrast, the Nasdaq is an exchange that is a quote-driven market

but has an element of an order-driven market. This is because the opening

- f the Nasdaq is a periodic call auction. [2] All OTC markets are quote-driven
markets.

```
Theoretically Perfect Market Characteristics

```

To explain the ideal characteristics of secondary markets, we first describe a

**perfect market** for a financial asset. Then we can show how common

- ccurrences in real markets keep them from being theoretically perfect.

In general, a perfect market results when the number of buyers and

sellers is sufficiently large, and all participants are small enough relative to

the market so that no individual market agent can influence the

commodity's price. Consequently, all buyers and sellers are price-takers,

and the market price is determined where there is equality of supply and

demand. This condition is more likely to be satisfied if the commodity

traded is fairly homogeneous (for example, corn or wheat). But a market is

not perfect only because market agents are price-takers. A perfect market is

also free of transactions costs and any impediment to the interaction of

supply and demand for the commodity. Economists refer to these various

costs and impediments as **frictions** . The costs associated with frictions

generally result in buyers paying more (or sellers receiving less) than in the

absence of frictions.

In the case of financial markets, frictions include:

   - commissions charged by brokers;
   - bid-ask spreads charged by dealers;
   - order handling and clearance charges;
   - taxes (notably on capital gains) and government-imposed transfer
fees;

   - costs of acquiring information about the financial asset;
   - trading restrictions, such as exchange-imposed restrictions on the
size of a position in the financial asset that a buyer or seller may take;

   - restrictions on market makers; and
  - halts to trading that may be imposed by regulators where the
financial asset is traded.

```
Short Selling and Its Importance in Financial Markets

```

An investor who expects the price of a security to increase can benefit from

buying that security. However, suppose that an investor expects the price of

a security to decline and wants to benefit if the price actually does decline.

What can the investor do? The investor may be able to sell the security

without owning it. Various institutional arrangements allow an investor to

borrow securities so that the borrowed security can be delivered to satisfy

the sale.

This practice of selling securities that are not owned at the time of sale is

referred to as **selling short** . The security is purchased subsequently by the

investor and returned to the party that lent it. When the security is returned,

the investor is said to have "covered the short position." A profit will be

realized if the purchase price is less than the price at which the investor sold

short the security.

The ability of investors to sell short is an important mechanism in

financial markets. In the absence of an effective short-selling mechanism,

security prices will tend to be biased toward the view of more optimistic

investors, causing a market to depart from the standards of a perfect pricesetting situation. In fact, many large and developed securities markets allow

short selling, although regulatory bodies tend to monitor this practice more

closely than other features of markets. Nonetheless, the prevalence of short

selling is clear evidence of its usefulness to the price-setting function of

securities markets.

Below we first explain the importance of a having a mechanism for

selling short to the functioning of financial markets and then describe the

mechanics of short selling.

**`Theoretical and empirical rationales for short selling`** Let's first
look at the theoretical arguments in favor of short selling. When restrictions
are imposed on short selling a security, the price of that security is then set
by the most optimistic investors. There are limited trading opportunities for
investors who are less optimistic about the issuer's future prospects, which
impacts the security's future price. For those investors who are less

- ptimistic about the security's price, in the absence of (or restrictions on)
short selling, they would have to sell their holdings. The result is potential

- verpricing of some securities. The opportunity to short sell such
- verpriced securities is exploitable only when the overpricing is due to
factors that are likely to be revealed in the relatively near future.

Edward Miller builds on this principle by arguing that a substantial

divergence of investor opinion about a stock implies a negative expected

return. [3] This is because restrictions on short selling prevent unfavorable

- pinions from being fully reflected in stock prices. Therefore, with
restricted short selling, divergence of opinion tends to raise prices, and
profits can be improved by avoiding securities with a high divergence of

- pinion, especially those that analysts disagree about. Miller further
demonstrates that because risk correlates with divergence of opinion, the
return to risk is less than what investors would otherwise require. This

reasoning led Miller to suggest that typical investors should overweight the

less risky stocks in their portfolio.

The description of the short selling of common stock in chapter 23

shows that in real-world markets, constraints are imposed on investors who

want to sell short. These constraints include transaction costs and the legal

and institutional constraints. When such constraints are imposed on certain

securities, these securities can be overpriced and thus have low future

returns until the overpricing is corrected. Focusing on stocks, Lamont and

Jones provide empirical evidence of such overpricing by showing that

stocks with high short-sale constraints tend to experience particularly low

returns in the future. [4] They also present specific cases where extremely high

short-sale constraints led to extremely high prices.

**`Mechanics of short selling`** To illustrate short selling with an example,
suppose Ms. Stokes believes that Wilson Pharmaceuticals common stock is

- verpriced at \$20 per share and wants to be in a position to benefit if her
assessment is correct. Ms. Stokes calls her broker, Mr. Yats, indicating that
she wants to sell 100 shares of Wilson Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Yats will do

two things: sell 100 shares of Wilson Pharmaceuticals on behalf of Ms.

Stokes, and arrange to borrow 100 shares of that stock. Suppose that Mr.

Yats is able to sell the stock for \$20 per share and arrange to borrow the

stock from Mr. Jordan. The shares borrowed from Mr. Jordan will be

delivered to the buyer of the 100 shares. The proceeds from the sale

(ignoring commissions) will be \$2,000. However, the proceeds will not be

given to Ms. Stokes, because she has not given her broker the 100 shares.

Now, suppose that one week later, the price of Wilson Pharmaceuticals

stock declines to \$15 per share. Ms. Stokes may instruct her broker to _buy_

100 shares of Wilson Pharmaceuticals. The cost of buying the shares (once

again ignoring commissions) is \$1,500.The shares purchased are then

delivered to Mr. Jordan, who loaned the original 100 shares to Ms. Stokes.

At this point, Ms. Stokes has sold 100 shares and bought 100 shares, so she

no longer has any obligation to her broker or to Mr. Jordan—she has

"covered her short position". She is entitled to the funds in her account that

were generated by the selling and buying activity. She sold the stock for

\$2,000 and bought it for \$1,500. Thus, she realizes a profit of \$500 before

commissions and fees. The broker’s commission and a fee charged by the

lender of the stock are then subtracted from the \$500. Furthermore, if any

dividends were paid by Wilson Pharmaceuticals while the stock was

borrowed, Ms. Stokes must return them to Mr. Jordan, who still owned the

stock at the time.

Instead of falling, suppose that the price of Wilson Pharmaceuticals

stock rises. Ms. Stokes will realize a loss when she is forced to cover her

short position. For example, if the price rises to \$27 per share, Ms. Stokes

will lose \$700, to which must be added commissions and the cost of

borrowing the stock.

Note the downside risk for a short seller versus a long buyer. When an

investor purchases a stock (i.e., takes a long position), the most that the

investor can lose is the purchase price. In contrast, when an investor sells

short a stock, the maximum amount of the loss can be significant and not

known at the time the stock is sold short. For example, in our illustration, if

the price of Wilson Pharmaceutical increases to \$50 per share, then loss

would be \$3,000. A price increase to \$100 would result in a loss of \$8,000.

This is the reason that short selling is a very risky transaction.

```
Role of Brokers and Dealers in Real Markets

```

Common occurrences in real markets keep them from meeting the

theoretical standards of being perfect. Because of these occurrences,

brokers and dealers are necessary to the smooth functioning of a secondary

market.

```
Brokers

```

One way in which a real market might not meet all the exacting standards

- f a theoretically perfect market is that many investors may not be present
at all times in the marketplace.

Furthermore, a typical investor may not be skilled in the art of the deal

- r completely informed about every facet of trading in the asset. Clearly,
even in smoothly functioning markets, most investors need professional
assistance. Investors need someone to receive and keep track of their orders

for buying or selling, to find other parties wishing to sell or buy, to

negotiate for good prices, to serve as a focal point for trading, and to

execute the orders. The broker performs all these functions. Obviously,

these functions are more important for complicated trades, such as for

exceptionally small or large trades, than for simple transactions or those of

typical size.

A broker is an entity that acts on behalf of an investor who wishes to

execute orders rather than trading for his or her own account. That is, the

risks associated with the transaction (long or short) belong to the client (i.e.,

the investor), not the broker. These functions are performed by brokers or

agents of the investor. It is important to realize that the brokerage activity

does not require the broker to buy and sell or hold in inventory the financial

asset that is the subject of the trade. (Such activity is termed "taking a

position" in the asset, and it is the role of the dealer, another important

financial market participant discussed in the following text.) Instead, the

broker receives, transmits, and executes investors' orders with other

investors. The broker receives an explicit commission for these services,

and the commission is a transactions cost of the securities markets. If the

broker also provides other services, such as research, recordkeeping, or

advising, investors may pay additional charges.

```
Dealers as Market Makers

```

A real market might also differ from the perfect market because of the

possibly frequent event of a temporary imbalance in the number of buy and

sell orders that investors may place for any security at any given time. Such

unmatched or unbalanced flow causes two problems. One is that the

security's price may change abruptly, even if there has been no shift in

either supply or demand for the security. Another problem is that buyers

may have to pay higher than market-clearing prices (or sellers accept lower

- nes) if they want to make their trades immediately.

An example can illustrate these points. Suppose that the consensus price

for ABC security is \$50, which was determined in several recent trades.

Now suppose that a flow of buy orders from investors who suddenly have

cash arrives in the market, but there is no accompanying supply of sell

- rders. This temporary imbalance could be sufficient to push the price of
ABC security to, say, \$55. Thus, the price has changed sharply, even though
nothing has changed in any fundamental financial aspect of the issuer.
Buyers who want to buy immediately must pay \$55 rather than \$50, and
this difference can be viewed as the price of **immediacy** . By "immediacy,"
we mean that buyers and sellers do not want to wait for the arrival of
sufficient orders on the other side of the trade, which would bring the price
closer to the level of recent transactions.

As explained earlier, the existence of imbalances explains the need for

the dealer or market maker, who stands ready and willing to buy a financial

asset for its own account (to add to an inventory of the financial asset) or

sell from its own account (to reduce the inventory of the financial asset). At

a given time, dealers are willing to buy a financial asset at a price (the bid

price) that is less than what they are willing to sell the same financial asset

for (the ask price). In the 1960s, two economists, George Stigler [5] and

Harold Demsetz, [6] analyzed the role of dealers in securities markets. They

viewed dealers as the suppliers of immediacy—the ability to trade promptly

- to the market. The bid-ask spread can be viewed in turn as the price
charged by dealers for supplying immediacy together with short-run price
stability (continuity or smoothness) in the presence of short-term order
imbalances. Dealers play two other roles: providing reliable price
information to market participants, and, in certain market structures,
providing the services of an auctioneer in bringing order and fairness to a
market. [7]

The price stabilization role follows from our earlier example of what

may happen to the price of a particular transaction in the absence of any

intervention when there is a temporary imbalance of orders. By taking the

- pposite side of a trade when there are no other orders, the dealer prevents
the price from materially diverging from the price at which a recent trade
was consummated.

Investors are concerned not only with immediacy but also with being

able to trade at prices that are reasonable, given prevailing conditions in the

market. Although dealers do not know with certainty the true price of a

security, they do have a privileged position in some market structures with

respect not only to the flow of market orders but also to **limit orders**, which

are special orders that can be executed only if the market price of the asset

changes in a specified way. (See chapter 23 for more on limit orders.) For

example, the dealers of the organized markets, called **specialists** and

discussed in chapter 22, have just such a privileged position, from which

they get special information about the flow of market orders.

Finally, the dealer acts as an **auctioneer** in some market structures,

thereby providing order and fairness in the operations of the market. For

example, as explained in chapter 22, the market maker on organized stock

exchanges in the United States performs this function by organizing trading

to make sure that the exchange rules for the priority of trading are followed.

The role of a market maker in a call market structure is that of an

auctioneer. The market maker does not take a position in the traded asset, as

a dealer does in a continuous market.

What factors determine the price that dealers should charge for the

services they provide? Or equivalently, what factors determine the bid-ask

spread? One of the most important is the order processing costs incurred by

dealers. The costs of equipment necessary to do business and a dealer's

administrative and operations staff are examples. The lower these costs are,

the narrower the bid-ask spread will be. With the reduced cost of computing

and better-trained personnel, these costs have declined since the 1960s.

Dealers also have to be compensated for bearing risk. A **dealer's**

**position** may involve carrying inventory of a security (a **long position** ) or

selling a security that is not in inventory (a **short position** ). In markets

where shorting is common, positions are often referred to as "long only" or

"short only." Three types of risks are associated with maintaining a long or

short position in a given security. First, there is the uncertainty about the

future price of the security. A dealer who has a net long position in the

security is concerned that the price will decline in the future; a dealer who

is in a net short position is concerned that the price will rise. In short,

dealers trade for their own account, while brokers trade for someone else's

account, their customer.

The second type of risk has to do with the expected time it will take the

dealer to unwind a position and its uncertainty. And this, in turn, depends

primarily on the number of buyers and sellers in the market for the security.

In a thin market, there is a low number of buyers and sellers seeking

transactions in the security, while in thick market there is a large number of

buyers and sellers. Finally, even though a dealer may have access to better

information about order flows than the general public does, there are some

trades where the dealer takes the risk of trading with someone who has

better information. [8] This results in the better-informed trader obtaining a

better price at the expense of the dealer. Consequently, when establishing

the bid-ask spread for a trade, a dealer will assess whether the trader might

have better information. [9]

```
Market Efficiency

```

The term "efficient capital market" has been used in several contexts to

describe the operating characteristics of a capital market. There is a

distinction, however, between an **operationally** (or **internally** ) **efficient**

**market** and a **pricing** (or **externally** ) **efficient capital market** . [10]

```
Operational Efficiency

```

In an **operationally efficient market**, investors can obtain transaction

services as cheaply as possible, given the costs associated with furnishing

those services. The cost of transacting is critical to investors and

professional asset managers. Moreover, the SEC has continued to amend

the Securities Exchange Act so that investors can obtain the best execution

possible. Below we provide a brief explanation of trading costs. [11]

Transaction costs are more than merely brokerage commissions—they

consist of commissions, fees, execution costs, and opportunity costs.

Commissions are the fees paid to brokers to execute orders, and the

commission is negotiable between the investor and the broker. Other types

- f fees include custodial fees and transfer fees. Custodial fees are the those

charged by the financial entity that holds securities in safekeeping for an

investor.

Beyond fees, there are hidden costs of trading. **Execution costs**

represent the difference between the execution price of a security and the

price that would have existed in the absence of the trade. Execution costs

can be further decomposed into market (or price) impact and market timing

costs. **Market impact cost** (or simply **impact cost** ) is the result of the bidask spread and a price concession extracted by dealers to mitigate their risk

that an investor's demand for liquidity is information motivated. (By a

"price concession," we mean the investor will have to pay a higher price

when buying and a lower price when selling.) **Market timing cost** arises

when an adverse price movement of the security during the time of the

transaction can be attributed in part to other activity in the security and is

not the result of a particular transaction. Execution costs, then, are related to

both the demand for liquidity and the trading activity on the trade date.

A distinction can be made between **information-motivated trades** and

**informationless trades** . [12] Information-motivated trading occurs when
investors believe they possess pertinent information not currently reflected
in the security's price. This style of trading tends to increase market impact,
because it emphasizes the speed of execution, or because the market maker
believes a desired trade is driven by information and increases the bid-ask
spread to provide some protection. It can involve the sale of one security in
favor of another. Informationless trades result from either a reallocation of

wealth or the implementation of an investing strategy that depends only on

existing public information. An example of the former is a pension fund's

decision to invest cash in the stock market. Other examples of

informationless trades include portfolio rebalancing, the investment of new

money, or liquidations. In these circumstances, the demand for liquidity

alone should not lead the market maker to demand the significant price

concessions associated with new information.

The problem with measuring execution costs is that the true measure—

which is the difference between the price of the security in the absence of

the investor's trade and the execution price—is not observable.

Furthermore, the execution prices depend on supply and demand conditions

at the margin. Thus, the execution price may be influenced by competitive

traders who demand immediate execution or on other investors with similar

motives for trading. Then the execution price realized by an investor is the

consequence of the structure of the market mechanism, the demand for

liquidity by the marginal investor, and the competitive forces of investors

with similar motivations for trading.

The cost of not transacting represents an **opportunity cost** . [13]

Opportunity costs may arise when a desired trade fails to be executed. This

component of costs represents the difference in performance between an

investor's desired investment and the same investor's actual investment

after adjusting for execution costs, commissions, and fees.

Opportunity costs are characterized as the hidden cost of trading. Some

analysts suggest that the shortfall in performance of many actively managed

portfolios is the consequence of failing to execute all desired trades. [14]

Measurement of opportunity costs is subject to the same problems as

measurement of execution costs. The true measure of opportunity costs

depends on knowing the resulting performance of a security if all desired

trades were executed at the desired time across an investment horizon.

Because these desired trades were not executed, the benchmark is

inherently unobservable.

```
Pricing Efficiency

```

**Pricing efficiency** refers to a market where prices at all times fully reflect
all available information that is relevant to the valuation of securities. That

is, relevant information about the security is quickly integrated into the

price of securities.

In his seminal review article on pricing efficiency, Eugene Fama pointed

- ut that to test whether a market is price-efficient, two definitions are
necessary. First, it is necessary to define what it means that prices "fully
reflect" information. Second, the "relevant" set of information that is
assumed to be "fully reflected" in prices must be defined. [15] Fama, as well as

- thers, defines "fully reflects" in terms of the expected return from holding
a security. The expected return over some holding period is equal to
expected cash distributions plus the expected price change, all divided by
the initial price. The price formation process defined by Fama and others is
that the expected return one period from now is a random variable that
already takes into account the "relevant" information set.

When defining the "relevant" information set that prices should reflect,

Fama classified the pricing efficiency of a market into three forms: weak,

semi-strong, and strong. The distinction between these forms lies in the

relevant information that is hypothesized in the price of the security. **Weak**

**efficiency** means that the price of the security reflects the past price and

trading history of the security. **Semi-strong efficiency** means that the price

- f the security fully reflects all public information, which includes but is not
limited to historical price and trading patterns. **Strong efficiency** exists in a
market where the price of a security reflects all information, regardless of
whether it is publicly available.

A price-efficient market carries certain implications for the investment

strategy that investors wish to pursue. Throughout this book, we refer to

various active strategies employed by investors. In an active strategy,

investors seek to capitalize on what they perceive to be the mispricing of a

security or securities. In a market that is price efficient, active strategies will

not consistently generate an abnormal return after taking into consideration

transaction costs and the risks associated with a strategy that is actively

managed rather than simply buying and holding securities. In certain

markets that empirical evidence suggests are price efficient, investors may

pursue a strategy of **indexing**, which simply seeks to match the

performance of some financial index. We look at the pricing efficiency of

the stock market in chapter 23.

```
Electronic Trading

```

Traditionally, securities trading has historically occurred mainly in person

(e.g., on stock exchange trading floors) or via the telephone (typically in the

bond market, as explained in chapter 26). Currently, however, securities

buyers and seller are mainly brought together electronically (that is, through

electronic trading platforms), which is referred to as **etrading**, Electronic

trading provides virtual trading platforms. Often systems for clearing and

settlement of trades are integrated in trading systems. This is referred to as

**straight-through processing** . There are many types of equity and bond

electronic trading systems.

```
Key Points

```

- A secondary market in financial assets is one where existing or
- utstanding assets are traded among investors.
  - A secondary market serves several needs of the firm or
governmental unit that issues securities in the primary market.

   - The secondary market provides the issuer with regular information
about the value of its outstanding stocks or bonds, and it encourages
investors to buy securities from issuers, because it offers them an

   - ngoing opportunity for liquidating their investments in securities.
  - Investors get services from the secondary market, because the
market supplies them with liquidity and prices for the assets they are
holding or want to buy, and the market brings interested investors
together, thereby reducing the costs of searching for other parties and

   - f making trades.
   - In general, secondary market structures can be classified as order
driven or quote driven, with real-world financial markets using a
combination of these market structures.

   - Quote-driven markets do not require a dealer, and the prices are
determined by the interaction of natural buyers and natural sellers
rather than being set by a dealer.

   - Order-driven markets can be further classified as continuous order
driven and periodic call auction markets.

   - Markets are classified as exchange markets and over-the-counter
(OTC) markets.

  - Secondary markets may be continuous or call markets or a
combination of the two.

  - In a continuous market, trading and price determination go on
throughout the day as orders to buy and sell reach the market.

   - In a call market, prices are determined by executions of batched or
grouped orders to buy and sell at a specific time (or times) in the
trading day.

   - A market can be perfect, in a theoretical sense, only if it meets many
conditions regarding number of participants, flow of information,
freedom from regulation, and freedom from costs that hinder trading.

- An investor who expects that the price of a security to decline can
benefit by selling that security short.

- A mechanism to allow investors to sell short is critical in financial

markets, because in the absence of such a mechanism, security prices

will tend to be biased toward the view of more optimistic investors.

- Even the most developed and smoothly functioning secondary
market falls short of being perfect in the economically theoretical
meaning of the term.

- Actual markets tend to have numerous frictions that affect prices and
investors' behavior.

- Some key frictions are transactions costs, which include
commissions, fees, and execution costs.

- Because of imperfections in actual markets, investors need the
services of two types of market participants: dealers and brokers.

- Brokers assist investors by collecting and transmitting orders to the
market, bringing willing buyers and sellers together, negotiating
prices, and executing orders; the fee for these services is the broker's
commission.

- Dealers perform three functions in markets: (1) they provide the
- pportunity for investors to trade immediately rather than waiting for
the arrival of sufficient orders on the other side of the trade

(immediacy), and they do this while maintaining short-run price

stability (continuity); (2) they offer price information to market

participants; and (3) in certain market structures, dealers serve as

auctioneers by bringing order and fairness to a market.

- Dealers buy for their own account and maintain inventories of
assets, and their profits come from selling assets at higher prices than
the prices at which they purchased them.

- A market is operationally efficient if it offers investors reasonably
priced services related to buying and selling.

- Execution costs represent the difference between the execution price
- f a security and the price that would have existed in the absence of
the trade; these costs arise out of the demand for immediate execution

through both the demand for liquidity and the trading activity on the

trade date.

   - Opportunity costs arise when a desired trade fails to be executed.
   - A market is price efficient if at all times prices fully reflect all
available information that is relevant to the valuation of securities.

  - Three forms of pricing efficiency are based on the relevant
information set: weak form, semi-strong form, and strong form.

   - In a price-efficient market, active strategies pursued will not
consistently produce superior returns after adjusting for risk and
transactions costs.

   - Electronic trading (or etrading) brings buyers and sellers together
electronically, replacing personal and telephone contact in most
markets.

   - what is meant by a foreign exchange rate;
   - the different ways that a foreign exchange rate can be quoted (direct
versus indirect);

   - the conventions for quoting foreign exchange rates;
   - what the fundamental determinant of exchange rates is: purchasing
power parity;

   - the role of governments in the foreign exchange market;
   - the role of dealers in the foreign exchange market;
   - the nondealer private participants in the market: importers and
exporters (nonfinancial transactions) and financial institutions (financial
transactions);

   - the dominant role of financing transactions in the foreign exchange
market; and

   - what foreign exchange risk is.

The fundamental fact of international finance is that different countries issue

different currencies, and the relative values of those currencies may change

quickly, substantially, and without warning. Moreover, the change may

either reflect economic developments or be a response to political events that

make no economic sense. As a result, the risk that a currency's value may

change adversely, which is called **foreign exchange risk** - r **currency risk**,

is an important consideration for all participants in the international financial

markets. Investors who purchase securities denominated in a currency

different from their own must worry about the rate of return on those

securities after adjusting for changes in the exchange rate. Firms that issue

- bligations denominated in a foreign currency face the risk of the uncertain
value of the cash payments they owe to investors.

In this chapter, we provide a review of foreign exchange rates and the

foreign exchange rate market. The foreign exchange rate market includes the

cash market (or spot market) and the derivatives market. The cash market or

spot market is the market for settlement of a foreign exchange transaction

within two business days. The derivatives market includes currency futures

and forward contracts, currency options, and currency swaps. All these

derivatives are described in chapter 38.

```
Foreign Exchange Rates

```

An **exchange rate** is defined as the amount of one currency that can be

exchanged for a unit of another currency. In fact, the foreign exchange (FX)

rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency. And,

depending on circumstances, one could define either currency as the price

for the other. So FX rates can be quoted "in either direction." For example,

the FX rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro could be quoted in one of

two ways:

1. The number of U.S. dollars necessary to acquire one euro; this is the
dollar price of one euro.

2. The number of euros necessary to acquire one U.S. dollar; this is the
euro price of one dollar.

```
FX Rate Quotation Conventions

```

FX rate quotations can be either direct or indirect. The difference lies in

identifying one currency as a local currency and the other as a foreign

currency. For example, from the perspective of a U.S. participant, the local

currency would be U.S. dollars, and any other currency, such as the Swiss

franc, would be the foreign currency. From the perspective of a Swiss

participant, the local currency would be the Swiss franc, and other

currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, would be the foreign currency. A **direct**

**quotation** is the number of units of a local currency exchangeable for one

unit of a foreign currency.

An **indirect quotation** is the number of units of a foreign currency that

can be exchanged for one unit of the local currency. Looking at it from a

U.S. participant's perspective, we see that a quotation indicating the number

- f dollars exchangeable for one unit of a foreign currency is a direct
quotation. An indirect quotation from the same participant's perspective
would be the number of units of the foreign currency that can be exchanged
for one U.S. dollar. Obviously, from the point of view of a non-U.S.
participant, the number of U.S. dollars exchangeable for one unit of a non

U.S. currency is an indirect quotation; the number of units of a non-U.S.

currency exchangeable for a U.S. dollar is a direct quotation.

Given a direct quotation, we can obtain an indirect quotation (which is

simply the reciprocal of the direct quotation) and vice versa. For example, on

October 25, 2013, a U.S. investor received a direct quotation of 1.3805 U.S.

dollars for one euro. That is, the price of a euro was \$1.3805. The reciprocal

- f the direct quotation is 0.7244, which would have been the indirect
quotation for the U.S. investor; that is, one U.S. dollar could be exchanged
for \$0.7244 euros, which was the euro price of a U.S. dollar.

If the number of units of a foreign currency that can be obtained for one

dollar—the price of a dollar in that currency, or the indirect quotation—rises,

the dollar is said to appreciate relative to the currency, and the currency is

said to depreciate. Thus, appreciation means a decline in the direct quotation.

Although quotations can be either direct or indirect, the problem is

defining from whose perspective the quotation is given. FX conventions in

fact standardize the ways quotations are given. Because of the importance of

the U.S. dollar in the international financial system, currency quotations are

all relative to the U.S. dollar. When dealers quote, they either give U.S.

dollars per unit of foreign currency (a direct quotation from the U.S.

perspective) or the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar

(an indirect quotation from the U.S. perspective). Quoting in terms of U.S.

dollars per unit of foreign currency is called **American terms**, whereas

quoting in terms of the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S.

dollar is called **European terms** . The dealer convention is to use European

terms when quoting FX, with a few exceptions. The British pound, the Irish

pound, the Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar are exceptions that

are quoted in American terms.

```
International Organization for Standardization Currency Code

```

Currencies are typically identified by reference to their ISO 4217 currency

code, as established by the International Organization for Standardization

(ISO). The code consists of two parts. The first two characters of the

currency code are the country's two-character Internet country code. The

third character is the currency unit. The currency code for selected countries

is shown in table 19.1. For example, the Internet country codes for the

United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Great Britain) are US, JP,

and GB, respectively, and the currency unit for each is the dollar (D), yen

(Y), and pound (P), respectively. Hence the ISO 4217 currency codes for

these three countries are USD, JPY, and GBP, respectively. The ISO 4217

currency code for members of the Eurozone is EUR.

```
FX Rate Determination

```

Since the early 1970s, exchange rates among major currencies have been

free to float, with market forces determining the relative value of a currency.

Thus, each day a currency's price relative to that of another freely floating

currency may stay the same, increase, or decrease.

A key factor affecting the expectation of changes in a country's exchange

rate with another currency is the relative expected inflation rate of the two

countries. Spot exchange rates adjust to compensate for the relative inflation

rate. This adjustment reflects the so-called **purchasing power parity**

relationship, which posits that the exchange rate—the domestic price of the

foreign currency—is proportional to the domestic inflation rate and inversely

proportional to foreign inflation.

Let's look at what happens when the spot exchange rate changes between

two currencies. Suppose that on day 1, the spot exchange rate between the

U.S. dollar and country X's currency is \$0.7966, and on the next day (day 2),

it changes to \$0.8011. Consequently, on day 1, one currency unit of country

X costs \$0.7966. On day 2, it costs more U.S. dollars (\$0.8011) to buy one

currency unit of country X. Thus, the currency unit of country X _appreciated_

relative to the U.S. dollar from day 1 to day 2, or, what amounts to the same

thing, the U.S. dollar _depreciated_ relative to the currency of country X from

day 1 to day 2. Suppose further that on day 3, the spot exchange rate for one

currency unit of country X is \$0.8000. Relative to day 2, the U.S. dollar

appreciated relative to the currency of country X, or, equivalently, the

currency of country X depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar.

```
Cross Rates

```

Barring any government restrictions, riskless arbitrage will ensure that the

exchange rate between two countries will be the same in both countries. The

theoretical exchange rate between two countries other than the United States

can be inferred from their exchange rates with the U.S. dollar. Rates

computed in this way are referred to as **theoretical cross rates** . They would

be computed as follows for two countries, X and Y:

To illustrate, let's calculate the theoretical cross rate between Japanese

yen and British pound on August 11, 2018. The spot exchange rate for the

two currencies in American terms was \$1.27691 per British pound and

0.00902 per Japanese yen. Then the number of units of yen (currency Y) per

unit of British points (currency X) is

That is, it would take 141.5643 yen to obtain one British pound. Taking the

reciprocal gives the number of British pounds exchangeable for one

Japanese yen. In our example, it is 0.0071.

In the real world, it is rare that the theoretical cross rate, as computed

from actual dealer dollar exchange rate quotations, will differ from the actual

cross rate quoted by dealers. When the discrepancy is large compared to the

transaction costs of buying and selling the currencies, a riskless arbitrage

- pportunity arises. Arbitraging to take advantage of cross-rate mispricing is
called **triangular arbitrage**, so named because it involves positions in three
currencies—the U.S. dollar and the two foreign currencies. The arbitrage
keeps actual cross rates in line with theoretical cross rates.

```
FX Turnover

```

Trading volume (or market turnover) statistics for the FX market is reported

every three years by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in its

_Triennial Survey on Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives_ . The 2016

survey found that the average daily market turnover in the FX market (spot

and derivatives) as of April 2016 was US\$5.067 trillion. Of that amount,

spot market trading was \$1.652 trillion per day or 33% of all trading. The

balance, \$3.415 trillion or 67%, was therefore turnover attributable to FX

derivative instruments.

Table 19.2 shows the currency distribution of global FX market turnover

as reported in the 2016 survey for the top eight currencies. The dominate

role of the U.S. dollar can be seen by its significant share.

```
Market Participants in the FX Market

```

The FX market is an OTC market that operates 24 hours a day. Market

participants in the FX market include the central banks of governments,

dealers, nondealer private market entities, and clearinghouses for FX trading.

```
Central Banks of Governments

```

Although major currencies are allowed to float, in practice, national

monetary authorities can intervene in the foreign market for their currency

for a variety of economic reasons. Consequently, the current FX system is

sometimes referred to as a "managed" floating-rate system.

In the United States, currency-related activities are the responsibility of

the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Treasury. This is because the

primary responsibility for international financial policy was delegated by the

U.S. Congress to the U.S. Treasury. However, it is the Federal Reserve Bank

- f New York (FRBNY) that actually carries out those activities when
managing U.S. foreign current reserves. The FRBNY intervenes periodically
after monitoring and analyzes market developments throughout the world.

In 1978, the FRBNY formed the Foreign Exchange Committee (FXC).

Individuals from financial institutions that are actively involved in the FX

markets in global financial markets are members of the FXC. The three

- bjectives that the FXC seeks to accomplish are (1) serving as a working
group to discuss best practices and technical issues in the FX market, (2)
providing recommendations and guidelines that can be used for risk
management in the FX market, and (3) supporting activities that reduce
counterparty risk in FX transactions. This last objective involves
clearinghouses for the settlement of transactions described later in this
section.

Other countries have entities that play the same role as the FXC. For

example, in 1973, the United Kingdom formed The London Foreign

Exchange Joint Standing Committee, which is chaired and administered by

the Bank of England.

```
Dealers

```

Because the FX market is an OTC market that operates 24 hours a day,

market participants who want to buy or sell a currency must search among

different dealers to get the best exchange rate on a specific currency.

Alternatively, market participants who want to transact can refer to various

widely available bank/broker screens, such as Bloomberg Financial Markets

and Reuters. The prices cited on those screens are for indicative pricing only

(i.e., a quote which is neither a firm bid nor a binding bid).

FX dealers do not quote one price. Instead, they quote an exchange rate at

which they are willing to buy a foreign currency (bid) and one at which they

are willing to sell a foreign currency (offer or ask). For example, on

September 4, 2017, the following was the bid and offer reported by Reuters

for one euro in terms of the U.S. dollar: 1.1883 bid and 1.1884 offer. What

this means is that one could exchange one euro for 1.1883 U.S. dollars or

pay 1.1884 U.S. dollars to purchase one euro. The bid-offer spread is 0.0001

in terms of euros.

FX dealers are large international banks and other financial institutions

that specialize in making markets in FX. Commercial banks dominate the

market. There is no organized exchange where foreign currency is traded,

but dealers are linked by telephone and cable and by various information

transfer services. Consequently, the FX market can best be described as an

interbank OTC market. Most transactions between banks are done through

FX brokers. Brokers are agents that do not take a position in the foreign

currencies involved in the transaction. The normal size of a transaction is \$1

million or more.

FX dealers realize revenue from one or more sources: (1) the bid-ask

spread (bid-offer), (2) commissions charged on FX transactions, and (3)

trading profits (appreciation of the currencies that dealers hold a long

position in, depreciation of the currencies that they hold a long position in,

- r appreciation of the currencies that they have a short position in).

The geographical distribution of FX trading by dealers has been

concentrated in the global financial centers in the five countries responsible

for 75% of market activity, according to the Triennial Central Bank Surveys.

As of 2016, by far the dominant financial center is in the United Kingdom

with a share of 36.9%, followed by the United States (19.5%), Singapore

(7.9%), Hong Kong (16.7%), and Japan (6.1%). [1]

```
Nondealer Private Entities

```

FX dealers in the FX market are acting on behalf of clients for their own

accounts. It is the clients who drive the supply and demand for a country's

FX. So let's look closely at who these clients are.

Clients can be divided into two categories. The first category includes

any entity that imports or exports goods and services and seeks FX to

execute the associated transactions. Importers and exporters include

businesses and individuals. Importers need the FX of the country from which

the products are received. Exporters need to exchange the seller's currency

into the domestic currency. Individuals also need a foreign currency when

they travel to other countries. The supply and demand for FX by importers

and exporters prior to the 1970s were the dominant factors impacting FX

rates.

After the 1970s, by far the dominant factor in the determination of FX

rates has been financial transactions by institutional investors. [2] Although it is

macroeconomic fundamental factors that are the major influence on FX

rates, typically, short-term FX rate fluctuations reflect the impact of financial

transactions. When a country's FX rate increases (falls) in the short run, it is

- ften due to the belief by investors buying (selling) financial assets
denominated in that country's currency expecting a further increase
(decrease) in the FX rate.

Appreciation of the U.S. dollar may reflect investors in other countries

seeking a safe haven for their investments, which results in non-U.S.

investors purchasing the U.S. dollar. A recent example was in the second

quarter of 2016, where in general the U.S. dollar had been appreciating

relative to other major currencies. Safe haven investing in the United States

that quarter resulted from international developments, specifically, the June

23 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership in the European

Union. This investing resulted in appreciation of the U.S. dollar.

The shift from nonfinancial participants seeking currency for imports and

exports can be seen from the 2016 Triennial Central Bank Survey, which

reports currency trading with counterparties. As noted earlier, daily annual

turnover as of April 2016 was US\$5.067 trillion. Of that amount, about 39%

was with reporting dealers, 52% was with other financial institutions, and

- nly 9% was with nonfinancial customers (i.e., exporters and importers). [3]

```
Settlement in FX Markets

```

A risk in transactions is the failure of the counterparty to fulfill its

commitment. This risk is reduced by the presence of a reliable settlement

system. In the case of financial instruments and FX, there are such systems

used by banks.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications is a

cooperative society that is a communications network for international

financial market transactions that link financial institutions throughout the

world. Owned by a group of banks in North America and Europe, the

Society allows the member banks nearly instantaneously to transact via

messages among themselves international payments and - ther

communications regarding banking transactions. The speed - f

communications is important because it allows counterparties to respond

instantaneously and settle transactions using one of the electronic clearing

houses discussed below.

The major clearinghouses include Clearing House Interbank Payment

System (CHIPS) and Clearing House Automated Payment System

(CHAPS). CHIPS is owned by the 12 commercial banks constituting the

New York Clearing House Association. Started in 1971, CHIPS is the

world's largest electronic payment system (including FX transactions) for

settlement among banks in New York; that is, there is no need for physical

exchange of checks or funds to settle transactions. The funds are then

transferred via the Fedwire, a communication network linking more than

7,000 banks to the Federal Reserve Banks. Similar to CHIPS, CHAPS is a

mechanism for clearing in London.

```
FX Risk and Derivative Instruments

```

Our major focus in this chapter has been on one sector of the FX market: the

spot market. Yet, as emphasized in this chapter when describing FX trading

activities, transactions in the FX market involve FX derivatives because of

the need for market participants to protect against adverse movements in the

FX rate. FX derivatives are used to control FX risk. Consequently, to

appreciate the need for FX derivatives, we describe FX risk.

Let us consider a financial transaction that needs to control FX risk,

because as mentioned, the dominant form of FX transactions is now

financial transactions. From the perspective of a U.S. investor, the cash

flows of assets denominated in a foreign currency expose the investor to

uncertainty as to the actual level of the cash flow measured in U.S. dollars.

The actual number of U.S. dollars that the investor eventually receives

depends on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign

currency at the time the nondollar cash flow is received and exchanged for

U.S. dollars. If the foreign currency depreciates (declines in value) relative

to the U.S. dollar (i.e., the U.S. dollar appreciates), the dollar value of the

cash flows will be proportionately less, leading to FX risk.

Any investor who purchases an asset denominated in a currency that is

not the medium of exchange in the investor's country faces FX risk. For

example, a French investor who acquires a yen-denominated Japanese bond

is exposed to the risk that the Japanese yen will decline in value relative to

the euro.

FX risk is a consideration for the issuer, too. Suppose that IBM issues

bonds denominated in euros. IBM's FX risk is that, at the time the coupon

interest payments must be made and the principal repaid, the U.S. dollar will

have depreciated relative to the euro, requiring that IBM pay more dollars to

satisfy its obligation.

**Sovereign debt** refers to the debt issued by the highest level of government
in a particular country. Sovereign governments occupy a central place in the
financial market. Not only are they among the largest single group of
borrowers in most countries, but the marketable debt issued by central
governments is considered to be the debt in a country that has the lowest
default risk. The reason is that central governments borrow in a currency
whose value they control. To pay off their nominal debt, governments can
simply print more money to pay off these claims. A notable exception is the
European Union, where member nations cede control of monetary policy to
the European Central Bank. Table 20.1 shows the amount of central bank
debt securities outstanding for 18 countries as of year-end 2016. Of the total
amount outstanding of almost US\$20.5 trillion, 59% was issued by the U.S.

government.

```
Table 20.1

```

Governments generate revenue to service their debt from two primary

sources. First, the government has, more or less, the unlimited power to tax

its citizens. This power can be exercised in the short run only. In the long

run, for governments that must face an electorate in fair and legitimate

elections, the electorate has the final say on the legitimacy of any tax policy.

The second source is the perception of unused capacity for additional

borrowing. The prospect of additional borrowing depends on the productive

capacity of the economy as well as the government's reputation for

management of its liabilities.

According to the World Bank, various benefits accrue to a country that

has a well-developed securities market. [1] First, a government securities

market provides a channel for the transmission and implementation of

monetary policy, especially monetary targets and inflation objectives.

Second, it provides another avenue to finance budget deficits other than the

central bank. Third, the existence of a sovereign debt market can enable

authorities to smooth consumption and investment expenditures in response

to macroeconomic shocks. Finally, a liquid and well-developed market can

almost certainly reduce the interest cost of debt over the medium and long

term.

Investors can be domiciled in the country where the central government

has issued the bond, or they can be foreign investors. In each of these

groups, we distinguish between financial entities—banks, contractual

savings entities, and collective investment funds—and nonfinancial entities

- nonfinancial firms and individual retail investors. Financial entities are

key players in the sovereign debt market. Commercial banks invest in

government securities for a variety of reasons. They use these securities to

meet liquid asset requirements, manage their interest rate risk, and provide

collateral for certain transactions (repurchase agreements described later in

this chapter). The contractual savings entities include pension funds and life

insurance companies. Their mission is to fund a liability structure. Because

their liabilities are long term, they are important buyers of longer-term

maturity government securities. Collective investment funds—including

bond mutual funds and money market funds—are active participants across

the entire yield curve.

In this chapter, we describe sovereign debt instruments and the markets in

which they trade. We explain who participates in this market and how the

securities are distributed to investors in the primary market and the role of

primary dealers in the process. Once securities are issued, they trade in the

secondary market. We highlight the role of an efficient and liquid secondary

market in financing governments. Important markets related to efficient

functioning of the sovereign debt market are also covered. Another

important aspect of a well-functioning sovereign debt market is interest rate

derivative contracts on sovereign bonds. We postpone discussion of these

instruments until chapter 37.

```
Types of Securities Issued

```

Central governments typically issue marketable and nonmarketable

securities. Our focus here is on marketable securities. Most sovereign

borrowers issue bonds with a fairly wide range of maturities. By doing so,

they move toward a benchmark yield which can aid in the pricing of other

debt instruments. Governments routinely issue two types of securities—

discount and coupon. A **discount security** pays a single cash flow at the end

- f its life. The difference between the maturity value and the purchase price
is the interest that the investor receives. An example of this type of security
is a three-month discount instrument sold by several governments, including
the United States and Switzerland. Most sovereign debt issued with an

- riginal maturity of one year or less is issued as discount securities. Table
20.2 lists the various maturities routinely issued as short-term securities for
selected countries.

```
Table 20.2

```

Maturities of short-term debt for selected countries.

In contrast to discount securities, **coupon securities** are issued with a

stated rate of interest, make interest payments periodically, and have a

terminal payment equal to their principal value. In some countries, such as

the United States, the interest payments are made semiannually. In others,

such as in many European countries, interest payments are made annually.

Sovereign debt with an original maturity of greater than one year is generally

issued as coupon securities. For example, securities issued by the

government of Singapore with maturities of two years or longer are coupon

securities where the interest payments are paid semiannually, and on the

maturity date, a principal payment is made. Table 20.3 lists the coupon

securities offered by selected countries. As can be seen from table 20.1, the

largest sector of the government bond market is that of fixed-rate bonds.

```
Table 20.3

```

Maturities for coupon debt securities 2–30 years and availability of stripping, selected countries.

In addition to discount instruments and fixed-rate coupon securities,

sovereigns issue two types whose payments are not fixed: inflation-adjusted

securities and floating-rate securities. **Inflation-adjusted securities** adjust

the payments (either coupon or principal) to investors for some measure of

the country's rate of inflation. **Floating-rate securities** are securities whose

interest payments change periodically according to a predetermined coupon

formula. The coupon formula includes a reference rate (benchmark interest

rate) adjusted with a spread. Developed countries that issue sovereign

floating-rate securities include Germany, Spain, Belgium, and the United

States. The United States only began issuing floating-rate securities in

January 2014. Developing countries that issue floating-rate debt include

Brazil, Turkey, Poland, and Indonesia. Two of the largest issuers of

sovereign debt, Japan and the United Kingdom, have never issued floatingrate debt. For selected countries, table 20.2 shows whether the government

issues floating-rate debt or inflation-indexed bonds. Floating-rate securities

and inflation-adjusted securities are described next.

```
Floating-Rate Securities

```

Governments around the world issue floating-rate securities. This type of

security, also referred to as a "floater," has a coupon rate that resets

periodically according to a predetermined formula, known to as the **coupon**

**formula** . The coupon formula for a basic floater consists of two parts: a

reference rate and a quoted margin.

A reference rate is some benchmark interest rate, such as 3-month

LIBOR. The quoted margin, commonly referred to as the "spread," can be

added to the reference rate or subtracted from the reference rate. The quoted

margin is a function of the level of rates as well as the floater's risk

exposure. For example, a floater's coupon formula could be 3-month LIBOR

plus 50 basis points. The reference rate is 3-month LIBOR, and the spread is

50 basis points. So for each period, the coupon rate is reset according to the

current level of 3-month LIBOR. In January 2014, the U.S. Treasury issued

floating-rate notes for the first time. Interest rates rise and fall on these

securities, based on the rate on of 13-week U.S. Treasury bills. The Republic

- f Argentina issued a floater in 2014 that matures on January 25, 2024, with
a coupon formula of BADLAR plus 200 basis points. (BADLAR is the
average interest paid by Argentine public or private banks for deposits in
excess of \$1 million.) Another example is the floater issued by the Polish
government in 2014 that matured March 28, 2017, with a coupon formula of
6-month WIBO flat. Flat means that the spread is zero. WIBO is the ACPI
Polska Poland Warsaw Interbank bid rate.

```
Inflation-Adjusted Securities

```

Sovereign governments, as well corporations, offer securities whose interest

rate is tied to the rate of inflation. These debt instruments, referred to as

**inflation-linked bonds**, or simply "linkers," have been issued by sovereign

governments since 1945. The earlier issuers of linkers were the governments

- f Argentina, Brazil, and Israel. The modern linker is attributed to the U.K.
government's index-linked gilt issued in 1981, followed by Australia,
Canada, and Sweden.

The United States introduced an inflation-linked security in January

1997, calling those securities **Treasury Inflation Protected Securities**

(TIPS). These securities carry the full faith and credit of the U.S.

government. Shortly after the introduction of TIPS in 1997, U.S.

government-related entities began issuing linkers.

Different designs can be used for linkers. The reference rate that is a

proxy for the inflation rate is changed according to some CPI. In the United

Kingdom, for example, the index used is the Retail Prices Index (All Items),

- r RPI. In France, there are two linkers with two different indexes: the
French CPI (excluding tobacco) and the Eurozone's Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP) (excluding tobacco). In the United States, the index
used is CPI—Urban, Nonseasonally Adjusted (denoted by CPI-U), as
calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [2]

Given the reference rate, the design of a linker can be such that over time,

the principal or the coupon income is adjusted for inflation between the date

- f issuance and the payment date of a cash flow. The most commonly used
design for a linker today calls for adjusting both the principal and the coupon
interest. Before maturity, prices for trades in the secondary market are
adjusted similarly. The inflation adjustment is usually done with a lag. This
structure is used in the United States for its linker (TIPS), with a three-month
lag in the CPI-U.

To highlight the differences between inflation-indexed bonds and

traditional bonds, consider two eight-year annual pay bonds—one traditional

bond and one inflation-indexed bond. The inflation-indexed bond has a real

coupon rate of 2% annually. Inflation is assumed to be a constant 1% per

year for the next eight years. The traditional bond has a coupon rate of 3%

annually. Both bonds have a principal value of \$100. Payments of the two

bonds are presented side-by-side in table 20.4. Note that for the traditional

bond, the nominal values for principal and coupon payments remain

constant, but their real values decline with inflation. To be sure, nominal

values are deflated by 1% per year with inflation. For the inflation-indexed

bond, just the opposite occurs. The real values remain constant, but the

nominal values for the principal and coupon payments increase with

inflation. Notice the coupon rate in the inflation-indexed bond remains

constant, but the coupon payments increase and coincide with the increase in

the inflation-adjusted principal. Nominal values are inflated by 1% per year

so as to keep real values constant.

```
Table 20.4

```

Comparison between a traditional bond and an inflation-adjusted bond.

The relationship between nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and

expectations of future inflation is thought to be governed by the Fisher

hypothesis. As explained in chapter 15, the Fisher hypothesis states that

nominal yield is approximately equal to the real yield plus the market's

expectation of future inflation. This relationship is an approximation,

because it does not include a term for the potential interaction between

inflation and the real economy. An implication of this relationship is that the

differential maturity-matched yields on nominal Treasury securities and

TIPS are often viewed as a proxy for the market's inflationary expectations.

```
Exhange Rate-Linked Securities

```

As can be seen from table 20.1, a small part of the central government

securities markets is exchange rate-linked government debt, also referred to

as principal exchange rate-linked government debt. The structure of this debt

instrument is that the principal depends on the exchange rate between the

U.S. dollar and some other currency, typically the exchange rate of the

issuing country. The two major issuers of this type of bond are Argentina

and Germany.

```
Primary Markets for Sovereign Debt

```

In chapter 17, we discussed primary markets. In the case of bond issuance,

the primary market is the market where securities are issued for the first

time. According to the World Bank, the structure of the primary market for

government bonds should accomplish the following five objectives: (1)

ensure cost effectiveness; (2) encourage participation from a wide range of

investors, including foreign institutions; (3) maximize competition; (4)

minimize placement risk; and (5) foster transparency. [3] The infrastructure of

the distribution channel must be well designed to meet these objectives.

The two key issues in structuring a primary market are the type of

distribution method and whether primary dealers necessary.

```
Distribution Methods

```

Various distribution methods are used in the primary sovereign debt markets.

The three primary distribution methods are (1) auctions; (2)

syndications/underwriting; and (3) tap sales. For countries with welldeveloped markets, the primary distribution method is an auction. Indeed,

auctions have proven to be more transparent and cost effective than other

selling methods. In developing markets, other methods, such as syndication,

underwriting, and tap sales, are used.

**`Auctions`** Many sovereigns use either a **single-price auction** (also called a
**uniform-price auction** ) or a **multiple-price auction** (also called a
"discriminatory auction") for all marketable securities issued. In a multipleprice auction, competitive bidders (e.g., primary dealers) state the amount of
the securities desired and the yields they are willing to accept. [4] The yields
are then ranked from lowest to highest. This ranking is equivalent to
arranging the bids from the highest price to the lowest price. Starting from
the lowest yield bid, all competitive bids are accepted until the amount to be
distributed to the competitive bidders is completely allocated. The highest
yield accepted by the sovereign is called the "stop yield," and bidders at that
yield are awarded a percentage of their total tender offer. The single-price
auction proceeds in the same fashion, except that all accepted bids are filled
at the highest yield of accepted competitive tenders (i.e., the stop yield).

To highlight the differences between these two types of auctions, let us

work a simple example. Assume a government has €500 million of 10-year

bonds to auction off. Bidders submit bids that include a yield and a quantity.

The information on the four bids is presented in the table 20.5. Starting at the

lowest yield, bids are accepted until the amount to be distributed is

exhausted. In our illustration, bids 1, 2, and 3 shown in table 20.5 would be

accepted. Bid 4 is shut out of the market and does not receive any securities.

The stop yield is 2.52%, and it is the highest accepted yield (the lowest

accepted price). In a multiple-price auction, all accepted bidders would pay

the price they bid for the quantity they bid. In contrast, in a single-price

auction, all accepted bids will pay the same price at the stop yield, and that

price is the lowest accepted bid. In our illustration, the stop yield is 2.62%,

so this the price all accepted bidders will pay.

```
Table 20.5

```

Bid Yield (%) Quantity (millions euro)

1 2.60 300

2 2.61 100

3 2.62 100

4 2.64 200

In the United States, the Treasury moved to single-price auctions for all

Treasury securities in 1998 after conducting single-price auctions for

monthly sales of twoand five-year notes since September 1992. Paul

Malvey and Christine Archibald conducted a study of the relative

performance of the two auction mechanisms. [5] Their empirical results suggest

that single-price auctions broaden participation and accordingly reduce the

concentration of securities at issuance. (By "concentration," we mean too

many securities owned by too few investors.) Moreover, they also present

somewhat weaker evidence that the single-price auctions reduce the

Treasury's financing costs. In principle, single-price auctions reduce

financing costs by encouraging more aggressive bidding relative to multipleprice auctions. Multiple-price auctions suffer from the so-called winner's

curse problem. [6] Conversely, in a single-price auction, all successful bidders

pay the same price and have less incentive to bid conservatively. Multipleprice auctions for a given quantity tend to shift the demand curve down and

to the left.

The frequency of auctions is a function of the debt management practices

- f the government and the desire to promote a liquid secondary market.
Short-term securities, such as bills, are usually auctioned weekly. In most
countries, the day of the week for the auction is fixed. Longer-term coupon
securities, such as notes and bonds, are typically auctioned less frequently,
usually monthly or quarterly. A well-defined schedule announced in advance
is believed to lead to a lower effective borrowing cost.

**`Syndication`** In less-well-developed markets with few bidders, auctions
may not be the best distribution channel. Instead, governments appoint a
group of financial institutions that, for a negotiable fee, will subscribe to the
entire bond issue and sell it to other investors. This process is usually
referred to as **syndication** . The key advantage of syndication is that it
reduces placement risk when demand for the securities is very uncertain.
Syndication also adds value if the government is trying to introduce a new
debt instrument. The main disadvantage of syndication is the lack of
transparency compared to an auction. Price and fees must be negotiated with
the financial institutions that will subscribe to the issue. Auctions are more

transparent, because such negotiation is not required.

An alternative method for selling government securities is called

**underwriting** . The government establishes a minimum price for a debt issue

to be sold. For a commission, the underwriter subscribes to the entire issue at

the minimum price. The underwriter can then retain the portion of the issue

it desires and sells the rest to other investors.

**`Tap sales`** A **tap sale** is a method of distributing securities that allows
issuers to sell additional bonds from past issues. The bonds are sold at their
current market price but retain their original face value, coupon rate, and
maturity. The British and French governments have issued additional
securities using this method. Advantages to the issuer include avoiding some

- f the fixed costs of auctioning off new securities. This method is used for
issuing a small principal amount of a security when the cost of a new issue is
prohibitive.

```
Primary Dealers

```

A key component of the primary market for any government's securities is

the participation of a group of primary dealers. A **primary dealer** is a

designated intermediary who, in exchange for special status, is obligated to

be a meaningful participant in the primary market and an active market

maker in the secondary market. A primary dealer is usually designated by

the central bank. By "active market maker," we mean a dealer willing and

able to quote two-way prices (bids and offers) for some or all securities. The

risk of endowing a small group of financial institutions special status is that

it might encourage collusion. This prospect is more likely when fewer

primary dealers are involved and the markets are less well developed. To

preclude this possibility, how primary dealers are selected, organized, and

monitored becomes an important policy decision.

In the United States, primary dealers are specially designated banks and

investment banks that are selected and regulated by the Federal Reserve.

They are invariably large and well capitalized. Being a primary dealer has

benefits as well as obligations. Primary dealers have the exclusive right to

trade with the Federal Reserve when it is conducting open market

- perations. Primary dealers are expected to be active participants in the
Treasury primary and secondary markets and to quote two-sided markets.
The Federal Reserve actively monitors the participation of primary dealers,
and if their performance is found to be wanting, the firm risks removal from
the primary dealer list.

As another example, Italy established a primary dealer system of 16

dealers or specialists in 1994 under the supervision of the Ministry of

Finance. The specialists consist of both investment and commercial banks,

including foreign institutions. They are obligated to bid at government

securities auctions and quote two-way prices in the secondary market. In

exchange, the specialists garner exclusive access to tap sales and buybacks. [7]

Specialist status is reviewed every two years.

```
Secondary Markets

```

As explained in chapter 18, secondary markets are where previously issued

securities are traded among investors. Securities can be traded directly from

investor to investor, or through a broker or primary dealer to facilitate the

transaction. The major participants in secondary government bond markets

globally are large institutional investors and central banks. The presence of

retail investors in secondary government securities market is small.

The secondary market for government securities must provide for the

immediate purchase and sale of securities. According to the World Bank,

transactions in the secondary market should possess the following

characteristics: (1) low transaction costs, (2) continuous and widely

disseminated price information, (3) immediate execution of trades, (4) a safe

and rapid settlement system, and (5) efficient custodial and safekeeping

services.

A hallmark of a liquid, well-developed market is how it handles spot

transactions. A spot transaction is the immediate purchase and sale of a

security. An important gauge of a market's efficiency is the amount of time

between trade execution and settlement. The shorter the gap is, the more

cash-like securities become. **Settlement** is the process that occurs after the

trade is made. The bonds are delivered to the buyer for payment received

from the seller. Secondary market settlement for government bonds typically

takes place on a T + 1 basis—that is, the day after the transaction date. Cash

settlement, in which trading and settlement occur the same day, is standard

for most governments in developed secondary markets. Trades clear in either

(or both) of the two main clearing systems, Euroclear and Clearstream.

Settlement occurs by means of a simultaneous exchange of bonds for cash

- n the books of the clearing system. An electronic bridge connecting
Euroclear and Clearstream allows transfer of bonds from one system to the

- ther.

In Japan, the Bank of Japan oversees the payment and settlement systems

and provides settlement accounts on those systems. For securities settlement,

the Bank of Japan is responsible for settling all Japanese government bond

transactions. Japanese government bond transactions are settled on a real

time delivery-versus-payment basis through BOJ-NET JBG Services, an

- nline system for transferring Japanese government bonds between financial
institutions.

Secondary markets are mainly structured in one of two ways: as an

- rganized exchange or as an OTC market. An organized exchange provides

a place where buyers and sellers can meet to arrange their trades. Although

buy or sell orders may come from anywhere, the transaction must take place

at the exchange according to the rules imposed by the exchange. In contrast,

with OTC markets, buy and sell orders initiated from various locations are

matched through a communications network. Thus, OTC markets need

electronic trading platforms, through which users submit buy and sell orders.

Bloomberg Fixed Income Electronic Trading platform is an example of such

a platform, through which dealers stand ready to trade in multiple bond

markets globally. Although there is some trading of government bonds and

very active corporate bonds on many stock exchanges around the world,

nearly all bonds are traded in OTC markets.

The secondary market for U.S. Treasuries is an OTC market where a

group of U.S. government securities dealers offers continuous bid and ask

prices on outstanding Treasuries for a virtual 24-hour trading of Treasury

securities. The three primary trading locations are New York, London, and

Tokyo. The normal settlement period for Treasury securities is the business

day after the transaction day ("next day" settlement).

The most recently auctioned issue of a particular maturity Treasury is

referred to as the **on-the-run issue** - r the **current issue.** For example, the

most recently issued 10-year Treasury notes is called the on-the-run 10-year

- r the current 10-year. Securities that are replaced by the on-the-run issue are
called **off-the-run issues** . Sometimes traders use the terms "one-off-the-run"

and "two-off-the-run" to indicate how recently a Treasury was issued. Issues

replaced by several on-the-run issues are said to be "well-off-the-run issues."

Despite the huge volume of trading in the secondary market for

government securities, the reporting of trades (i.e., the transparency of the

market) is not at the level of that of U.S. common stocks. However, the

reporting of government securities transactions has made some major strides

since 1991. These developments came from the private sector. The

prominent example is GovPX. This firm, created in 1990 by primary dealers

and interdealer brokers (described below) in the government securities

market, provides 24-hour, worldwide distribution of government securities

information as transacted by market participants through interdealer brokers.

The information reported by GovPX consists of the price and size of the best

bid and offer, and current repo rates and volume (intraday updates) for repo

transactions. The information reported by this firm is primarily distributed as

an optional service through the major market data vendors (Bloomberg,

Reuters, and Telerate) and to client sites.

Treasury dealers trade with the investing public and with other dealer

firms. When they trade with each other, it is through intermediaries known

as **interdealer brokers** _**.**_ Dealers use interdealer brokers because of the speed

and efficiency with which trades can be accomplished. Interdealer brokers

do not trade for their own account, keeping the names of the dealers

involved in the trades confidential. Interdealer brokers match buyers and

sellers of Treasury securities (anonymously) and receive a brokerage fee if a

match can be obtained. The quotations provided on the government dealer

screens represent prices in the "inside" or "interdealer" market.

```
Stripping and Reconstitution

```

Longer-term zero-coupon securities are not typically issued by sovereign

governments. Instead, they are created by market participants using a

process called "stripping and reconstitution." Market participants have the

ability to separate the bond's individual coupon payments and trade them as

separate zero-coupon securities. This process is called **stripping** . Moreover,

dealers can recombine the appropriate individual zero-coupon securities and

reproduce the underlying coupon sovereign debt instrument. To do so, the

entity that seeks to reconstitute a security must obtain the appropriate

principal strip and all unmatured interest components for the security being

reconstituted. This process is called **reconstitution** .

To illustrate this process, consider a 2% coupon U.K. gilt issued by the

British government that matures on September 7, 2025. There are two series

- f gilts that are strippable. The first series, those coupon-paying instruments
whose coupon dates are June 7 and December 7, became strippable in
December 1997. The second series, those paying coupons on March 7 and
September 7, became strippable in April 2002. Only gilt-edged market
makers, the British Treasury, and The Bank of England may strip and
reconstitute gilts. All stripping and reconstituting of gilts is done through the
Gilt Strips Facility.

Table 20.6 is a representation of the 21 remaining payments—20 coupon

payments of £10,000 and a maturity value payment of £1,000,000. Each one

- f these payments can trade separately from the whole as a zero-coupon
bond that matures on the day it is due. A distinction is made between zerocoupon securities derived from coupon payments and those derived from
principal payments. Zero-coupon securities created from coupon payments
are called "coupon strips.' Zero-coupon securities created from principal
payments are called "principal strips."

In many countries, a disadvantage of a taxable entity investing in

government strips is that accrued interest is taxed each year, even though

interest is not paid. Thus, these instruments are negative cash flow

instruments until the maturity date. They are negative cash flows, because

tax payments on interest earned but not received must be made. One reason

for distinguishing between strips created from the principal and those created

from the coupon is that some non-U.S. buyers have a preference for strips

created from the principal (i.e., principal strips) because of the tax treatment

- f the interest in their home country. Some country's tax laws treat the
interest as a capital gain if the principal strip is purchased. The capital gain
receives a preferential tax treatment (i.e., lower rate) compared to ordinary
income.

```
Repurchase Agreements

```

A **repurchase agreement** (or simply "repo") is the sale of a security with a

simultaneous agreement by the seller to buy the same security back at a

future date from the purchaser at an agreed-on price. [8] In practical terms, a

repurchase agreement can be viewed as a collateralized loan where the

security sold and subsequently repurchased represents the collateral posted.

One party is borrowing money and providing collateral for the loan at an

interest rate. The interest rate, referred to as the **repo rate**, is typically lower

than the rate on an otherwise similar bank loan. The other party is lending

money while accepting a security as collateral for the loan. Therefore, the

seller in a repo is effectively a secured lender.

Repos are a common source of funding for dealer firms in many

countries around the world. An active market in repos underpins every liquid

bond market. Financial and nonfinancial institutions participate actively in

the market as both sellers and buyers of collateral, depending on their

circumstances. Central banks are also active users of repurchase agreements

in their daily money market operations, to either lend to the market to

increase the supply of funds or withdraw surplus funds from the market.

**`Structure of repo and reverse repurchase agreements`** Consider a
dealer that has a forecast on the direction of interest rates in a country and
this forecast is expected to materialize over the next 24 hours. The dealer
decides to take a long position in that country's 10-year government security.

How will the dealer finance the position in the government security?

Suppose the dealer wants to fund the position overnight and through the next

business day. The dealer has two basic choices—use its own funds or borrow

the funds. Dealers usually opt to employ leverage to fund the position. The

dealer could borrow the money from a bank. However, in these

circumstances, the dealer chooses to enter into a repo to fund the position.

As noted above, a repo is a collateralized loan where one party is providing

collateral and borrowing money and the counterparty is accepting collateral

and lending money. A repurchase agreement may be constructed as follows:

The dealer sells the 30-year government security to a counterparty for cash

today. At the same time, the dealer makes a promise to buy the same 30-year

government security on the next business day for an agreed-on price. The

price at which the dealer repurchases the gilt is known as the repurchase

price. The date when the 30-year government security is repurchased, the

next business day in this example, is called the **repurchase date** . When the

term of a repurchase agreement is one day, it is called an "overnight repo,"

which can be rolled over. When the agreement is for more than one day, it is

called a **term repo** .

Just as there is no single interest rate, there is no one repo rate. The rate

varies from agreement to agreement owing to various factors: quality of the

collateral, term of the repo, delivery requirement, availability of the

collateral, and the prevailing rates on alternative fund sources. In the United

States, the alternative funding sources would be the federal funds rate for

some institutions. The repo rate is inversely related to the quality of the

collateral. Rates differ by maturity and the current shape of the benchmark

yield curve. If delivery of the collateral is required, the repo rate will be

lower. The more difficult it is to obtain the collateral, the lower the repo rate

will be. The more difficult it is to obtain the collateral, the lower the repo

rate will be. To understand why this is so, remember that the borrower (or

equivalently, the seller of the collateral) has a security that lenders of cash

want, for whatever reason. Such collateral is referred to as **hot collateral** - r

**special collateral** . Collateral that does not have this characteristic is referred

to as **general collateral** . The party that needs the hot collateral will be

willing to lend funds at a lower repo rate to obtain the collateral.

In the example above, a dealer is using a repurchase agreement to fund a

long position in a 30-year government security. Simply put, the dealer is

borrowing money. A repurchase agreement can also be used to borrow

securities to establish a short position. In this case, the dealer is lending

money and accepting securities the dealer wants as collateral. The

counterparty is borrowing money and providing securities as collateral. This

transaction is called a **reverse repurchase agreement** - r simply a "reverse."

In market parlance, what distinguishes a repo from a reverse repo is always

viewed from the perspective of the dealer. If the dealer is borrowing money,

it is a repo. If the dealer is borrowing securities, it is a reverse. Both types of

transaction are otherwise structured the same.

```
Sovereign Credit Risk

```

Sovereign debt exposes investors to **credit risk** as varied as that observed in

- ther debt markets discussed in this book. Sovereign ratings are credit

ratings for countries as assigned by the credit rating agencies that we

described in chapter 5. Specifically, sovereign ratings are assessments of the

relative likelihood that a borrower (i.e., a central government) will default on

its obligations. Governments seek these credit ratings to increase their access

to international capital markets. Sovereign ratings matter to investors,

because other things being equal, investors prefer rated issues to unrated

- nes. They matter to borrowers as well, because the rating agencies are
reluctant to assign a credit rating to a lower level of government or
corporation that is higher than that of the issuer's home country.

Two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies: a **local**

**currency debt rating** and a **foreign currency debt rating.** The two general

categories of risk analyzed when assigning ratings are **economic risk** and

**political risk** . The former category is an assessment of the ability of a

government to satisfy its obligations. Both quantitative and qualitative

analyses are used when assessing economic risk. Political risk is an

assessment of the willingness of a government to satisfy its obligations. A

government may have the ability but may be unwilling to pay. Political risk

is assessed based on qualitative analysis of the political factors that influence

a government's economic policies.

The reason for distinguishing between local debt ratings and foreign

currency debt ratings is that historically, the default frequency differs by the

currency denomination of the debt. Specifically, defaults have been greater

- n foreign currency–denominated debt. The reason for the difference in
default rates for local currency debt and foreign currency debt is that if a
government is willing to raise taxes and control its domestic financial
system, it can generate sufficient local currency to meet its local currency
debt obligation. This is not the case with foreign currency–denominated
debt. A national government must purchase foreign currency to meet a debt

- bligation in that foreign currency and therefore has less control with respect
to its exchange rate. Thus, a significant depreciation of the local currency
relative to a foreign currency in which a debt obligation is denominated will
impair a national government's ability to satisfy such obligations. This
distinction is not observed with the 17 countries of the European Union's

Eurozone, where there is only a single credit rating for a sovereign's issues,

irrespective of what currency the country is issuing.

Those borrowers perceived to have the lowest default risk receive the

coveted AAA/Aaa rating from the three credit rating agencies. As of yearend 2015, only nine sovereign issuers are rated at this (theoretically) riskfree level (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway,

Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland). The 2007–2009 global financial crisis

resulted in many sovereign issuers taking on potentially unsustainable debt

loads when they took over the liabilities of their country's failed banks.

Subsequently, many sovereigns suffered downgrades from the AAA/Aaa

level, including Ireland in 2009 and Spain in 2010. In August 2011, one

rating agency, S&P, lowered the AAA credit rating of the United States for

the first time since assigning sovereign credit ratings in 1917.

A country whose domestic currency is a liquid currency, and which

boasts a sizeable domestic institutional savings base, has the capacity to fund

its debt in local currency. [9] However, where there is a demand for it, either

from foreign investors or for issues in another currency, a sovereign may

also issue in a foreign currency. When this occurs, it will usually swap the

proceeds into its local currency. A demand for a particular sovereign name

from different investors may cause the issuer to raise debt in a foreign

currency; this is common for highly rated borrowers, such as Switzerland,

Finland, and Sweden, which issue U.S. dollar and euro debt.

The factors analyzed when assessing the creditworthiness of a national

government's local currency debt and foreign currency debt will differ to

some extent. When assessing the credit quality of local currency debt, for

example, one rating agency, S&P, emphasizes domestic government policies

that foster or impede timely debt service.

When assigning a rating for a country's foreign currency debt, credit

analysis by S&P focuses on the interaction of domestic and foreign

government policies. S&P analyzes a country's balance of payments and the

structure of its external balance sheet. The areas of analysis with respect to

its external balance sheet are the net public debt, total net external debt, and

net external liabilities.

Moody's, another major rating agency, focuses on the following four

factors as the foundation of its sovereign bond ratings methodology: (1)

economic strength—wealth, size, diversification, and long-term potential;

(2) institutional strength—governance, quality of institutions, and policy

predictability; (3) government financial strength—ability to deploy resources

to face current and expected liabilities; and (4) susceptibility to event risk—

risk of sudden change in risk migration. [10]

```
Key Points

```

- Sovereign debt refers to the debt issued by the highest level of government
in a particular country.

   - There are two types of government securities issued—discount and

coupon.

   - A discount security pays a single cash flow at the end of its life; the
difference between the maturity value and the purchase price is the
interest that the investor receives.

   - Coupon securities are issued with a stated rate of interest, make
interest payments periodically, and have terminal payments equal to
their principal value.

   - Floating-rate securities are securities whose interest payments change
periodically according to a predetermined coupon formula.

   - The coupon formula for a basic floater consists of two parts: a
reference rate and a quoted margin.

   - Inflation-adjusted securities adjust the payments (either coupon or
principal) to investors for some measure of the country's rate of
inflation.

   - The U.S. inflation-linked securities are referred to as Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).

   - Different designs can be used for inflation-adjusted securities.
   - Given the reference rate, the design of an inflation-adjusted security
can be such that over time, the principal and/or the coupon income are
adjusted for inflation between the date of issuance and the payment date

   - f a cash flow.
- A small part of the central government securities markets is exchange
rate–linked government debt. The structure of this debt instrument is
that the principal depends on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar
and some other currency, typically that of the issuing country.

- The structure of the primary market for government bonds should
accomplish five objectives: (1) ensure cost-effectiveness; (2) encourage
participation from a wide range of investors, including foreign
institutions; (3) maximize competition; (4) minimize placement risk;
and (5) foster transparency.

- The three distribution methods used in the primary sovereign debt
markets are (1) auctions; (2) syndications/underwriting; and (3) tap
sales.

- For countries with well-developed markets, the primary distribution
method is an auction.

- Many sovereigns use either a single-price auction or a multiple-price
auction to distribute marketable securities at issue.

- A primary dealer is a designated intermediary who is obligated to be
an active participant in both the primary and secondary markets.

- Secondary markets are where previously issued securities are traded
among investors.

- The process of breaking apart coupon securities to create zero-coupon
securities is called "stripping."

- The process of reassembling coupon securities from a portfolio of
strips is called "reconstitution."

- Repurchase agreements (repos) are a primary source of financing for
government securities dealers.

- Sovereign ratings are assessments by credit rating agencies of the
relative likelihood that a borrower (i.e., a central government) will
default on its obligations.

- Two sovereign debt ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies: a
local currency debt rating and a foreign currency debt rating.

- The two general categories of risk analyzed by credit rating agencies
when assigning ratings are economic risk and political risk.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - what subnationals are;
  - the need for subnationals to obtain financing for large-scale
infrastructure projects in developing and developed countries;

   - the two types of municipal debt structures: bank lending and bond
issuance;

   - what a municipal bank is;
   - what a municipal bond bank is;
   - the role of multilateral financial institutions in the development of a
sustainable municipal debt market in developing countries;

   - the use of public-private partnerships and project finance initiatives
in infrastructure financing for subnationals;

   - what green bonds are;
   - the types of U.S. municipal bond structures;
  - the difference between tax-exempt municipal bonds and taxable
municipal bonds;

   - the credit risk associated with U.S. municipal securities;
   - the factors considered by credit rating agencies when rating U.S.
municipal securities;

   - what the municipal bankruptcy process is in the United States;
   - the secondary market for municipal bonds; and
   - the actions taken by the People's Republic of China to create a
sustainable municipal bond market.

Subnational governments include states, regions, provinces, counties, and

municipalities, as well as local utilities companies either owned or regulated

by these entities. In the United States, the SEC has reported that there are

about 44,000 state and local entities that issue securities. Dexia reports that

the number of subnational governments in the European Union is 90,380,

which included 89,149 municipalities, 981 entities referred to as

"intermediary entities" (which includes departments and provinces), and

250 regions. For the 27 member countries in the European Union, 80% of

the 89,149 municipalities are located in five countries: France (41%),

Germany (13%), Spain (9%), Italy (9%), and Czech Republic (7%).

Subnational governments need to obtain proceeds to fulfill their

delegated responsibilities. They traditionally derive their revenue from one

- r more of the following sources: (1) tax revenue (income taxes, property
taxes, and sales taxes); (2) share of revenue from the central government;
(3) fees and charges on local services provided; (4) asset sales; (5)
investment income; and (6) grants from nongovernmental organizations. [1]

To obtain the necessary funding to operate a subnational government,

the revenue sources of funding are combined with some debt arrangement

(bank borrowing or the issuance of bonds). With the rapid industrialization

and urbanization in developing countries has come the need for funding

large-scale investments in infrastructure. For developed countries, the aging

- f its infrastructure will require a substantial commitment of capital.
Although in both developed and developing economies, some financing
will come from central governments and multilateral financial institutions,
the rest must come from the subnationals themselves and any debt funding
that they can obtain. Estimates for what the global need will be for
infrastructure financing is provided by McKinsey, a consulting firm.
McKinsey estimates that between 2012 and 2030, \$57 trillion will be
needed globally for infrastructure. For this reason, central governments in
many countries are seeking ways to improve their municipal debt market.

In this chapter, we describe the issues concerning the development of

subnational or municipal debt markets, including the two types of models

for obtaining debt. These structures include the bank lending model and the

bond issuance model. The first model mentioned has severe limitations, and

therefore the major push in many countries is to develop the municipal

bond market. Because the U.S. municipal bond market is an example of a

well-developed bond issuance market, we describe this market in

considerable detail in this chapter.

```
Central Government Control of Municipal Borrowing

```

A key issue that arises regarding the raising of funds in the financial

markets by subnational governments is whether central governments should

regulate subnational borrowing. The argument has been made that such

regulation is unnecessary, because investors in financial markets will

discipline subnational borrowing. Excessive borrowing as perceived by

market participants would be discouraged as borrowing costs rise. Bank

borrowing would become too expensive.

This view, however, is based on assumptions that if not true would

require central government control over subnational borrowers. The

assumptions include (1) lenders have sufficient information about the

subnationals that they are providing funding for; (2) local governments

respond in an appropriate manner to private market signals, thus avoiding

being shut out of the credit market; and (3) lenders believe that there will be

a central government bailout should the subnational default. Given that it is

not likely that these assumptions will hold in real world markets, it is

argued that the development of a credit market for subnationals would

benefit from some central government regulations and control. [2]

```
Structure of a Municipal Credit Market

```

Central governments have two models from which to develop their

subnational debt markets. The first is via bank lending, and the second is

the issuance of municipal bonds. Bank lending to subnationals is the

primary source for funding subnationals today in Europe and Asia, but in

North America, the primary source is municipal bonds. Of course, a hybrid

- f the two can be used.

```
Bank Lending Model

```

Some banks specialize in lending to subnationals. The largest one is Credit

Local de France, which is now part of the Dexia Group. These banks have

- ffered loans for investment projects of from 15 to 30 years. Municipal
banks seek to establish a permanent partnership with subnationals. The
typical services that they provide to supplement their lending include
preparing and structuring budgets, planning and designing investment
projects that a subnational is considering financing, managing the
subnational's finances, and serving as an intermediary between the

subnational and central government in matters related to tax-sharing

arrangements and grant allocations. [3]

Municipal banks often are granted certain advantages in performing

their role of providing loans for subnationals. The banks in some countries

are given a legal monopoly for lending to subnationals. Municipal banks

have access to some form of below-market interest rate funds not available

to other types of banks. Municipal banks often benefit from laws that

require that municipalities deposit accounts with them. The interest paid on

those deposits is a below-market interest rate.

The environment has been changing for municipal banks due to financial

sector deregulation. Legal monopolies are disappearing, forcing municipal

banks to compete with other financial institutions to borrow funds. As a

result of financial sector deregulation, municipal banks have lost access to

below-market interest rates, again requiring that they complete with

financial institutions (in particular, commercial banks). The type of

relationship banking that existed when municipal banks dominated has

disappeared, and subnationals now must compete with corporate and

consumer borrowers for available funding. Commercial banks traditionally

have been less likely sources for funding long-term infrastructure projects.

For this reason, central governments have fostered the development of a

municipal bond market.

```
Bond Issuance Model

```

Raising funds via the issuance of bonds is quite a different avenue for fund

raising than is borrowing from municipal banks. Although investment

bankers do seek to establish long-term relationships with a subnational,

each time a subnational comes to market with a bond offering, competition

among investment bankers dictates who would be the underwriter of that

issue. This type of competition, particularly for subnationals who frequently

come to market with a bond offering, is likely to result in a lower funding

cost.

For small subnationals that do not come to market frequently, the lowercost funds may not be realized. This can be partially overcome by bond

banks that are quasi-government entities. These banks purchase bonds from

smaller subnationals that are infrequent issuers in the bond market, pool the

bonds to create another bond issue backed by the pooled bonds, and resell

them to the public. Because the pooled bonds can be issued at a higher

credit rating than that of the bonds issued by individual subnationals, the

interest rate that must be paid on pooled bonds will be less than what must

be paid for individual subnationals. The benefits of the lower cost can be

passed through to the individual subnationals. In the United States,

examples of bond banks are the Maine Municipal Bond Bank and the

Indiana Bond Bank, both established by their respective states.

The development of the municipal bond market in any country requires

the introduction of credit ratings by credit rating agencies (CRAs), the

entities that were the subject of chapter 5. As explained later in this chapter,

CRAs evaluate various factors pertaining to the entity that they are rating.

One of the major factors is the entity's financial condition. A rating will not

be assigned if reliable financial information is not available. In the case of

rating the bond of a subnational, CRAs need information about its local

budget, all financial obligations outstanding, and its arrangements with the

central government. These ratings are necessary for certain investors in the

country to purchase the subnational bond and, in many countries, a

minimum rating is needed before the central government will permit the

subnational to issue the bond. Recall from our discussion of CRAs in

chapter 5 that because the rating is an issuer-pay model, there is concern

that CRAs may give in to economic pressure to give the rating necessary for

the subnational to obtain approval from the central government.

The U.S. municipal bond market is the model that has proved to be

highly successful in facilitating funding for states, counties, and townships.

Later in this chapter, we focus on the U.S. municipal bond market, which is

a highly successful municipal debt market.

```
Multilateral Financial Institution Arrangements

```

Multilateral financial institutions, which are also referred to as

supranationals, include the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank

Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the

European Investment Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Global

Environmental Fund. It has been argued that the greatest need for

infrastructure financing in developing markets is Asia because of its rate of

urbanization. The Asian Development Bank estimated that \$8 trillion worth

- f infrastructure projects would be needed in Asia simply to maintain the
region's economic growth rates. Recognizing this growing need for
infrastructure financing, in 2015 China led the creation of the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank. This bank has 57 founding member
countries that committed \$100 billion in capital to fund infrastructure
projects in the region. China contributed \$30 million. Japan has committed
to inject a significant amount.

The experience of multilateral institutions in fostering the development

- f a sustainable bond municipal debt market is sort of a puzzle. Take the
case of Brazil, which has used loans from multilateral institutions for more
than 30 years to develop a municipal debt market. Despite the many
successes of this type of financing in terms of low rates of nonperforming
municipal loans and investment projects that have been successful, market

- bservers believe that Brazil "is as far away as ever from having a
functioning local credit market." [4] Brazil's subnationals are not allowed to
issue bonds, and because private banks view lending to subnationals as too
risky, they do not make intermediateand long-term loans. To obtain any

- ther type of borrowing, central government approval is required on a caseby-case basis.

To foster infrastructure financing in developing economies, multilateral

institutions use public-private partnerships and project finance initiatives,

which we discuss next.

```
Infrastructure Financing via Project Finance and Public-Private
Partnerships

```

The substantial worldwide need for financing infrastructure projects and the

constraints on the budgets of subnationals has resulted in some countries

turning to the private sector. This is done by either a public-private

partnership or direct financing of projects (referred to as **project finance**

**initiatives** ). [5] These alternative funding arrangements are attractive, because

they typically do not appear as part of a subnational's budget. For this

reason, they are referred to as "off-budget" mechanisms.

A **public-private partnership** (PPP) is an agreement between a public

agency or government department and a private sector entity (or entities)

that calls for the procurement, building, or development of a facility or

service and that shares risks and rewards between the public and private

sector partners. This is very often in the form of a concession agreement,

which is a contract between a private sector entity and a government entity

to operate a specific service within that government entity's jurisdiction,

subject to certain restrictions. However, this may sometimes take the form

- f a privately funded project known as a **private finance initiative** (PFI). [6]

The key distinction between a PPP and a PFI is that a PPP describes the

- verarching approach used to assist in more efficient procurement or
management of projects that may be only partly privatized. Consequently,
some or all of the ownership of the project remains in the hands of the
government entity that has partnered with the private sector entity, and the
project is set up to operate the facilities through a concession agreement. In
contrast, PFIs include fund raising for the project and usually a shift in

- wnership—even if only during the lifetime of the finance—to the private
sector. Despite this distinction, sometimes the terms PPP and PFI are used
interchangeably.

Although there are many reasons for a subnational using PPP and PFI to

finance infrastructure projects, one of the major ones is that these

arrangements will lower interest cost compared with the same project

financed through the public sector.

The largest PPP in the United States is the \$4 billion LaGuardia Airport

Terminal B redevelopment project in New York. The partnership is between

the LaGuardia Gateway Partners, and the subnational entity is the Port

Authority of New York and New Jersey. The purpose of the PPP is to build

a new state-of-the art 1.3 million square foot LaGuardia Airport Central

Terminal B and manage the terminal operations to better meet the needs of

the 15 million passengers who use the terminal each year and the four

airlines who use the terminal as their home (American Airlines, United,

Southwest, and Air Canada). The LaGuardia Gateway Partners include

Municipal Green Bond Issuance

```

Green bonds are issued by supranationals, development banks,

governments, and corporations. The largest issuers are the European

Investment Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and

Development, the African Development Bank, and the International

Finance Corporation. [7]

A "green project" refers to a project or activity that promotes climate or

- ther environmental sustainability goals. **Green bonds** are financial
instruments whose proceeds are used solely to finance new and existing
green projects. The catalysts for the introduction and growth of the green
bond market are the World Bank Group and the European Development
Bank. [8] The World Bank has issued green bonds since 2008; through mid2013, it had 67 transactions in 17 currencies totaling more than \$6.4
billion. [9] In 2014, a local government agency in Norway. Kommunalbanken
AS, issued a \$550 million green bond.

The bonds are issued in response to specific investor demand for a

triple-A-rated product that supports projects to mitigate climate change or

to help those people affected by climate change adapt to it. The first green

bond investors were a group of Scandinavian pension funds seeking

"investment opportunities for the fixed income portion of their portfolios

that would help them support climate mitigation and adaptation projects." [10]

Voluntary transparency and disclosure guidelines, referred to as the

Green Bond Principles, have been formulated for the purpose of promoting

the integrity and development of the green bond market. [11] The broad

categories of potentially eligible green projects to which the bond proceeds

can be applied, as suggested by the Green Bond Principles, include (but are

not limited to) renewable energy, energy efficiency (including energyefficient buildings), sustainable waste management, sustainable land use

(including sustainable forestry and agriculture), biodiversity conservation,

clean transportation, and clean water or drinking water. Green bonds are

classified, mostly by intended use, into four types: green proceeds bonds,

green revenue bonds, green project bonds, and green securitized bonds. [12]

```
U.S. Municipal Securities Market

```

U.S. municipal securities are issued by state and local governments and by

the entities that they establish. All states issue municipal securities. Local

governments include cities and counties. Political subdivisions of

municipalities that issue securities include school districts and special

districts for fire prevention, water, sewer, and other purposes. Public

agencies or instrumentalities include authorities and commissions.

Municipal bonds are issued for various purposes. Short-term notes

typically are sold in anticipation of the receipt of funds from taxes or

proceeds from the sale of a bond issue, for example. The proceeds from the

sale of short-term notes permit the issuing municipality to cover seasonal

and temporary imbalances between outlays for expenditures and tax

inflows. Municipalities issue long-term bonds as the principal means for

financing both (1) long-term capital projects (such as the construction of

schools, bridges, roads, and airports) and (2) long-term budget deficits that

arise from current operations.

The municipal bond market includes two sectors: the tax-exempt bond

sector and the taxable bond sector. The attractiveness of tax-exempt

municipal securities is due to their tax treatment at the federal income tax

level. Most municipal securities are tax exempt, which means that interest

- n the security is exempt from federal income taxation. The exemption
applies to interest income, not capital gains. The exemption may or may not
extend to the state and local levels. Each state has its own rules as to how

interest on municipal securities is taxed. [13] The taxable municipal bond

sector, by far the smaller sector, includes bonds whose interest is taxed at

the federal income tax level.

Historically, investors in municipal securities have included retail

investors, mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, bank

trust departments, and property and casualty insurance companies. These

investors are interested in the tax-exempt feature of municipal securities.

Retail investors either directly or indirectly through their ownership of

collective investment vehicles (i.e., mutual funds, closed-end funds, or

exchange-traded funds) own 75% of the municipal securities outstanding.

More recently, hedge funds, arbitrageurs, life insurance companies, and

foreign banks have become important participants. These investors are not

interested in the tax-exempt feature. Instead, their primary interest is in

- pportunities to benefit from leveraged strategies that seek to generate
capital gains.

```
Types and Features of Municipal Bonds

```

The two basic types of municipal security structures are tax-backed debt

and revenue bonds. Other securities share characteristics of tax-backed debt

and revenue bonds. [14]

**`Tax-backed debt`** Debt issued by states, counties, special districts, cities,
towns, and school districts and secured by some form of tax revenue is
called **tax-backed debt** . This type of debt includes general obligation debt,
appropriation-backed obligations, and debt obligations supported by public
credit enhancement programs.

The broadest type of tax-backed debt is **general obligation debt** . The

two types of general obligation pledges are unlimited and limited. An

unlimited tax general obligation debt is the stronger form of general

- bligation pledge, because it is secured by the issuer's unlimited taxing
power. Tax revenue sources include corporate and individual income taxes,
sales taxes, and property taxes. Unlimited tax general obligation debt is said
to be secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer. A limited tax general

- bligation debt is a limited tax pledge because of a statutory limit on the tax
rates the issuer may levy to service the debt.

Certain general obligation bonds are secured not only by the issuer's

general taxing powers to create revenues accumulated in a general fund but

also by certain identified fees, grants, and special charges, which provide

additional revenues from outside the general fund. Such bonds are

considered to be double-barreled in security because of the dual nature of

the revenue sources. For example, the debt obligations issued by special

purpose service systems may be secured by a pledge of property taxes, a

pledge of special fees/operating revenue from the service provided, or a

pledge of both property taxes and special fees/operating revenues. In the

last case, they are double barreled.

Agencies or authorities of several states issue bonds that carry a

potential state liability for making up shortfalls in the issuing entity's

.

- bligation. This type of debt is called an a **ppropriation-backed obligation**
The appropriation of funds from the state's general tax revenue must be
approved by the state legislature. However, the state's pledge is not binding.
Debt obligations with this nonbinding pledge of tax revenue are called
**moral obligation bonds** . Because a moral obligation bond requires
legislative approval to appropriate the funds, it is classified as an
appropriation-backed obligation. The purpose of the moral obligation
pledge is to enhance the creditworthiness of the issuing entity. However, the
investor must rely on the best efforts of the state to approve the
appropriation. Another type of appropriation-backed obligation is leasebacked debt.

Even though a moral obligation is a form of credit enhancement

provided by a state, it is not a legally enforceable or legally binding

- bligation of the state. Some entities issue debt that carries some form of
public credit enhancement that is legally enforceable. This type of credit
enhancement occurs when the state or a federal agency guarantees or takes

- n an obligation to automatically withhold and deploy state aid to pay any
defaulted debt service by the issuing entity. Typically, the latter form of
public credit enhancement is used for debt obligations of a state's school

systems.

**`Revenue bonds`** The second basic type of security structure is found in a
**revenue bond** . Such bonds are issued for either project or enterprise
financing where the bond issuers pledge to the bondholders the revenues
generated by the operating projects financed. A feasibility study is
performed before the endeavor is undertaken to determine whether it will be
self-supporting.

Examples of revenue bonds include airport revenue bonds, college and

university revenue bonds, hospital revenue bonds, single-family mortgage

revenue bonds, multifamily revenue bonds, public power revenue bonds,

resource recovery revenue bonds, seaport revenue bonds, sports complex

and convention center revenue bonds, student loan revenue bonds, toll road

and gas tax revenue bonds, and water revenue bonds.

**`Hybrid and special bond structures`** Some municipal securities create
special security structures that share characteristics of tax-backed debt and
revenue bonds. They include insured bonds, prerefunded bonds, and
structured/asset-based bonds.

**Insured bonds**, in addition to being secured by the issuer's revenue, are
also backed by insurance policies written by commercial insurance
companies. Insurance on a municipal bond is an agreement by an insurance
company, referred to as a "monoline insurer," to pay the bondholder any
bond principal or coupon interest due on a stated maturity date that is not
paid by the bond issuer. Once issued, this municipal bond insurance usually
extends for the term of the bond issue, and it cannot be canceled by the
insurance company. Municipal bond insurance is just one form of credit
enhancement used by municipal bond issuers, although the most commonly
used form.

Because municipal bond insurance reduces credit risk for the investor,

the marketability of certain municipal securities can be greatly expanded.

Municipal securities that benefit most from the insurance would include

lower-quality bonds; bonds issued by smaller governmental units not

widely known in the financial community; bonds that have a sound, though

complex and difficult-to-understand security structure; and bonds issued by

infrequent local government borrowers who do not have a general market

following among investors. Of course, a major factor for an issuer in

- btaining bond insurance is that its creditworthiness without the insurance
is substantially lower than what it would be with the insurance. That is, the
interest cost savings are only of sufficient magnitude to offset the cost of
the insurance premium when the underlying creditworthiness of the issuer
is lower.

Municipal bond insurance was first introduced in 1971 and until 2008

was a common form of credit enhancement. From 2000 to 2007, more than

half of municipal securities issues were insured bonds or had some other

form of credit enhancement. As a result of the financial crisis that began in

2007 that resulted in substantial payouts for insured mortgage-backed

securities (not municipal securities), the issuance of insured bonds fell

dramatically as the credit ratings of the monoline insurers were

downgraded. For a monoline insurer to insure a municipal bond so that it

receives the highest investment-grade rating, triple A (AAA by S&P and

Fitch; Aaa by Moody's), the insurer must have a triple A rating. Because

they were all downgraded to below triple A, insured municipal securities

ceased. _The Bond Buyer_ reports that in 2005, 57% municipal securities were

insured, but in 2010 and 2011, that figure was only 5.2% and 6.2%,

respectively. [15] In fact, for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011, only 17% of

municipal securities had some form of private credit enhancement. [16]

Although private credit enhancement has declined, public credit

enhancement has increased.

Although originally issued as either revenue or general obligation bonds,

municipals are sometimes prerefunded and are called **prerefunded**

**municipal securities** . (They are also called **refunded bonds** .) A

prerefunding usually occurs when the original bonds are escrowed or

collateralized by direct obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government. A

portfolio of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government is placed in a

trust. The portfolio is assembled so that the cash flows from the securities

match the obligations that the issuer must pay. For example, suppose that a

municipality has a 5% \$100 million issue with 12 years remaining to

maturity. The municipality’s obligation is to make payments of \$2.5 million

every 6 months for the next 12 years and \$100 million 12 years from now.

If the issuer wants to prerefund this issue, it purchases a portfolio of U.S.

government obligations with cash flows of \$2.5 million every 6 months for

the next 12 years and \$100 million 12 years from now.

Once this portfolio of securities whose cash flows match those of the

municipality's obligation is in place, the prerefunded bonds are no longer

secured as either general obligation or revenue bonds. The bonds are now

supported by cash flows from the portfolio or securities held in an escrow

fund. Such bonds, if escrowed with securities guaranteed by the U.S.

government, have little, if any, credit risk. They are the safest municipal

securities available.

The escrow fund for a prerefunded municipal bond can be structured so

that the bonds to be refunded are to be called at the first possible call date or

a subsequent call date established in the original bond indenture. Although

prerefunded bonds are usually retired at their first or subsequent call date,

some are structured to match the debt obligation to the maturity date. Such

bonds are known as .

**escrowed-to-maturity bonds**

Some state and local governments issue bonds where the debt service is

paid from so-called dedicated revenues, such as sales taxes, tobacco

settlement payments, fees, and penalty payments. These structures, referred

to as asset-backed securities, will be discussed in chapter 27. Asset-backed

securities are also referred to as **dedicated revenue bonds** and **structured**

**bonds** _._

```
Municipal Notes

```

Municipal securities issued for periods of up to three years are considered

to be short term in nature. They include tax anticipation notes, revenue

anticipation notes, grant anticipation notes, bond anticipation notes, taxexempt commercial paper, variable-rate demand obligations, and

commercial paper/variable-rate demand obligations.

**Tax anticipation notes** (TANs), **revenue anticipation notes** (RANs),
**grant anticipation notes** (GANs), and **bond anticipation notes** (BANs)
are temporary borrowings by states, local governments, and special
jurisdictions. Usually the notes are issued for a period of 12 months,
although it is not uncommon for notes to be issued for periods as short as
three months or as long as three years. TANs and RANs (also known as
TRANs) are issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes or other
expected revenues. The purpose of these borrowings is to even out irregular
flows into the treasuries of the issuing entity. BANs are issued in
anticipation of the sale of long-term bonds.

We will discuss commercial paper issued by corporations in chapter 25.

**Tax-exempt commercial paper** is used by municipalities to raise funds on

a short-term basis ranging from 1 to 270 days. The dealer sets interest rates

for various maturity dates, and the investor then selects the desired date.

Tax regulations restrict the issuance of tax-exempt commercial paper.

Specifically, tax regulations limit the amount of new issuance of municipal

- bligations that is tax exempt. As a result, every maturity of a tax-exempt
municipal issuance is considered a new debt issuance. Consequently, very
limited issuance of tax-exempt commercial paper exists. Instead, issuers use

- ne of the next two products to raise short-term funds.

**Variable-rate** **demand** **obligations** (VRDOs) are floating-rate

- bligations that have a nominal long-term maturity but have a coupon rate
that is reset either daily or every 7 days. The investor has an option to put
the issue back to the trustee at any time with 7 days' notice. The put price is
par plus accrued interest.

The **commercial paper/VRDO hybrid** is customized to meet the cash

flow needs of an institutional investor. As with tax-exempt commercial

paper, the maturity is flexibly structured, because the remarketing agent

establishes interest rates for a range of maturities. Although the instrument

may have a long nominal maturity, there is a put provision, as with a

VRDO. Put periods can range from one day to more than 360 days. On the

put date, the investor can put back the bonds, receiving principal and

interest, or the investor can elect to extend the maturity at the new interest

rate and put date posted by the remarketing agent at that time. Thus, the

investor has two choices when initially purchasing this instrument: the

interest rate and the put date.

```
Default Risk

```

Investors in municipal securities are exposed to default risk—the risk that

the issuer fails to meet its contractual obligations. Default rates are less than

for corporate bonds of the same maturity and with the same initial credit

rating. For example, a study by Moody's of default rates through 2012

found that the cumulative default rate after 10 years for municipal and

corporate bonds was as follows: [17]

Initial Rating Municipal Securities (%) Corporate Bonds (%)

AAA 0.00 0.50

AA 0.01 0.92

A 0.05 2.48

BBB 0.30 4.74

Moody's also looked at the default rate by the different sectors of the

municipal market from 1970 to 2012. General obligations had lower default

rates than did revenue bonds. The default rate was about 7%. The revenue

bond that had the highest default rate was the housing sector with a default

rate of 40%, followed by the hospital and health care sector with a 30%

default rate.

As will be explained in chapter 26, default rates alone do not indicate a

debt obligation's default risk. Moody's reported that for 1970–2012, the

ultimate recovery for municipal securities averaged about 62%. In the case

- f senior unsecured corporate bonds (which provide a better comparison
than all corporate bonds), the ultimate recovery rate was much lower (49%)
for 1987–2012. The range of recovery rates for municipal securities was
from 2% to 100%.

Spiotto provides a history of municipal bond defaults as well as the

causes and nature of defaults. [18] These include:

    - _Economic conditions:_ Defaults are caused by downturns in the

economy and high interest rates.

    - _Nonessential services:_ Revenue bonds were issued for services that

are no longer needed.

    - _Feasibility of projects and industries:_ Revenue bonds are issued

after a feasibility study for a project is completed. The feasibility study

may have been too optimistic with respect to the demand for the

project or the cost of completing the project.

    - _Fraud:_ Municipal officials fail to comply with the terms of the

relevant documents.

    _Mismanagement:_ A municipality is unable to successfully manage a

project.

    _Unwillingness to pay:_ A municipality may simply be unwilling to

pay (i.e., repudiation of the debt obligation).

    - _Natural disasters:_ The impairment of a municipality’s budget

(reduction in revenue and increase in costs) may be the result of a

natural disaster, such as a hurricane.

Bear in mind that a default does not mean a municipal bankruptcy, nor

does a bankruptcy mean a default. That is, a municipality can default on an

issue but the default may not result in a bankruptcy filing; a municipal

bankruptcy filing may not result in a default of the municipality on its debt.

In fact, historically, very few municipalities that have filed for bankruptcy

have actually defaulted.

```
Factors considered by credit rating agencies when assigning
```

**`ratings`** Many institutional investors in the municipal bond market rely on
their own in-house municipal credit analysts for determining the
creditworthiness of a municipal issue; other investors rely on the CRAs.
The assigned rating system is the same as that used for corporate bonds that
we will discuss in chapter 26. The credit rating for the central government
acts as a ceiling for the rating on the credit rating of its subnationals.
Although it is not unprecedented, it is rare to see a subnational with a higher
rating than its sovereign.

To evaluate general obligation bonds, the CRAs assess information in

four basic categories. The first category includes information on the issuer's

debt structure and overall debt burden. The second category relates to the

issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy.

The focus of attention here usually is on the issuer's general operating funds

and whether it has maintained balanced budgets over three to five years.

The third category involves determining the specific local taxes and

intergovernmental revenues available to the issuer, as well as obtaining

historical information both on tax collection rates (which are important

when looking at property tax levies) and the dependence of local budgets on

specific revenue sources. The fourth and last category of information

necessary for the credit analysis is an assessment of the issuer's overall

socioeconomic environment. The determinants for this category include

trends in local employment distribution and composition, population

growth, real estate property valuation, and personal income, among other

economic factors.

Although numerous security structures can be used for revenue bonds,

the underlying principle for rating is whether the project being financed will

generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the obligation due bondholders.

**`Municipal bankruptcy`** We have referred to municipal bankruptcy. The
provision in the U.S. bankruptcy code dealing with bankruptcy protection
for municipalities is Chapter 9. This provision is much like a Chapter 11
bankruptcy in that it provides for a reorganization plan. There is no
equivalent for municipalities of what is provided for in a Chapter 7
bankruptcy filing, which pertains to the liquidation of a corporation. This is
because a municipality cannot be liquidated, because that would violate the
Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution granting states sovereignty over
their internal affairs. [19] Effectively, Chapter 9 grants a municipality more
power over its creditors than a corporation has over its creditors. A
municipality's creditors cannot compel a municipality to liquidate its assets.

States are not permitted to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Hence only

nonstate municipal entities (cities, counties, townships, school districts,

public improvement districts, and authorities of revenue-producing entities)

can file. This action is not a simple process, explaining why historically the

number of municipal entities filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection is

low. For example, according to data from the American Bankruptcy

Institute, [20] for the period 1980 through the second quarter of 2011, there

were only 159 filings. Chapter 11 bankruptcies for any single year are far

greater than that.

Municipality entities must overcome a major obstacle to file for

bankruptcy. Title 11 of Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code requires that the

state in which the municipal is located must grant approval to that entity to

file for bankruptcy protection. This allows individual states to assess the

trade-off of the adverse economic impact of the municipal entity seeking to

- btain bankruptcy protection against the needs of the municipality entities
that need protection offered by a Chapter 9 filing. Twenty-two states do not

allow municipal entities access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy, 16 states impose

conditions that must be satisfied by a municipality to file, and the remaining

12 states provide blanket authorization to file. [21]

Because of the Tenth Amendment, a U.S. bankruptcy judge does not

have the same power in a municipal bankruptcy as in a corporate

bankruptcy. As a result, a U.S. bankruptcy judge is not as active in Chapter

9 bankruptcy filings as he or she is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After

determination of whether a municipal entity is entitled by state law to file

for bankruptcy, a bankruptcy judge is responsible for approving the plan for

how the municipal entity is going to pay its creditors and ensuring that the

municipal entity executes that plan.

As of 2017, the four largest municipal Chapter 9 bankruptcies are:

   - City of Detroit, Michigan, filed in 2013 due to its inability to satisfy
unfunded pension obligations: \$18 billion.

   - Jefferson City, Alabama, filed in 2011 because of a failed investment
strategy (bets on interest rate) leading to losses: \$4 billion.

   - Orange County, California, filed in 1994 due to losses of more than
\$1 billion on leveraged investments in exotic mortgage-backed
security products: \$2 billion.

   - Stockton, California, filed in 2012 due to difficulties satisfying
pension obligations: \$1 billion.

```
Secondary Market for Municipal Bonds

```

Municipal securities are traded in the OTC market supported by more than

1,500 municipal bond dealers. Markets for the debts of smaller issuers

(referred to as **local credits** ) are maintained by regional brokerage firms,

local banks, and some of the larger Wall Street firms. Markets for the bonds

- f larger issuers (referred to as **generic names** ) are supported by the larger
brokerage firms and banks, many of whom have investment banking
relationships with these issuers.

In the municipal bond market, an "odd lot" of bonds is \$25,000 or less in

par value for retail investors. For institutions, anything below \$100,000 in

par value is considered an odd lot. Dealer spreads depend on several

factors. For the retail investor, the spread can range from as low as 0.25

points ($12.50 per $5,000 par value) on large blocks of actively traded

bonds to four points ($200 per $5,000 of par value) for odd-lot sales of an

inactive issue. For institutional investors, the dealer spread rarely exceeds

0.5 points ($25 per $5,000 of par value). The convention for both corporate

and Treasury bonds is to quote prices as a percentage of par value with 100

equal to par. However, municipal securities generally are traded and quoted

in terms of yield (yield to maturity or yield to call). The price of the bond in

this case is called a "basis price." The exception is certain long-maturity

revenue bonds. A bond traded and quoted in dollar prices (actually, as a

**dollar bond** .
percentage of par value) is called a

As noted earlier, more than 75% of the outstanding principal amount of

municipal securities is held directly or indirectly by retail (individual

investors). Historically, the market has been viewed as one where investors

tended to buy a municipal security and then hold it to maturity. Thus, after

the initial sale of a municipal security, there is infrequent trading. However,

a significant volume of secondary market trading does occur. According to

trade data compiled by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board

(MSRB), annual trading in municipal securities for the years 2010–2013

averaged \$3.4 trillion in principal value; the average number of trades per

year over the same period averaged 10.3 million. [22] The number of trades for

revenue bonds during those years was approximately double the number for

general obligation bonds. For the three years ending 2013, trading in taxexempt bonds was almost 10 times greater than taxable bonds in terms of

the number of trades.

Investors typically have limited access to pretrade information.

Generally, municipal bond dealers do not make available firm bid and ask

quotations available to the public. Pretrade information might be available

to investors from alternative trading systems, such as electronic

communication networks made available to municipal bond dealers. Trades

are typically executed for customers on a principal basis (i.e., the municipal

bond dealer buys and sells from its own inventory). For customer trades not

executed in that way, the dealer will either search the OTC market to

execute the trade or use an alternative trading system. In general,

particularly for retail investors, the cost of transacting is higher than in other

investment-grade bond markets due to the lack of market transparency.

Roughly 43% of the trading in the municipal securities in 2012 and 2013

was executed through five bond dealers, according to data compiled by the

MSRB. [23] Roughly two-thirds of all trades were executed by 20 bond

dealers.

The SEC study of the municipal securities market made several

recommendations for improving the secondary market and providing

greater investor protection. The two major areas where improvements have

been suggested are ongoing disclosure and improving market structure.

```
Yields on Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds

```

Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal securities, their yield is less

than that on Treasuries with the same maturity. The difference in yield

between tax-exempt securities and Treasury securities is typically measured

not in basis points but in percentage terms. More specifically, it is measured

as the percentage of the yield on a municipal security relative to a

comparable Treasury security and is called the **yield ratio** . Historically, the

yield ratio has varied not just by credit rating and maturity but over time.

The range for the yield ratio has been from 0.80 to more than 1.0.

In the municipal bond market, several benchmark curves exist. In

general, a benchmark yield curve is constructed for AAA-rated state general

- bligations. In the Treasury and corporate bond markets, it is not unusual to
find at different times shapes for the yield curve described in chapter 16
(see figure 16.1). In general, the municipal yield curve is positively sloped.

Participants in the municipal securities market calculate a yield to

approximate what yield would have to be earned on a taxable bond to net

the same yield after taxes as buying a taxable bond. That yield is referred to

as a taxable-equivalent yield. We described this yield measure and its

calculation in chapter 16.

```
Chinese Municipal Bond Market

```

The People's Republic of China is making a major push to create a

sustainable municipal debt market that has relied on banks to provide

infrastructure finance to bond issuance. For example, in 2011, three cities

(Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen) and the province of Zhejiang were allowed

to issue bonds directly to the capital markets. These bonds are issued

without a sovereign guarantee. On September 1, 2014, the Chinese

parliament passed changes in the budget law that allows local governments

to issue bonds directly. Local governments may issue bonds to fund projects

that promote the public good (investments in infrastructure) but may not use

borrowed money for day-to-day operations. In recent years, the Chinese

government has made a major push to develop the country's municipal debt

market. Prior to 2010, subnational government entities borrowed through

the Urban Development and Investment Corporation, which is the

investment and financing platform for subnationals in China. This

corporation borrows directly from financial markets, and the subnational is

responsible for servicing the debt.

Another important financing vehicle that has been used in China since

the global financial crisis is the "local government-backed unit." These

units are used to fund infrastructure projects. A local government-backed

unit is a state-owned enterprise with a local government as the only

shareholder. To create a unit, the local government transfers land, utilities,

- r infrastructure to the unit in exchange for equity ownership. Just like
regular corporations, the local government-backed unit raises capital from
bank loans or the sale of debt instruments. Local governments service the
debt through the sale of land. They are not permitted to use tax revenue to
fund the debt. [24]

```
Key Points

```

- Subnational governments include states, regions, provinces, counties,
municipalities, as well as local utilities companies either owned or regulated
by these entities.

  - To obtain the necessary funding to operate a subnational
government, revenue sources of funding are combined with some debt
arrangement (bank borrowing or the issuance of bonds).

   - A major issue faced by subnationals in developing and developed
countries is how to obtain debt funding for large-scale investments in

infrastructure.

- Although some financing for infrastructure comes from central
governments and multilateral financial institutions, the rest must come
from the subnationals themselves and any debt funding that they can

- btain; for this reason, central governments are seeking to strengthen
the debt market for their subnationals.

- Central governments have two models from which to develop their
subnational debt markets: bank lending and bond issuance.

- Bank lending is via municipal banks that have been established in a

country.

- The development of the municipal bond market in any country
requires the introduction of credit ratings by credit rating agencies.

- For small subnationals that are infrequent issuers of bonds, issuance
is made possible through municipal bond banks.

- Multilateral financial institutions work with developing countries
when seeking to create a sustainable municipal debt market.

- The substantial need for financing throughout the world for
infrastructure projects and the constraints on the budgets of
subnationals have resulted in some countries turning to the private
sector via public-private partnerships and project finance initiatives.

- Funding arrangements via public-private partnerships and project
finance initiatives are attractive to subnationals, because they typically
do not appear as part of a subnational's budget.

- Green bonds are bonds whose proceeds are restricted to fund green
projects, which are projects that promote climate or other
environmental sustainability goals.

- In the United States, municipal bonds are issued by state and local
governments and their authorities.

- Although there are both tax-exempt and taxable municipal bonds in
the United States, most municipal securities are of the tax-exempt
variety.

- The interest received from a tax-exempt municipal security is
exempt from federal income taxation.

- Investors in municipal securities attracted by their tax advantage are
retail investors, collective investment vehicles, and property and
casualty insurance companies.

- Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal securities, the yield
- n tax-exempt municipal securities is less than that on Treasuries with
the same maturity.

- The yield ratio measures the yield on a municipal security relative to
a comparable Treasury security.

- The two basic types of municipal bond structures are tax-backed
debt and revenue bonds.

- Tax-backed debt obligations are instruments issued by states,
counties, special districts, cities, towns, and school districts that are
secured by some form of tax revenue.

- Tax-backed debt includes general obligation debt (the broadest type
- f tax-backed debt), appropriation-backed obligations, and debt
- bligations supported by public credit enhancement programs.
- A general obligation bond is said to be double-barreled when it is
secured not only by the issuer's general taxing powers to create
revenues accumulated in a general fund but also by certain identified
fees, grants, and special charges, which provide additional revenues
from outside the general fund.

- Revenue bonds are issued for enterprise financings secured by the
revenues generated by the completed projects themselves, or for
general public-purpose financings in which the issuers pledge to the
bondholders the tax and revenue resources that were previously part of
the general fund.

- Prerefunded bonds are no longer secured as either general obligation
- r revenue bonds but are supported by a portfolio of securities held in
an escrow fund. If escrowed with securities guaranteed by the U.S.
government, prerefunded bonds are the safest municipal securities
available.

- A prerefunded municipal bond is one in which the escrow fund is
structured so that the bonds are to be called at the first possible call

date or a subsequent call date established in the original bond

indenture.

   - Municipal securities structured as asset-backed securities are backed
by "dedicated" revenues, such as sales taxes and tobacco settlement

payments.

   - Municipal notes are issued for shorter periods (one to three years)
than are municipal securities.

   - Investing in municipal securities exposes investors to credit risk and
tax risk.

   - Default rates are lower and recovery rates are higher for municipal
securities compared to otherwise comparable corporate bonds.

   - Historically, the causes and nature of defaults have been economic
conditions, nonessential services, feasibility of projects and industries,
fraud, mismanagement, unwillingness to pay, and natural disasters.

   - To evaluate general obligation bonds, the credit rating agencies
assess information in four basic categories: (1) issuer's debt structure
and overall debt burden, (2) issuer's ability and political discipline to
maintain sound budgetary policy, (3) issuer's access to specific local
taxes and intergovernmental revenues, and (4) issuer's overall
socioeconomic environment.

   - The provision in the U.S. bankruptcy code dealing with bankruptcy
protection for municipalities is Chapter 9 and provides for a
reorganization plan.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the evolution of the stock market;
   - how the stock market has become institutionalized;
   - electronic trading of stocks;
   - regulation of the stock market;
   - order-driven markets versus quote-driven markets;
   - the venues where stocks are traded in the United States;
   - the different types of alternative trading systems;
   - why investors use alternative trading systems;
   - how orders are executed in the market by brokers;
   - the historical background for the current regulatory framework;
   - who the federal regulators of the equity market are;
   - the federal regulations dealing with market volatility (trading limits
and circuit breakers), short selling, and insider trading; and

   - what global depository receipts and euro equities are.

Equity securities represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Holders

- f equity securities are entitled to the earnings of the corporation when
those earnings are distributed in the form of dividends. They are also
entitled to a pro rata share of the remaining equity if a corporation is
liquidated. The two types of equity securities are common stock and
preferred stock. The key distinction between these two forms of equity
securities lies in the degree to which they may participate in any
distribution of earnings and capital and the priority given to each in the
distribution of earnings. Typically, preferred stockholders are entitled to a

fixed dividend, which they receive before common stockholders may

receive dividends, and they also have priority over common stockholders in

a claim on assets in a liquidation. We therefore refer to preferred stock as a

.

_senior corporate security_

In the secondary market for common stock, the opinions of investors

about the economic prospect of a company are expressed through the trades

they execute. Taken together, these trades establish the market consensus

- pinion about the price of the stock. In turn, the company's estimated cost
- f common stock is determined.

In this chapter and the two that follow, we cover the world's equity

markets. In this chapter, our focus is on the venues for the secondary trading

- f equities in the United States. In chapter 23, we describe trading
arrangements in the U.S. secondary market, explain the costs of transacting,
and review the pricing efficiency of the equities market, along with its
implications for equity strategies. In chapter 24, we examine global nonU.S. equity markets.

```
Evolution of Stock Markets and Their Institutionalization

```

Stocks throughout the world have traditionally been transacted or traded on

venues, or exchanges (bourses), which are physical locations. The nature of

stock exchanges, however, has changed considerably since 1980. Table 22.1

summarizes these major changes. (Many of the terms and entities listed in

the table are described in this and later chapters.) The table shows the

evolution of stock exchanges from a market that was characterized as single

country, limited product, mutually owned, floor trading exchanges to

international, multiproduct, publicly owned, electronic trading exchanges.

Four general interacting factors contributed to significant changes

experienced by the equity markets throughout the world over the past 40

years:

1. institutionalization of the stock market as a result of a shift away
from traditional small individual investors to large institutional
investors;

2. change in trading from mutual member-owned floor trading
exchanges to publicly owned computer-based trading exchanges
together with automated trading systems;

3. automation of settlement systems; and
4. changes in government regulation of the market.

The institutionalization of the common stock market has important

implications for the design of equity trading systems, because the demands

made by institutional investors differ from those made by traditional small

investors. Moreover, the role of the equity market in facilitating capital

formation for public corporations means designing a market structure that

considers not just large corporations but also small corporations and startup

companies seeking to raise equity capital, a market sector that we describe

in chapter 28.

The nature of equity trading is currently dominated by the use of

computers to generate orders as a result of advances in computer

technology, through what is referred to as _algorithmic trading_ . Because of

this dominance of computer trading, the equity market has been referred to

as an

_algorithmic marketplace_, in contradistinction to how equity markets

previously operated, which is called a _manual market_ . [1] These topics are

discussed throughout this chapter.

```
Electronic Trading

```

Traditionally, equities have been traded globally on "exchanges," which are

physical locations at which individual traders conduct transactions with one

another. The nature of exchanges has changed considerably over the past

few decades in the United States, as summarized in table 22.1. Globally,

exchanges have followed similar trends. The current overall approach to

equity trading, as summarized in figure 22.1, consists of a combination of

exchange trading venues and off-exchange trading systems (called

"alternative trading systems" (ATS)) of equities. Consider a recent advance

.

in trading, called **electronic trading**

```
Figure 22.1

```

Structure of U.S. stock markets.

Electronic trading is a method of trading securities whereby traders are

brought together via electronic trading platforms or networks that create a

"virtual marketplace," rather than via a physical trading floor. Electronic

trading has to a large extent replaced "floor trading" and telephone trading,

as discussed below, wherein traders are brought together physically on a

trading floor or by telephone contact, respectively.

Now let us consider U.S. trading venues. Floor trading was used

exclusively until recently by the major stock exchange, the New York Stock

Exchange (NYSE) described later in this chapter, and is now used only for a

small portion of its trading. Nasdaq was formed in 1971 as the world's first

electronic stock market.

Electronic trading provides several advantages over floor trading:

    - _Lower transaction costs_ : Automating the entire process (including

trade processing, position keeping, clearing and settlement, referred to

as "straight-through processing") has further reduced costs.

    _Increased transparency:_ It is easier to track prices that are

maintained in an electronic system.

    _Increased liquidity_ : By more efficiently connecting all buyers and

sellers, the market becomes more liquid.

    - _Smaller spreads_ : Automation has lowered costs, increased

transparency, and increased liquidity, which results in smaller spreads.

    - .

_Expanded trading hours_

Later we will discuss trading venues in the United States. Of these

trading venues, both the NYSE and Nasdaq use electronic trading. The

NYSE is an auction market (discussed below), which has a specialist

assigned to each stock, although independent floor traders do most of the

trades. In addition, NYSE has an electronic Super Designated Order

Turnaround system (SuperDOT system) for "small" trades of less than

100,000 shares (with priority given to trades of less than 2,100 shares) and

transmits the orders (both market and limit) directly to the specialist for this

stock. This system provides more efficient transactions, because the orders

go directly to the specialist rather than to a floor trader and then to manually

transaction. Executed orders are also reported to the broker through the

SuperDOT system. The DOT and SuperDOT systems began in 1976.

NYSE's recent Arca market, which is discussed below, is completely

electronic.

```
Regulation of U.S. Equity Markets

```

The regulation of the securities markets around the globe, including stock

exchanges, has three primary objectives: (1) to protect investors, (2) to

ensure the smooth functioning of the market, and (3) to reduce systemic

risk.

To protect investors, regulation must address informational asymmetries

between the issuers of securities and investors. This can be achieved

through disclosure regulation. The equities markets in most countries are

highly regulated to ensure that investors are protected against fraudulent

practices that might be followed by corporations when issuing stock or by

brokers and dealers when executing transaction orders by investors. The

smooth functioning of the market requires trading and settlement rules to

minimize the risk of market disruptions. Systemic risk has been discussed

in chapter 10 and touched on in several other chapters in this book.

```
U.S. Regulatory System

```

In the United States, there are three types of regulations: federal regulation

by the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulation by a self-regulatory

- rganization (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), and regulation
by state regulators. Here we briefly describe each type.

**`Securities and Exchange Commission`** The primary regulator of U.S.
securities markets is the **Securities and Exchange Commission** (SEC),
created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Two
important pieces of legislation were passed by Congress following the stock
market crash of October 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. The
first was the Securities Act of 1933, which required that investors receive
financial information—in the form of a "prospectus"—before going public
(the primary market for securities). The second was the Securities Act of
1934, which created the SEC, whose goal was to protect investors and
maintain the fair and orderly functioning of the securities markets. Among
the SEC's responsibilities are to promote full public disclosure and to
protect investors from fraudulent and manipulative markets. Briefly, the
Securities Act of 1933 covered the primary markets, and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 covered the secondary markets for U.S. securities.

The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange

Act of 1934 was to restore the confidence of investors in the stock market.

The two ways that Congress sought to do so were by specifying: (1) the

information (as well as the timing of that information) that companies

- ffering securities to the public must furnish to investors (the primary
markets); and (2) the practices that brokers, dealers, and trading venues
must follow when executing orders on behalf of investors (the secondary
markets).

The five general areas where the SEC has responsibility are:

  - interpreting and enforcing federal securities laws passed by
Congress;

   - issuing new rules and amending of existing rules;
  - overseeing and monitoring the major players in the securities
markets (i.e., securities firms, brokers, investment advisers, and ratings
agencies);

   - overseeing private self-regulatory organizations in the securities,
accounting, and auditing fields; and

   - coordinating U.S. securities regulation with other federal entities
(e.g., Congress, the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal
Reserve), state regulators, and foreign authorities.

To carry out its responsibilities, the SEC relies on its five divisions:

    _Division of Corporation Finance:_ Executing the SEC’s duty for

   - verseeing corporate disclosure of important information to investors
when securities are publicly offered is this division's responsibility.

    _Division of Trading and Markets:_ This division is responsible for

executing the SEC's duty to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient

markets.

    _Division of Investment Management:_ The responsibility of this

division is to provide investor protection and promote capital

formation by using its oversight and regulatory authority over the

investment management industry.

    _Division of Enforcement:_ This division is responsible for law

enforcement function by recommending investigations of securities

law violations, recommending the SEC bring civil actions in federal

court or an administrative proceeding before an administrative law

judge, and prosecuting these cases.

    _Division of Economic and Risk Analysis:_ This division provides

sophisticated and data-driven economic and risk analyses to inform the

SEC in its policymaking, rulemaking, enforcement, and examinations.

**`Financial Industry Regulatory Authority`** The Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is an independent, not-for-profit

- rganization authorized by Congress with a dual mission objective: to
protect investors and to foster market integrity. FINRA is referred to as a
self-regulatory organization. Created in 2007 when the National
Association of Securities Dealers merged with the regulatory functions of
the NYSE, FINRA writes and enforces rules governing the activities of

securities firms, examines securities firms for compliance with those rules,

and fosters market transparency.

To accomplish its dual mission, FINRA does the following: [2]

1. _Deters misconduct by enforcing the rules._ To safeguard investors
against fraud and bad practices, FINRA writes and enforces rules and
regulations for all U.S. brokerage firms and brokers, and it examines
broker-dealers for compliance with its own rules and also with federal
securities laws and rules. FINRA licenses all brokers. FINRA financial

examiners perform on-site examinations to assess how brokerage firms

are operating, focusing on major risks to the markets and investors.

2. _Disciplines those who break the rules._ If brokers fail to comply
with the rules, FINRA may impose a fine or penalty, suspend a
violator from the industry for a specified period of time, or bar a
violator from the industry.

3. _Detects and prevents wrongdoing._ FINRA monitors trades in the
U.S. listed equity market (about six billion shares traded) using datagathering and analysis technology that has the capability of detecting
potential abuses.

4. _Educates and informs investors._ The FINRA website provides
investors with tools and resources that can aid them when making
investment decisions.

5. _Resolves securities disputes._ Through arbitration and mediation,
FINRA resolves securities-related disputes that arise between investors
and securities firms or individual brokers.

**`State regulation`** In addition to federal securities laws, there are state
securities laws. The focus of state laws, referred to as "blue sky laws," is on
the issuance of securities and periodic disclosure, as opposed to market
regulation. Each state has a regulatory agency responsible for regulating the
sale of securities in the state. Every state is a member of the North
American Securities Administrators Association, which, although lacking
the authority to enforce laws, formulates and recommends model securities
laws. What most states use as the basis for their securities laws is the

Uniform Securities Act of 1956. Because this act is written broadly, and

because the laws may vary from state to state, state securities laws will not

be discussed here.

```
Stock Trading Market Structures

```

An _exchange_ is often defined as a market where intermediaries meet to

deliver and execute customer orders. This description, however, also applies

to many dealer networks. In the United States, an exchange is an institution

that performs this function and is registered with the SEC as an exchange.

Some off-exchange markets also perform this function.

There are two overall market models for trading stocks. The first model

is order driven, in which buy and sell orders of those public participants

who are the holders of the securities establish the prices at which other

public participants can trade. These orders can be either market orders or

limit orders, which we describe in chapter 23. The second model is quote

driven, in which intermediaries (i.e., market makers or dealers) quote the

prices at which the public participants trade. Market makers provide a bid

quote (to buy) and an offer quote (to sell), and they realize revenues from

the spread between these quotes. Thus, market makers derive a profit from

the spread and the turnover of their stocks.

```
Order-Driven Markets

```

Participants in a **pure order-driven market** are referred to as "naturals"

(the natural buyers and sellers). No intermediary participates as a trader in a

pure order-driven market. Instead, the investors supply the liquidity

themselves. That is, the **natural buyers** are the source of liquidity for the

**natural sellers**, and vice versa. The naturals can be either buyers or sellers,

each using market or limit orders.

**Order-driven markets** can be structured in two different ways: as a
continuous market or as a call auction at a specific point of time. In a
**continuous market**, a trade can be made at any moment in continuous time
during which a buy order and a sell order meet at a specific time. In this
case, trading is a series of bilateral matches. In the **call auction**, orders are
batched together for a simultaneous execution in a multilateral trade at a

specific point in time. All buy orders at this price and higher and all sell

- rders at this price and lower are executed.

Continuous trading is better for customers who need immediacy.

However, for markets with very low trading volume, an intraday call may

focus liquidity at one (or a few) times of the day and permit the trades to

- ccur. In addition, very large orders—block trades—may be facilitated by
the feasibility of continuous trading.

Nonintermediated markets involve only naturals; that is, such markets

do not require a third party. However, a market may not have sufficient

liquidity to function without the participation of intermediaries, who are

third parties in addition to the natural buyers and sellers. This leads to the

need for intermediaries and quote-driven markets.

```
Quote-Driven Markets

```

**Quote-driven markets** permit intermediaries to provide liquidity.

**brokers** **dealers**          - r
Intermediaries may be (who are agents for the naturals);
**market makers** (who are principals in the trade); or **specialists**, as on the
NYSE (who act as both agents and principals). Dealers are independent,
profit-making participants in the process. Dealers operate as principals, not
agents. Dealers continually provide bid and offer quotes to buy for or sell
from their own accounts and profit from the spread between their bid and

- ffer quotes.

Dealers compete with one another in their bids and offers. Obviously,

from the customer's perspective, the "best" market is the highest bid and

lowest offer among the dealers. This highest bid/lowest offer combination is

referred to as the "inside market" or the "top of the book." For example,

assume that dealers A, B, and C have the bids and offers (also called **asking**

table 22.2.

**prices** ) for hypothetical stock Alpha as shown in

```
Table 22.2

by dealer C of \$41.00. Thus, the inside market is the \$40.50 bid (by A) and

\$41.00 offer (by C). Note that A's spread is \$40.50 bid and \$41.20 offer for

a spread (or profit margin) of \$0.70. A has the highest bid but not the lowest

- ffer. C has the lowest offer but not the highest bid. B has neither the
highest bid nor the lowest offer. For a stock in the U.S. market, the highest
bid and lowest offer across all markets is called the **national best bid and**

**offer** (NBBO).

Dealers add value to the transaction process by providing capital for

trading and facilitating order handling. With respect to providing capital for

trading, they buy and sell for their own accounts at their bid and offer

prices, respectively, thereby providing liquidity. With respect to order

handling, they provide value in two ways. First, they assist in the price

improvement of customer orders; that is, the order is executed within the

bid/offer spread. Second, they facilitate the market timing of customer

- rders to achieve price discovery. Price discovery is a dynamic process that
involves customer orders being translated into trades and transaction prices.
Because price discovery is not instantaneous, individual participants have
an incentive to "market-time" the placement of their orders. Intermediaries
may understand the order flow and may assist the customer in this regard.
The intermediary may be a person or an electronic system.

The over-the-counter (OTC) markets are quote-driven markets. The

OTC markets began during a time when stock quotes were passed over the

counter. A customer may choose to buy from or sell to a specific market

maker to whom they wish to direct an order. Directing an order to a specific

market is referred to as "preferencing."

```
Order-Driven versus Quote-Driven Markets

```

Overall, nonintermediated, order-driven markets may be less costly due to

the absence of profit-seeking dealers. But the markets for many stocks are

not inherently sufficiently liquid to operate in this way. For this reason,

intermediated, dealer markets are often necessary for inherently less liquid

markets. The dealers provide dealer capital, participate in price discovery,

and facilitate market timing.

Because of the different advantages of these two approaches, many

equity markets are now **hybrid markets** . For example, the NYSE is

primarily a continuous auction order-driven system based on customer

- rders, but the specialists enhance the liquidity by their market making to
maintain a fair and orderly market, and market makers also enhance
liquidity. Overall, the NYSE is primarily an auction, order-driven market
that has specialists (who often engage in market making), other floor
traders, call markets at the open and close, and upstairs dealers who provide
proprietary capital to facilitate block transactions. Thus, the NYSE is a
hybrid combination of these two models. Another hybrid aspect of the
NYSE is that it opens and closes trading with a call auction. The continuous
market and call auction market are combined. Thus, the NYSE is a
continuous market during the trading day and a call auction market to open
and close the market and to reopen after a stop in trading.

Nasdaq, which we describe later in this chapter, began as a descendent

- f the OTC dealer network and is a dealer quote-driven market. It remains
primarily a quote-driven market but has added some order-driven aspects,
such as its limit order book, called SuperMontage, which made it a hybrid
market.

Figure 22.1 provides an overview of the non-intermediated, auction,

- rder-driven markets and the intermediated, dealer, quote-driven markets in
the United States.

Another structural change that has occurred in exchanges is their

evolution from membership-owned, floor-traded organizations to publicly

- wned, electronically traded (that is, no trading floor) organizations. The
nature of this evolution (or revolution) was discussed earlier.

```
U.S. Equity Trading Venues

```

Broadly speaking, equity trading in the United States occurs mainly through

either: (1) national securities exchanges or (2) alternative trading systems.

These methods are summarized in figure 22.2. Under the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, a securities exchange must be registered with the

SEC under Section 6 of the Act. An **alternative trading system** (ATS),

also referred to as an **off-exchange trading venue**, involves the trading of

stocks off an exchange which are listed on an exchange, or for the trading

- f stocks in the after-hours market (when the national exchanges are
closed). Under U.S. securities law, an ATS is given the option to register as
a registered exchange or as a broker-dealer. [3] For this reason, an ATS can
also be classified as a registered securities exchange if it elects to register
with the SEC as such.

```
Figure 22.2

```

U.S. equity trading venues.

In the United States, there are 14 SEC registered securities that trade

equities. As explained below, some of the SEC registered exchanges are in

fact ATSs that elected to be registered and regulated as national securities

exchanges.

When discussing the different types of venues for trading, it is useful to

think of the classification of traded stocks in terms of their listing on an

exchange. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines two categories of

traded stocks. The first is exchange-traded stocks, also called "listed"

stocks. The second is what is called OTC stocks, or non-exchange-traded

stocks and thus, by inference, "unlisted." We will therefore refer to nonATS venues as exchanges for trading listed stocks or exchanges for trading

unlisted stocks. There is some overlap (and ambiguity) in the use of trading

- f listed and OTC stocks and the trading of these on exchanges and ATS.
Although this is helpful for classifying non-ATS exchanges, it should be
pointed out that there are requirements for stocks to be traded on exchanges
for unlisted stocks.

Information provided by trading venues is important for market

transparency. **Pre-trade transparency** is the disclosure by the trading

venue of a stock's supply and demand as measured in terms of bid-ask

prices. That information, provided in what is called the **order book**,

indicates the liquidity and depth of the market for that stock. **Post-trade**

**transparency** is the disclosure of trades that have been executed on the

trading venue.

Transparency is provided by reporting on the Consolidated Quote

System and Consolidated Tape System (CTS). Pre-trade transparency is

provided by the display of the stock's national best bid and offer (NBBO)

- n the Consolidated Quote System. The CTS provides post-trade
transparency by providing post-trade data, which include the transaction
prices and the quantities traded. These topics are considered further below.

```
Exchange Markets for Listed Stocks

```

Traditionally, exchange markets have been physical locations that are

populated by "members" that use the exchange facilities and systems to

exchange or trade listed stocks. Stocks traded on an exchange are said to be

listed stocks. To be listed, a company must apply and satisfy requirements

established by the exchange for minimum capitalization, shareholder equity,

average closing share price, and other criteria. Even after being listed,

exchanges may delist a company's stock if it no longer meets the exchange

requirements.

Some stocks are traded on regional as well as national stock exchanges.

Two kinds of stocks are listed on a regional stock exchange: (1) stocks of

companies that either could not qualify for listing on one of the major

national exchanges or could qualify for listing but chose not to list there;

and (2) stocks, known as **dually listed stocks**, that are also listed on a major

national exchange. A company may be motivated to dual list, for example,

if a local brokerage firm that purchases a membership on a regional

exchange can trade the company's listed stocks without having to purchase

a considerably more expensive membership on the national stock exchange

where the stock is also listed. Alternatively, a local brokerage firm could

use the services of a member of a major national stock exchange to execute

an order, but it then gives up part of its commission. The regional stock

exchanges compete with the major national exchanges for the execution of

smaller trades. Major national brokerage firms route such orders to regional

exchanges because of the lower cost they charge for executing orders or

better prices.

**`New York Stock Exchange`** The major exchange that trades its own listed
stocks is the traditional NYSE. A more recent electronic version of the

NYSE stock exchange, NYSE Arca, is discussed below. Members trade

stocks listed on the traditional NYSE in a centralized continuous auction

market at a designated location on the trading floor, called a "post," with

brokers representing their customers' buy and sell orders. A single

specialist is the market maker for each stock. A member firm may be

designated as a specialist for the common stock of more than one company,

that is, several stocks can trade at the same post. But only one specialist is

designated for the common stock of each listed company.

Prior to 2006, the NYSE was a pure continuous-order market. [4] Such a

market is also called a "continuous market" or "continuous auction market."

In this type of order-driven market, prices are determined continuously

throughout the trading day as buyers and sellers submit orders. The other

type of market structure is the order-driven market, characterized by a

periodic call auction, or an auction market, in which orders are batched or

grouped together for simultaneous execution at preannounced times. Today,

the NYSE uses both types of market structures, continuous auction and call

auction. More specifically, the NYSE is a continuous auction market during

the trading day and a call auction market to open and close the market (as

well as to restart trading if a stock has stopped trading). Hence the NYSE

can be described as a hybrid market.

A specialist for each stock stands at a trading position around one of the

NYSE posts. Each post is essentially an auction site where orders, bids, and

- ffers arrive. In addition to the single specialist market maker on an
exchange, member firms of an exchange can trade for themselves or on
behalf of their customers. NYSE member firms, which are broker-dealer

- rganizations that serve the investing public, employ brokers on the trading
floor who serve as fiduciaries in the execution of customer orders.

Specialists are required to conduct the auction process and maintain an

- rderly market in one or more designated stocks. Specialists may act as
both a broker (agent) and a dealer (principal). In their role as a broker, or
agent, specialists transact customer orders in their assigned stocks, which
arrive at their post electronically or are entrusted to them by a floor broker
to be executed if and when a stock reaches a price specified by a customer
(i.e., a limit or stop order, as discussed in chapter 23). As a dealer or
principal, specialists buy and sell shares in their assigned stocks for their

- wn account as necessary to maintain an orderly market. Specialists must
always give precedence to public orders over trading for their own account.

Certain types of orders not immediately executed on the trading floor are

known as limit orders and stop orders (which are discussed in chapter 23).

If the order is a limit or stop order, the member firm's floor broker can wait

in the trading crowd or give the order to the specialist in the stock, who

enters the order in that specialist's limit order book (or simply the "book")

for later execution based on the relationship between the market price and

the price specified in the limit or stop order. The book lists the limit and

stop orders, arranged by size and nearness to the current market price. The

book used to be an actual physical paper book but is now maintained

electronically. Traders can see the total limit-order volume at every bid and

- ffer price, allowing for market transparency.

NYSE-assigned specialists have four major roles:

1. As dealers, they trade for their own accounts in any temporary
absence of public buyers or sellers, and only after executing all public

   - rders in their possession at the specified price;

2. As agents, they execute market orders entrusted to them by brokers,
as well as orders awaiting a specific market price;

3. As catalysts, they help bring buyers and sellers together; and
4. As auctioneers, they quote current bid-ask prices that reflect total
supply and demand for each of the stocks assigned to them.

When carrying out their duties, specialists may act as either an agent or a

principal. When acting as an agent, the specialist simply fills customer

market orders or limit or stop orders (either new orders or orders from the

limit order book) by opposite orders (buy or sell). When acting as a

principal, the specialist assumes responsibility for maintaining a fair and

- rderly market. Regulations prohibit specialists from engaging in
transactions in securities unless such transactions are necessary to maintain
a fair and orderly market. Specialists profit only from those trades in which
they are involved; that is, they realize no revenue for trades in which they

act as agent.

The term **fair and orderly market** means that a market is characterized

by price continuity and reasonable depth. Thus, specialists are required to

maintain a reasonable spread between bids and offers and small changes in

price between transactions. Specialists are expected to bid and offer for

their own account if necessary to promote such a fair and orderly market.

They cannot put their own interests ahead of public orders and are obliged

to trade on their own account against the market trend to help maintain

liquidity and continuity as the price of a stock goes up or down. They may

purchase stock for their investment account only if such purchases are

necessary to create a fair and orderly market.

Specialists balance buy and sell orders at the opening of the trading day

to arrange an equitable opening price for the stock. They participate in the

- pening of the market only to the extent necessary to balance supply and
demand. Although trading throughout the day is conducted as a continuous
auction-based system, as explained earlier, the opening is conducted as a
single-priced call auction system, as determined by the specialists.

If an imbalance between buy and sell orders either at the opening or

during the trading day results in inability to maintain a fair and orderly

market, a specialist may, under restricted conditions, close the market in

that stock (i.e., discontinue trading) until the specialist is able to determine a

price that reestablishes a balance of buy and sell orders. Such closings of

trading can occur either during the trading day or at the opening, which is

more common, and can last for minutes or days. Closings of a day or more

may occur when, for example, one firm acquires another or when a

corporation makes an unexpected announcement. (For this reason, many

announcements are made after the close of trading.)

NYSE trading officials oversee the activities of the specialist and

trading-floor brokers. Approval from these officials must be sought for a

delay in trading at the opening or to halt trading during the trading day

when unusual trading situations or price disparities develop. Because of

their critical public role and the necessity of capital in performing their

function as a market maker, specialists are subject to capital requirements

imposed by the exchanges.

The description of the NYSE so far might leave the impression that the

U.S. market is composed of a specialist-based NYSE; however, the NYSE

made considerable strides toward electronic trading by internal

development, specifically, the electronic DOT and SuperDOT systems

beginning in 1976. But, the greatest changes have been more recent and are

due to acquisitions.

The Pacific Exchange was a regional stock exchange based in San

Francisco until 2001. In 1999, it became the first U.S. stock exchange to

demutualize. Its trading floor in San Francisco was closed in 2002. In 2003,

it initiated an electronic options trading platform. In 2005, the Pacific

Exchange was bought by Archipelago Holdings, the first all-electronic

stock exchange in the United States—this was a significant advancement in

stock trading (Archipelago Holdings began in 1996 in Chicago). In

February 2006, the NYSE (actually, NYSE Euronext) merged with (through

a reverse merger) Archipelago Holdings and changed its name to **NYSE**

**Arca** . (The NYSE demutualized and became the for-profit NYSE Group

just before this merger was accomplished.) Thus, NYSE had the first allelectronic stock trading platform in the United States. NYSE Arca is now

NYSE's electronic trading platform and has significant trading volume.

Arca is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange and is based in Chicago,

where Archipelago, its founder, was located. Arca trades options and

exchanged-traded funds in addition to stocks.

The NYSE continues to explore new markets. The NYSE is noted for its

position with large listed companies and large investors. However, during

2017, it began changing its listing standards and its rule book to attract

listings from IPOs by startups. The mechanism for doing this is "direct

listing." The large IPO listings they are trying to attract are called

"unicorns," which are startups valued \$1 billion or more. Direct listings

permit companies to trade without raising money (as in the typical IPO),

and also no restrictions are imposed regarding when insiders can sell

shares. [5]

The NYSE permits unicorns that want to be publicly traded but have

sufficient cash to dispense with raising funds, so they do not need an

investment banker to do an underwriting.

In a direct listing, a company transfers its shares to an exchange and lets

them trade publicly without being underwritten by a Wall Street bank, as is

the usual case in an IPO. The approach is often used by companies that are

traded in the lightly regulated OTC markets but want to switch to the NYSE

- r Nasdaq. But it is a rare move for private firms, which typically use IPOs
to go public.

Direct listings would allow unicorns to avoid hefty underwriting fees,

which can amount to millions of dollars. The listings also could make it

easier for existing shareholders of these companies to cash out more

quickly. That is because they don't necessarily involve lockup periods,

which are rules designed to protect new investors from a deluge of selling

by making insiders wait before they can unload shares. Executives can also

discuss the company publicly. In a typical IPO, the SEC mandates a quiet

period before the offering.

```
Nasdaq Stock Market: Exchange Market for Unlisted Stocks

```

An OTC stock market is known as a market for unlisted stocks. There are

two such markets. The first is the Nasdaq Stock Market, a national

securities exchange registered with the SEC that trades unlisted stocks. The

second is the collection of unrelated dealers who make markets in unlisted

stocks. With respect to Nasqaq, although this market is referred to as a

market for unlisted stocks, certain "listing requirements" must be

maintained for a stock to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Nevertheless, exchange-traded stocks—such as the NYSE stocks—are

called **listed,** and stocks traded in the Nasdaq Stock Market are called

**unlisted** . Another part of the OTC market, referred to generally as the

"third market," is for truly unlisted stocks (i.e., stocks not traded on the

Nasdaq Stock Market).

The Nasdaq Stock Market is composed of three market tiers: (1) the

Nasdaq Global Select Market; (2) the Nasdaq Global Market; and (3) the

Nasdaq Capital Market. Each market tier has its own financial, liquidity,

and corporate governance requirements that must be satisfied to be

approved for listing. The corporate governance requirements for all tiers are

the same. The most stringent financial and liquidity requirements are for the

Nasdaq Global Select Market, the requirements for the Nasdaq Global

Market are next, and the requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market are

the least stringent. The market capitalization requirement is such that the

Nasdaq Global Select Market includes large market capitalization stocks,

the Nasdaq Global Market includes mid-market capitalization stocks, and

the Nasdaq Capital Market includes small capitalization stocks.

Nasdaq is essentially a telecommunications network that links thousands

- f geographically dispersed market-making participants. Its electronic
quotation system provides price quotations to market participants on
Nasdaq-listed stocks. Although it maintains no central trading floor, Nasdaq
functions as an electronic "virtual trading floor." More than 4,100 common
stocks trade in the Nasdaq system. More than 500 dealers, known as market

makers, representing some of the world's largest securities firms, provide

competing bids to buy and offers to sell Nasdaq stocks to investors. Market

makers must: (1) continuously post firm two-sided quotes good for most

stocks; (2) report trades promptly; (3) be ready for automatic execution

against their quotes; (4) integrate customer limit orders into their

proprietary quotes; and (5) give precedence to customer limit orders and not

place a quote on any system different from their Nasdaq quote unless that

system is linked backed into Nasdaq. Many trades are "internalized," which

means that a broker-dealer firm acts as market maker when executing on a

principal basis the trade of one of its customers. Although not traded on an

exchange, these trades must be reported through regular means, as

discussed below.

```
Alternative Trading Systems

```

As mentioned earlier, ATS are off-exchange trading venues that serve as an

alternative to trading on exchanges and for after-hours trading. There are

two types of ATSs, electronic communication networks and crossing

networks.

```
Electronic communications networks  Electronic communications

```

**`networks`** (ECNs) display quotes that reflect actual orders and provide
members with an anonymous way to enter orders. Essentially, an ECN is a
limit order book that is widely disseminated and open for continuous
trading to subscribers, who may enter and access orders displayed on the
ECN. ECNs offer transparency, anonymity, automated service, and reduced
costs; they are therefore effective for handling small orders. Because ECNs
provide for pre-trade transparency about orders and post-trade transparency
about executed trades, they are referred to as **light pool markets**, as

- pposed to venues known as dark pools that do not provide pre-trade
transparency (we discuss them shortly). It important to note that some
ECNs are now going "dark"—that is; they have dark pools. Similarly, some
dark pools are being "lit"—they are now providing pre-trade transparency.

ECNs are used to disseminate firm commitments to trade (firm bids or

- ffers) to participants, or subscribers, which typically have either purchased
- r leased hardware for the operation of the ECN or have built a custom

connection to the ECN. In general, ECNs use the Internet to link buyers and

sellers, bypassing brokers and trading floors. Examples of ECNs are

Bloomberg Tradebook, Track ECN, and LavaFlow.

An ECN's subscribers include institutional and retail investors, market

makers, and broker-dealers. In chapter 23, we describe the different types of

- rders. ECN subscribers can enter such orders into the ECN, and the orders
will then be posted by the ECN on the system for other subscribers to view.
The listing of the buy and sell orders that subscribers may view is the
ECN's order book. The ECN will then electronically match orders to
complete the execution. The buyer and seller typically remain anonymous
to each other, with the publicly disclosed trade execution reports identifying
the ECN as the counterparty to the trade.

The fee structure an ECN charges depends on the type of order. Orders

either add to or remove liquidity from the ECN's order book. [6] The fee

structure involves a rebate to the party in the transaction that adds liquidity

to the ECN's order book and a fee charged to the counterparty. Incentives in

the form of higher rebates or lower fees may be offered to subscribers based

- n trade volume.

Brokers may allow customers direct market access to an ECN, with the

fee and the rebate passed through from the broker to the customer.

**`Crossing networks`** ATSs allow institutional investors to "cross" trades,
typically matching traders directly by computer buyers and sellers. [7]
Crossing networks are batch processes that aggregate orders for execution
at specified times. Pre-trade transparency varies with the type of crossing
network. Crossing networks that do not provide pre-trade transparency are
called "dark pools."

For dark pools, post-trade transparency is required, but because the

executed transactions are treated as OTC trades, less information is required

than for trades on the NYSE. Because there is no pre-trade transparency

(i.e., no public displaying of orders), dark pools provide institutional

investors with several benefits, including less leakage of information

contained in an order, the avoidance of front-running on large orders, and

reduced market impact costs (a cost we discuss in chapter 23). With respect

to information leakage, the order may be part of a proprietary trading

strategy pursued by an intuitional investor, and a displayed order might

provide information about such strategies to competitors. There is a concern

that other market participants (such as broker-dealers and traders) could

front-run the order, with the result that trading costs would be higher than in

the absence of a public display of an order.

Some dark pools are either moving in the direction of pre-trade

transparency or have done so already. For example, some dark pools use

electronic messages to reveal an indication of interest, which is like a firm

quotation, to a subset of subscribers.

Dark pools are classified based on the minimum size of transactions that

can be traded for each order. **Block-oriented dark pools** set a minimum

size for each order, such as 5,000 shares. **Streaming liquidity pools** have

no minimum size for any order. Other characteristics of dark pools in

addition to trade size are the ownership of the dark pool, who is permitted

to trade in a dark pool (i.e., constituencies), price and order discovery,

liquidity levels and types, accessibility, and the existence of liquidity

partners. Based on the common characteristics of dark pools, Hitesh Mittal

has identified five general categories (which are not necessarily mutually

exclusive): [8]

    _Public crossing networks:_ The traditional dark pools are the public

crossing networks started by brokerage firms. Because of the reduction

in commissions realized by brokerage firms, these dark pools sought to

generate revenue to offset lost commissions. Examples of public

crossing networks are POSIT, POSIT Now, BLOCKalert, Liquidnet,

NYFIX Millennium, Pipeline, and Instinet CBX. A key feature of

public crossing networks that distinguishes them from the other types

   - f dark pools is that there is no proprietary flow from the operator of
the dark pool.

    _Internalization pools:_ Dark pools that are referred to as

"internalization pools" seek primarily to internalize the operator of the

dark pool's trade flow. Internalization pools were initially established

by the major dealers to generate revenue by executing orders within

the trading platform rather than sending those orders to other venues

for execution. The constituents of internalization pools are institutional

and retail investors and the dark pool operator's trading desk;

internalization pools can restrict access to competitors (i.e., other sellside firms). That is, unlike public crossing networks, not all the

liquidity is obtained from external constituents but rather could come

from the dark pool operator's market-making arm or its proprietary

trading desk. However, because of a concern about the potential lack

- f liquidity, operators have partnered with other entities to provide
liquidity. These liquidity partners have a special status as constituents
that may have an adverse impact on the dark pool's regular customers. [9]

_Ping destinations:_ Two features of ping destinations distinguish

them from other dark pools. The first is that if the order placed is not

fulfilled immediately, the order is canceled. Such orders are referred to

as "immediate or cancel" (IOC) orders and, therefore, unlike in other

dark pools, which accept different types of orders, only IOC orders are

accepted. The second distinguishing feature is that customers interact

- nly with the dark pool operator's flow. Typically, this type of dark
pool is operated by either a hedge fund or an electronic market maker.
Customers are typically sell-side firms, not buy-side firms. The
decision by the dark pool operator as to whether to accept an IOC

_._

- rder is based on a quantitative model developed by the operator

_Exchange-based pools:_ Because they are similar in terms of pricing,

dark pools classified as exchange-based pools include two types of

dark pools. The first are dark pools that are registered with the SEC as

national securities exchanges. (Recall that an ATS may elect to be

regulated as a national securities exchange or as a broker-dealer.) The

second type consists of ECNs and exchanges that create pools of

liquidity resulting from hidden orders, where, unlike in other dark

pools, the hidden order usually interacts with regular displayed orders.

Unlike the other categories of dark pools, which charge a fee on a per

share basis, exchange-based pools follow the ECN pricing policy,

which provides fees and rebates depending on whether the transacting

party is a supplier or a taker of liquidity.

    _Consortium-based pools_ : A consortium-based pool is one that is

started by several broker-dealers. Unlike an internalization pool

   - perated by one broker-dealer that may not permit access to other sellside firms (i.e., other broker-dealers), consortium-based pools provide
access to their competitors that are sell-side firms. Broker-dealers that
are partners in a consortium-based pool typically have an
internalization pool for crossing trades so as to generate fee income
before they route a trade to the consortium.

```
Execution of an Order

```

With the considerable number of venues for the secondary trading of

common stock, the processing of an order should be simple. However, that

is not at all the case. The large number of alternative venues has created

fragmented market making. It is important to understand the process by

which an order is executed once it is placed with a broker. The reason is

that how the broker ultimately executes the order affects the price at which

the trade is executed and therefore the overall effective cost of the trade.

On receiving an order from a customer, a broker must decide how to

execute the order. That is, the broker must decide which of the venues

described earlier to use to execute the order. When deciding on the venue,

the broker has an obligation to find the "best execution" that is reasonably

available for customer orders. To do so, the broker considers all customer

- rders and makes an evaluation of which venue gives the most favorable

terms.

When evaluating the alternative venues to obtain the best execution for

customer orders, the broker will look for (1) a better price than quoted in

the market when the order is placed (referred to as "price improvement"),

(2) the likelihood that the order will be executed, and (3) the speed of

execution. The speed of execution is important when a market order is

placed, because in a fast-moving market, any delays in the execution of an

- rder can result in an inferior price than at the time the order was received.
Although the SEC does not set forth any rules that require the execution of
an order be completed within a specific time after the order is placed, a

brokerage firm that advertises about the speed at which it can execute an

- rder would be expected to execute accordingly.

A customer does have the right to direct the broker to use a particular

venue to execute an order, but a cost may be associated with doing so. A fee

may be charged by the broker. Assuming that the customer does not specify

a venue, the broker's decision as to which venue to direct the order to is as

follows. For a stock that is listed on an exchange, the broker has three

choices: (1) direct the order to the exchange where the stock is listed, (2)

direct the order to a regional exchange, or (3) direct the order to a firm that

stands ready to execute the order at publicly quoted prices. For this last

alternative, such firms are referred to as **third market makers.** If instead of

an exchange-listed stock, the order involves an unlisted stock traded on

Nasdaq, the broker may send the order to a market maker on Nasdaq.

To induce brokers to route an order to their venue, regional exchanges,

third market makers, and many Nasdaq market makers will pay brokers a

fee based on the number of shares directed. This practice is referred to as

**payment for order flow** . The broker cannot do this without the approval

and knowledge of the customer. When an account is opened, the brokerage

firm must inform the customer by written notification whether they receive

payment for order flow. This notification must also be provided annually.

Moreover, on a trade confirmation, the customer must be told whether the

broker received a payment for order flow. If the customer desires, more

information about the payment for a trade can be obtained by requesting the

information from a broker.

Two other choices are available to a broker for routing an order: (1) a

division of the broker's firm that can execute the order or (2) an ECN.

When an order is routed internally (i.e., within the brokerage firm), the firm

will fulfill the order from its own inventory. This is referred to as

**internalization of an order** .

```
Market Trading Regulation in the United States

```

Regulation of securities markets, such as the stock market, has three

primary objectives: (1) to protect investors, (2) to ensure the smooth

functioning of the market, and (3) to reduce systemic risk. When seeking to

protect investors, regulation must address information asymmetries between

the issuers of securities and investors. This can be achieved through

disclosure regulation. The smooth functioning of the market involves

trading and settlement rules that minimize the risk of market disruptions.

Systemic risk has been discussed in several earlier chapters in this book.

Here our discussion of stock market regulation in the United States

focuses on secondary market trading regulation. Recent regulations in this

area were the result of financial crises in the stock market that required a

major market regulatory overhaul or of high-profile market disruptions that

necessitated plugging a regulatory gap. We begin with a brief description of

stock market regulation in the United States since the 1960s and then turn to

the current regulators. Finally, we look at several key regulations concerned

with market volatility. We continue with our review of certain stock market

trading regulations in chapter 23, because they require an understanding of

trading strategies that regulators have found can cause market disruption.

```
Regulatory Background

```

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. secondary markets for stocks became

increasingly fragmented. In a **fragmented market**, some orders for a given

stock are handled differently from other orders, as explained earlier in this

chapter. Thus, the treatment of the order differs, depending on where it is

ultimately executed. A differential treatment of orders may also arise if

those orders vary in size, even if they pertain to the same stock and are

executed in the same trading venue.

Regulators were concerned that investors did not uniformly receive the

best execution, that is, that transactions were not necessarily being executed

by a broker on behalf of a customer at the most favorable price available.

Another concern with the increased fragmentation of the secondary market

for stocks had to do with the growing number of completed transactions in

listed stocks that were not reported to the public. This lapse in reporting

happened because transactions in the third market and on the regional

exchanges were not immediately disclosed on the major national exchange

ticker tapes where the stock was listed.

Because of these concerns, Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1975.

The most important and relevant provision of this legislation is Section

11A(a)(2), which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

directed the SEC to "facilitate the establishment of a national market system

for securities." The SEC, in its efforts to implement a national market

system (NMS), targeted six elements, described as follows by N. S.

Posner: [10]

1. A system for public reporting of completed transactions on a
consolidated basis (consolidated tape).

2. A composite system for the collection and display of bid and asked
quotations (composite quotation system).

3. Systems for transmitting from one market to another both orders to
buy and sell securities and reports of completed transactions (market
linkage systems).

4. Elimination of restrictions on the ability of exchange members to
effect OTC transactions in listed securities (off-board trading rules).

5. Nationwide protection of limit price orders against inferior
execution in another market.

6. Rules defining the securities that are qualified to be traded in the

NMS.

These six elements required changes in technology, legislative initiative,

- r both. For example, a consolidated tape, composite quotation system,
market linkage system, and system for nationwide protection of limit price

- rders required changes in technology. The elimination of off-board trading
rules and the specification of securities to be included in a national market
system required legislative initiative. In fact, changes of both types

- occurred.

In 2005, various relevant rules were consolidated into Reg. NMS,

including the Order Protection Rule (also known as "trade-through rule"),

which provides intermarket price priority for quotations that are

immediately and automatically accessible (Rule 610). The Order Protection

Rule has been controversial, because it requires that trades on a trading

venue be transacted at the lowest price rather than on a venue offering the

quickest or the most reliable execution.

Reg. NMS is intended to ensure that investors receive the best price

executions for their orders by encouraging competition in the markets.

Reg. NMS consists of four different rules:

   - "Order Protection Rule" requires trading centers to establish and
enforce written policies designed to prevent the execution of trades at
prices inferior to protected quotations displayed by automated trading

centers;

  - "Access Rule" requires fair and nondiscriminatory access to
quotations, establishes a limit on access fees to harmonize the pricing

   - f quotations across different trading centers, and requires each
national securities exchange and association to adopt and enforce rules
that prohibit their members from displaying quotations that lock or
cross automated quotations;

   - "Sub-Penny Rule" prohibits market participants from accepting,
ranking, or displaying orders, quotations, or indications of interest in a
pricing increment smaller than a penny, except for orders priced at less
than \$1.00 per share; and

   - "Market Data Rules" update the requirements for consolidating,
distributing, and displaying market information.

Overall, the general issue that the SEC has faced is how to design the

NMS. Should it be structured as an electronic linkage of existing exchange

floors? Or should it be an electronic trading system that is not tied to any

existing exchange? After experimenting with several pilot programs, the

SEC developed a set of arrangements for listed stocks.

As explained earlier in this chapter, although the market has evolved to

an electronic trading platform since 1978, market fragmentation continues.

```
Market Regulation

```

Here we describe regulation involving three activities: market volatility,

short selling, and insider trading. More on market regulation is provided in

the next chapter after we describe the various types of trading arrangements

used by investors.

**`Market volatility rules`** Market volatility rules involve trading limit
rules and circuit breakers.

**`Trading limit rules`** **Trading limit** (also referred to as a **price limit** )
specifies a minimum price limit below which the market price index level
may not decline because of an institutionally mandated termination of
trading, at least at prices below the specified price (the price limit), for a

was

specified period of time. For example, suppose that a market index [11]

trading at 11,000 and its price limit was 500 points below that: Then no

trades could occur below 10,500. This pause in trading is intended to "give

the market a breather" to at least calm emotions. Two different types of

price limits are circuit breakers and trading collars. We discuss each here.

**`Circuit-breaker rules`** A **circuit breaker** is a temporary halting of
trading during a severe market decline. The key to instituting circuit
breakers is coordination and infrequency. Coordination across markets is
important because of the interrelationship among the stock market, stock
index futures market, and stock index options market. We discuss this
relationship in chapter 35. The infrequency with which trading was
temporarily suspended was emphasized by several governmentand
exchange-sponsored studies after Black Monday. These studies noted that
too frequent halting of trading other than in the case of extreme movements
impedes price discovery and does not allow the efficient implementation of
portfolio strategies by investors.

Two types of circuit breakers have been adopted to deal with significant

market volatility: market-wide circuit breakers and single-stock circuit

breakers. The regulations deal with market-wide circuit-breaker rules that

would be implemented depending on the level of market volatility. The

trading could halt temporarily, or, in the case of extreme market volatility,

the market could close before the normal close of the trading session. The

stock market indicator selected to measure market volatility for determining

trading halts is the S&P 500. The three circuit-breaker thresholds are 7%

(Level 1), 13% (Level 2), and 20% (Level 3), with the triggers based on

levels that are computed daily from the previous day's closing price of the

S&P 500 index. Here is what the three levels mean. If a market decline that

is either Level 1 or Level 2 occurs before 3:25 p.m., a market-wide

suspension of trading activity will be imposed for 15 minutes; in contrast, if

that trigger occurs on or after 3:25 p.m., no market-wide trading halt is

required. In the extreme case of a market decline that occurs any time

during the trading day triggered by a Level 3 circuit breaker, a market-wide

trading halt is required for the balance of the trading day.

Single-stock circuit-breaker rules were adopted by the SEC in response

to extreme movements in the prices of many individual stocks that did not

result in the triggering of the market-wide circuit breakers. In May 2012,

however, the SEC replaced the single-stock circuit-breaker rules with what

is referred to as the "limit up–limit down" rule. The previous single-stock

circuit-breaker rules were triggered _after_ a trade occurred and at times could

be triggered by erroneous trades. The intention of the limit up–limit down

rule is to prevent trades in individual stocks from being executed outside a

specified price band. The price band is established as a percentage level

above and below the stock's average price, where the average price is

computed over the immediately preceding five-minute trading period.

Failure of the price of a stock trading outside the price band to return to a

price in the band within 15 seconds results in a five-minute trading halt.

**`Short selling rules`** In chapter 18, we described short selling and the
mechanism for selling a security short. A short sale is the sale of a security
not owned by an investor. The expectation of an investor who shorts a
security is that the price will decline, so that the investor can purchase the
security at a future date at a price less than the price at which the security
was sold. Short selling is illegal only if it done by an investor with an intent
to manipulate the market. An example of such a manipulative practice
would be an investor entering into a series of transactions with the intent of
depressing a security's price so as induce the purchase or sale of the
security by others.

Rules adopted by the SEC to deal with short sales include the alternative

uptick rule and rules applied to naked short selling. The current short sale

price test restriction for stocks, commonly referred to as the **alternative**

**uptick rule**, [12] restricts short selling from further driving down a stock's

price that has fallen more than 10% in a single trading day, with the drop

being calculated based on the closing price on the previous trading day. If

this short-sale-related circuit breaker is triggered, short selling is permitted

- nly if the security's price exceeds the current national best bid.

Although the mechanism for selling short involves borrowing the

shorted security to cover the sales, there are short sales where no borrowing

- ccurs or no arrangement is made for borrowing in time for the settlement
- f the shorted security to the buyer. This is referred to as **naked short**
**selling** . It may result in the short seller not being able to deliver the shorted
security. A failure to deliver at the required settlement date is referred to as
a "fail." Naked short selling is not a violation of SEC regulations. In fact,
the practice of short selling may add liquidity to the market. A good
example is the liquidity provided by a market maker who stands ready to
sell a security continuously throughout the day. The market maker would
effectively be pursuing a naked short selling if the market maker did not
have the security in inventory and there were no sellers of the security in
the market. In its objective of making a market for the security in a fastmoving market, the market maker may not have the time to arrange to cover
the security sold through some borrowing arrangement or by the purchase

- f the security. The SEC adopted rules to deal with the problems associated
with failed trades.

**`Insider trading rules`** An activity that undermines the confidence that
investors have in the fairness and integrity of the stock market is trading in
a stock by an insider using material nonpublic information. In general
terms, the SEC describes illegal insider trading activity as the trading in a
security that is "in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust
and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information
about the security." [13] This is not a legal definition, because the laws dealing
with insider trading are shaped by judicial opinions. That is, although

Congress gave the SEC responsibility and the enforcement powers (both

criminal and civil) to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the

market, what constitutes insider trading has been developed on a case-bycase basis under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws

(principally Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

described shortly).

Examples of insiders and illegal insider trading are corporate officers,

directors, and employees who trade their corporation's stock following the

acquisition of information that is a significant, confidential corporate

development. Insider trading violations extend to others who may have

received a tip ("tippees") from a person (the "tipper") who had access to

material, nonpublic information. Examples of tippees are family members,

friends, and business associates of such officers, directors, and employees

who trade the securities after receiving such information. [14]

Not all trading by insiders is illegal. That is, corporate insiders can

legally buy or sell the stock of their corporation provided the trading

activity is not based on material, nonpublic information. Of course, when

bringing any legal action against a corporate insider who buys or sells a

stock prior to a major movement in the stock, the SEC must demonstrate

that the trading activity was based on insider information. Trading their own

corporation's stock by corporate insiders must be reported to the SEC

within a specified time of the incident.

The federal securities laws covering insider trading are set forth in

Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which makes it

illegal for individuals

to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national

securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or

contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.

The SEC adopted Rule 10b-5 to implement Section 10(b). This rule

defines when a trade is done on the basis of material nonpublic information.

The SEC has two rules that make up Rule 10b-5: Rule 10b-5-1 and Rule

10b-5-2. The former applies to a person who trades on the basis of material

nonpublic information if that person at the time of the trade knows that the

information in his or her possession is in fact material nonpublic

information. Conditions under which permissible trading may be done by

an insider are described. For example, an insider is allowed to trade if that

information is not a factor in the decision to trade. An example would be an

executive who has an established investment plan that specifies the

automatic purchase of the corporation's stock at designated time intervals.

The second part of Rule 10b-5, Rule 10b-5-2, applies to nonbusiness

relationships' (e.g., family members' and friends') use of material

nonpublic information when trading. The rule provides circumstances in

which such nonbusiness relationships create what the SEC refers to as a

"duty of trust or confidence" that if used by a person would be breached by

the disclosure of material nonpublic information and would be considered

illegal. [15]

```
Other Types of Common Stock Trading

```

Other types of common stock trading vehicles and security types are

available to investors.

```
Offshore Trading

```

Broker-dealers may trade exchange-listed and Nasdaq equities offshore on

foreign exchanges (e.g., the Bermuda Stock Exchange) or OTC through

foreign trading desks (e.g., a broker-dealer's London office). In general,

such transactions must be reported to a U.S. marketplace (typically the third

market) during the next trading day.

```
Rule 144A Securities

```

Rule 144A, adopted by the SEC in April 1990, is designed to facilitate

secondary market trading in nonfungible unregistered securities among

qualified institutional buyers by providing a "safe harbor" from the

registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Qualified

institutional buyers are institutions with \$100 million invested in the

securities of issuers not affiliated with the qualified buyer. Basically, Rule

144A permits the issue of nonregistered securities and their purchase by

qualified institutions.

**American depository receipts** (ADRs) are negotiable certificates in
registered form, issued in the United States by a U.S. bank, which certify
that a specific number of foreign shares have been deposited with an

- verseas branch of the bank (or another financial institution) that acts as a
custodian in the country of origin.

ADRs provide an opportunity for investors who want to invest in the

shares of a foreign corporation to buy, hold, and sell their interests in these

foreign securities without having to take physical possession of the

securities, and while receiving dividends and exercising voting rights

conveniently. A holder of an ADR can at any time request the underlying

shares. Conversely, ADRs enable foreign corporations with shares that have

not been admitted to a U.S. stock exchange to obtain access to the U.S.

public capital market. Usually, only shares traded on a recognized foreign

stock exchange are represented by ADRs. ADRs are discussed in greater

detail below.

When a corporation's equities are traded in a foreign market, they are

typically in the form of a **global depository receipt** (GDR), regardless of

whether they were issued in the foreign market. GDRs are issued by banks

as evidence of ownership of the underlying stock of a foreign corporation

that the bank holds in trust. Each GDR may represent ownership of one or

more shares of common stock of a corporation. The advantage of the GDR

structure to the corporation is that the corporation does not have to comply

with all the regulatory issuing requirements of the foreign country where

the stock is to be traded. GDRs are typically, but not always, sponsored by

the issuing corporation. That is, the issuing corporation works with a bank

to offer its common stock in a foreign country through the sale of GDRs.

As an example, consider the U.S. version of the GDR, the ADR, just

discussed above. The combination of GDRs and ADRs for a given

company is called simply a "depository receipt." The initial success of the

ADR structure in the United States resulted in the rise of GDRs throughout

the world. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and pay dividends in U.S.

dollars, but the basis for these payments is the local currency of the

underlying stock. Thus, a change in the exchange rate between the local

currency of the underlying corporation and the U.S. dollar will affect the

ADR's U.S. dollar price and dividend.

ADRs can be created in one of two ways. First, one or more banks or

brokerage firms can assemble a large block of the shares of a foreign

corporation and issue ADRs without the participation of the foreign

corporation, in which case the ADRs are called **unsponsored ADRs** . The

Bank of New York is the leading U.S. depository bank for ADRs. More

typically, however, with **sponsored ADRs**, the foreign corporation seeks to

have its stock traded in the United States. In these instances, only one

depository bank issues the ADRs. Periodic financial reports in English are

provided by the issuing corporation to the holders of an ADR.

By construction, ADRs are not a direct holding in the company but a

derivative created by a financial institution that holds the underlying

securities. The holder of an ADR typically does not have voting or

preemptive rights. The decision to treat ADR holders differently from direct

stockholders, however, is at the discretion of the company. This distinction

sometimes may not be applied. [16]

ADRs can either be traded on one of the exchanges or traded in the OTC

market. The unsponsored ADR is typically traded in the OTC market.

Because ADRs can be continuously created to meet investor demand, they

provide the same trading liquidity as the home market securities they

represent.

A U.S. investor who buys an ADR of an international company rather

than hold the international stock directly can realize several advantages.

First, the investor can trade the stock in a U.S. market (on an exchange or

OTC) during U.S. hours and according to U.S. trading practices. Second,

the investor makes and receives payments in U.S. dollars rather than foreign

currency, although as already mentioned, the investor is subject to foreign

exchange risk. Finally, the U.S. investor can use a U.S. custodian rather

than a global one, which can be easier and save costs, and in some cases,

can avoid some country-specific taxes.

```
Euro Equity

```

Corporations may issue equities outside their home market to finance

subsidiaries in other countries or to reduce the cost of raising equity capital.

In fact, new equity issues may be offered in more than one country

simultaneously. The term **euro equity** applies to a stock issue offered

simultaneously in several countries by an international syndicate.

U.S. corporations engage in equity offerings that, in addition to the

primary U.S. component, include a portion of the issuance reserved for sale

in the Euromarkets. This portion of a newly issued stock is referred to as a

**euro-equity tranche** . Similarly, European firms offer equity securities with

a U.S. tranche. The innovation of the euro-equity markets was not a matter

- f new equity securities or structures. Instead, the innovation consisted of
an efficient international system for selling and distributing equity offerings
to various markets in different countries at the same time.

```
Key Points

```

- Equity securities represent an ownership interest in a corporation, giving
the investor the right to receive the earnings of the corporation when those
earnings are distributed in the form of dividends.

   - The two types of equity securities are common stock and preferred
stock, the latter being a senior corporate security, because it has
priority over the common stock in a claim on assets in a liquidation
and receives a fixed dividend before common stock holders receive

their dividends.

   - The equity market has changed dramatically over the past 50 years
because of (1) the institutionalization of the stock market as a result of
a shift away from traditional small investors to large institutional
investors, (2) changes in government regulation of the market, and (3)
innovation owing largely to advances in computer technology.

  - Important consequences of the shifting of the market from one
dominated by retail investors to one dominated by institutional
investors have included the redesign of equity trading systems to
accommodate the types of trading required by institutional investors.

   - To ensure that investors are protected against fraudulent practices
that might be followed by corporations when issuing stock and by

brokers and dealers when executing orders by investors, the equity

market is highly regulated.

- Regulation is carried out by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC, a federal regulator), the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA, a self-regulatory organization), and
state regulators.

- The SEC is responsible for (1) interpreting and enforcing federal
securities laws; (2) issuing new rules and amending existing rules; (3)

- verseeing and monitoring market participants; (4) overseeing private
self-regulatory organizations involved in the securities field, including
accounting and auditing organizations; and (5) coordinating regulation
with other federal and state regulators and foreign authorities.

- FINRA is an independent, not-for-profit organization authorized by
Congress.

- FINRA's dual objective is to protect investors and to foster market
integrity.

- FINRA writes and enforces rules governing the activities of
securities firms, examines securities firms for compliance with those
rules, and fosters market transparency.

- State securities laws focus on the issuance of securities and periodic
disclosure as opposed to market regulation.

- Equity trading in the United States typically occurs either on a
national securities exchange or on an alternative trading system.

- The different types of trading venues can be classified in terms of
their listing on an exchange: exchange-traded stocks (also called
"listed" stocks) and OTC (unlisted) stocks.

- Information provided by trading venues is important for market

transparency.

- Disclosure of a stock's supply and demand by a trading venue is
referred to as "pre-trade transparency" and is measured by the bid-ask
prices for a stock.

- The order book shows a stock's pre-trade transparency information,
providing an indication of the liquidity and depth of the market for that

stock.

- Pre-trade transparency is provided by the display of the stock's
national best bid and offer (NBBO) on the Consolidated Quote
System. The Consolidated Tape System provides post-trade
transparency by providing post-trade data, including the transaction
price and the quantity traded.

- Regional stock exchanges compete with the major national
exchanges for the execution of smaller trades. Major national
brokerage firms route such orders to regional exchanges because of the
lower cost they charge for executing orders or better prices.

- The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the major exchange on
which listed stocks are traded.

- On the NYSE, trading is done in a centralized continuous auction
market at a designated location by a single specialist who is the market
maker for each stock.

- Although at one time, the NYSE was a pure continuous-order
market, today it uses both a continuous auction during the trading day
and a call auction to open and close the market.

- Specialists are required to conduct the auction process and maintain
an orderly market in one or more designated stocks.

- Specialists may act as both a broker (agent) and a dealer (principal).
- A specialist conducts activities so as to maintain a fair and orderly
market, which means a market that is characterized by price continuity
and reasonable depth.

- The OTC market has two components: (1) the national securities
exchange, which is registered with the SEC and trades unlisted stocks,
and (2) the third market.

- The national securities exchange registered with the SEC is the
Nasdaq Stock Market, which has listing requirements that must be
maintained for a stock to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

- The Nasdaq Stock Market is composed of three market tiers: (1) the
Nasdaq Global Select Market, (2) the Nasdaq Global Market, and (3)
the Nasdaq Capital Market.

- Nasdaq is essentially a telecommunications network that links
thousands of geographically dispersed market-making participants.

- Nasdaq market makers must continuously post firm two-sided
quotations good for most stocks.

- Many Nasdaq trades are "internalized," which means that a brokerdealer firm acts as market maker when executing on a principal basis
the trade of one of its customers.

- An alternative trading system (ATS) is a trading venue that serves as
an alternative to trading on exchanges and for after-hours trading.

- There are two types of ATSs: electronic communication networks
(ECNs) and crossing networks.

- ECNs display quotations that reflect actual orders and provide
subscribers (which include institutional and retail investors, market
makers, and broker-dealers) with an anonymous way to enter orders.

- ECNs provide both pre-trade transparency about orders and posttrade transparency about executed trades and are referred to as "light
pool markets."

- The fee structure imposed by an ECN depends on whether the order
adds liquidity to or removes liquidity from the ECN's order book.

- Crossing networks are an ATS where orders are aggregated for
execution at specified times, with pre-trade transparency varying by
crossing network.

- Crossing networks that do not provide pre-trade transparency are
called "dark pools." Post-trade transparency is required, but because
the executed transactions are treated as OTC trades, less information is
required than for a trade on the NYSE.

- When there is no public displaying of orders (i.e., no pre-trade
transparency) in crossing networks, dark pools provide institutional
investors several benefits: they reduce information leakage contained
in an order, avoid front-running of large orders, and lower marketimpact costs.

- Dark pools are sorted into five general categories: public crossing
networks, internalization pools, ping destinations, exchange-based

pools, and consortium-based pools.

- When deciding where to execute a customer's order, a broker has an
- bligation to find the "best execution" that is reasonably available for
customer orders.

- When evaluating alternative trading venues to obtain the best
execution, a broker will consider (1) a better price than quoted in the
market when the order is placed, (2) the likelihood that the order will
be executed, and (3) the speed of execution.

- A broker may route an order to a division of his or her firm for
execution. This is referred to as "internalization" of an order.

- Federal regulation of securities markets has three primary objectives:
(1) to protect investors, (2) to ensure the smooth functioning of the
market, and (3) to reduce systemic risk.

- The U.S. equity market is referred to as a "fragmented market,"
because some orders for a given stock are handled differently from

- ther orders.
- Trading or price limits specify a minimum price limit, below which
the market price index level may not decline because of an
institutionally mandated termination of trading, at least at prices below
the specified price (the price limit), for a specified period of time.

- A circuit breaker is a condition precipitating a temporary halting of
trading during a severe market decline. There are market-wide circuit
breakers and single-stock circuit breakers.

- The two rules that the SEC has adopted to deal with short sales are
the alternative uptick rule and a rule to deal with naked short selling.

- The purpose of the alternative uptick rule is to restrict short selling
from further driving down the price of a stock that has fallen by more
than 10% in a single trading day from the closing price on the previous
trading day.

- Naked short selling refers to a short sale where no borrowing of the
stock occurs or no arrangement with the buyer is made for borrowing
in time for the settlement of the shorted security.

- The risk with naked short selling is that the short seller is not able to
deliver the shorted security.

- Although there is no legal definition of insider trading, the SEC
describes illegal insider trading activity as trading in a security that is
"in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and
confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information
about the security."

- What constitutes insider trading has been developed on a case-bycase basis under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
- Not all trading by corporate insiders is illegal, because they can
legally buy or sell the stock of their corporation as long as the trading
activity is not based on material nonpublic information.

- The SEC adopted Rule 10b-5-1 and Rule10b-5-2 to implement
federal securities law dealing with insider trading.

- Other types of common stock trading vehicles and security types are
available to investors: offshore trading, Rule 144A securities, and
American depository receipts (ADRs).

- A company may want to list its shares on the exchanges of other
countries in order to diversify its sources of capital across national
boundaries and tap various funds available globally for investment in
new issues. Management may believe that an internationally varied

- wnership diminishes the prospect of takeover by other domestic
concerns, or it may expect foreign listings to boost the company's
name awareness and, as a result, the sales of the company's products.

- When a corporation's equities are traded in a foreign market, they
are typically in the form of a global depository receipt (GDR),
regardless of whether they were issued in the foreign market. GDRs
are issued by banks as evidence of ownership of the underlying stock

- f a foreign corporation that the bank holds in trust.
- The advantage of the GDR structure to the corporation is that the
corporation does not have to comply with all the regulatory issuing
requirements of the foreign country where the stock is to be traded.

  - New equity issues may be offered in more than one country
simultaneously. The term "euro equity" is used to describe a new stock

   - ffering that is offered simultaneously in several countries by an
international syndicate.

mechanics, trading costs, and trading strategies.

```
Equity Asset Classes

```

As explained in chapter 1, market participants talk about asset classes.

Common stock or equity is one of the major asset classes. Based on studies

- f the performance of different categories of common stock, the market
practice is to treat categories of stocks based on market capitalization and
style. We discuss each category below.

```
Asset Classes Based on Market Capitalization

```

In the second half of the 1970s, many academic studies suggested that

simple categorization of stocks should be based on size as measured by

market capitalization, because these size categories produced different

performance patterns. A company's market capitalization (referred to simply

as "market cap") is equal to the total market value of its common stock. It is

calculated as follows:

Market cap = Price per share × Number of shares.

The calculation seems straightforward enough, except that "Number of

shares" must be defined.

Two methods are used to calculate a company's market cap: the fullmarket cap method and free-float cap method. In the full market cap method,

the number of shares used to calculate a company's market cap is all shares

- utstanding. In the free-float cap method, the number of shares used is the
number of shares available in the market. The reason the number of shares

available in the market differs from the free float is that there are shares

given to, for example, top management, board members, and key employees.

Thus, market cap based on the free-float cap method will produce a lower

market cap than that using the full-market cap method.

Many services that calculate market caps for purposes of constructing a

stock market index use the free-float market cap method. The reason for

using this method to construct a stock market index is that it provides a

better indication of the stock market trends, because only those shares

available for trade are considered. That is, only the shares of stocks that are

available for trading are included.

The following are classified as asset classes for stocks based on market

capitalization:

   - mega-capitalization stocks (greater than \$200 billion),
   - large-capitalization stocks (\$10 billion to \$200 billion),
   - mid-capitalization stocks (\$1 billion to \$10 billion),
   - small-capitalization stock (\$300 million to \$1 billion),
   - micro-capitalization stocks (\$50 million to \$300 million), and
   - nano-capitalization stocks (less than \$50 million).

```
Asset Classes Based on Style

```

In the early 1970s, academic studies found that there were categories of

stocks that had similar characteristics and performance patterns. Moreover,

the returns of these stock categories performed differently than did those of

- ther categories of stocks. That is, the returns of stocks in a given category
were highly correlated, and the returns between different categories of stocks
were relatively uncorrelated. Practitioners began to view these categories of
stocks with similar performance as a "style" of investing. Today, the notion

- f an equity investment style is widely accepted in the investment
community. The acceptance of equity style investing can also be seen from
the proliferation of style indexes published by several vendors, as well as the
introduction of futures and options contracts based on some of these style
indexes.

There are many ways to classify stocks based on style. The most common

is in terms of one or more measures of "growth" and "value." These

value/growth style categories have garnered ample empirical support. The

most commonly used measure for classifying stocks as growth or value is

the price-to-book value per share (P/B) ratio. The use of this measure is

justified as follows. A company's earnings growth will increase the book

value per share. Assuming that there is no change in the company's P/B

ratio, its stock price will increase if earnings grow. Thus, the lower the P/B

ratio is, the more the stock looks like a value stock; the higher the P/B ratio

is, the more the stock looks like a growth stock.

When classifying stock as value and growth, the notion of "lower P/B"

and "higher P/B" is relative. The way in which the stocks comprising a

universe of stocks (say, the S&P 500) is placed in one of these two

categories is done as follows:

_Step 1:_ Calculate the total market capitalization of all the stocks in the

universe.

_Step 2:_ Calculate the P/B ratio for each stock in the universe.

_Step 3:_ Sort the stocks from the lowest P/B ratio to the highest P/B

ratio.

_Step 4:_ Calculate the accumulated market capitalization starting from

the lowest P/B ratio stock to the highest P/B ratio stock.

_Step 5:_ Select the lowest P/B stocks up to the point where half of the

total market capitalization computed in Step 1 is found.

_Step 6:_ Classify the stocks found in Step 5 as value stocks.

_Step 7:_ Classify the remaining stocks from the universe as growth

stocks.

Any given growth and value style has a substyle based on some measure

- f size (market cap), as discussed above. The combinations of style and size
are often displayed as in the following grid:

Large value Large growth

Small value Small growth

The four cells shown in the above grid have different risk/return

combinations. In addition to book value (B), style is often calculated as a

ratio to earnings (E); that is, the style ratio is P/E, the price-to-earnings ratio.

```
Stock Market Indexes

```

Stock market indexes perform a variety of functions, from serving as

benchmarks for evaluating the performance of professional money managers

to answering the question, "How did the market do today?" Thus, stock

market indexes (or averages) are a part of everyday life. In general, stock

market indexes rise and fall in fairly similar patterns. However, the various

indexes do not move in exactly the same way at all times. The differences in

movement reflect the different methods used for the construction of the

indexes. Common stock indexes that are popularly cited in the media, and

which are discussed below, are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P

500 Index, and the Nasdaq Index.

Now let us consider how stock indexes are created. To begin with, every

stock index needs a sponsor, whose job it is to define the stocks in the index,

collect the prices of these stocks on a daily basis, calculate the index from

these prices, and distribute the index to users.

There are two different types of sponsors. The first type of sponsor is the

exchange on which the stocks in the index are traded. The New York Stock

Exchange Index and the Nasdaq Index are examples of this type of sponsor.

The second type is an independent financial organization that defines,

calculates, and distributes the index. The Standard & Poor's Indexes and the

Dow Jones Industrial Averages are examples of indexes having this type of

sponsor.

A sponsor must make three decisions when developing an index from the

individual stock prices. The first decision is how to define the general

category or universe of the stocks to be included in the index. For example,

the S&P 500 is intended to capture large capitalization (cap) U.S. stocks, the

Russell 2000 captures small cap U.S. stocks, and the MSCI Developed

Country Index captures the non-U.S. stocks from developed countries. Also,

among the other categories represented in indexes besides size (large cap and

small cap) are style (value and growth) and sector (financial, industrial).

Given the stocks included in the general category, the second decision

that must be made is the selection of the specific stocks to be included in the

index. The sponsors of some indexes choose the individual stocks in this

universe in a transparent, rules-based methodology. The Russell indexes and

the MSCI indexes are of this type. For example, the Russell 3000 is

composed on an annual basis (on June 30 of each year) of the 3,000 largest

stocks (by market cap). Other indexes are chosen by subjective decisions by

the organization sponsoring the index. The S&P indexes and the Dow Jones

Industrial Average indexes are based on such an ad hoc basis.

The third decision that must be made is the method used for weighting

the individual stocks in the overall index, which we discuss next.

```
Stock Weighting Methods

```

Three weighting methods have been traditionally used. The first method is

**price weighting** ; that is, using one share of each stock chosen (or the same

number of shares). The second method is **equal weighting** ; that is, using

equal dollar values (e.g., \$100) of each stock in the index. The third method

is market **capitalization weighting** (price multiplied by the number of

shares outstanding), that is, equal "cap weighting" values of each stock in

the index.

Consider an example where two stocks are chosen to be in an index. Each

- f these three weighting methods is used to construct a weighted average of

these two stock prices. Only the variables used as the weights differ. In our

example, we will use two hypothetical stocks, A and B, with prices \$5 and

\$25, respectively, and market caps of \$20 billion and \$50 billion,

respectively, as shown in table 23.1. The weights calculated according to

each method are shown in the table in parentheses. The asset allocations (the

percentage of each stock in the index) of A and B for each of the three

weighting methods are also shown in the table. These numbers represent the

fraction of the index in stocks A and B (i.e., the weight assigned to each

stock). There is a considerable range of weights for A and B, depending on

the weighting method used: from 16.7% (for price weighted) to 50% (for

equal weighted) for Stock A.

```
Table 23.1
```

Stock weights by index weighting methods—hypothetical data.

Stock Price Weighted Equal Weighted Market Cap Weighted

A 16.7% (5/30) 50% 28.6% (20/70)

B 83.3% (25/30) 50% 71.4% (50/70)

Total 100% 100% 100%

Table 23.2 provides an example of actual data for calculating these

indexes for a stock universe consisting of only two stocks—Alphabet

(formerly Google) and Ford Motor—which, let's assume, represent the

entire stock market. The data are from May 21, 2016. Again, the three

different indexes can be calculated from the data for these two stocks using

the three different weighting methods. Note that the weight for Alphabet

varies from 98.2% to 89.0% to 50% for the three weighting methods. The

weights for Ford Motor vary from 0.098% to 50%. This example shows the

very significant changes in the assigned weights for portfolios using these

different weighting methods.

```
Table 23.2

```

Stock index weighting methods—actual data.

Consider the metric for the "size" of a stock that we used in the

illustration above—market capitalization. Although other measures of size

are considered, the common metric is market capitalization, that is, the

number of shares outstanding of the stock times the price of each share.

Historically, the earliest weighting methodology was the price weighted

index, adopted for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), first published

- n May 26, 1896. This method involves simply buying one share of each
stock in the index. Accordingly, to calculate the value of the index, the index
provider simply adds the prices of the stocks and then divides by the number

- f stocks in the index. This method is still used for the DJIA (it now includes
30 stocks chosen by Dow Jones & Company, not all of which are currently
industrials, despite the name given to the index). Thus, the price weighted
average index would be tilted toward high priced stocks regardless of their
market capitalization.

The equal-weighted method means that an investor selects the same value

- f each stock in the index. Thus, for an S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index,
\$1.00 of each of the 500 stocks would be included, for a total portfolio of
\$500.00 with each stock holding 0.2% (that is, $1.00/$500.00) of the total
portfolio. Thus, the biggest and smallest (by market cap) stocks in the S&P
500 would have the same weights in the portfolio, obviously a "tilt" away
from large stocks and toward small stocks. There are several equal-weighted
S&P 500 mutual funds and exchange-trade funds (ETFs).

Both price weighted and equal-weighted indexes have significant

limitations. The only justification for a price weighted index is that when the

DJIA was developed in the 1890s, the only data readily available were stock

prices. This index remains popular due to its simplicity and history. But the

relationship between a stock's price and anything fundamental about the

stock is spurious. In this regard, consider the data for ExxonMobil and

FedEx on May 20, 2016:

Price Market Cap

ExxonMobil $89.74 $372.12 billion

FedEx $161.63 $43.39 billion

It seems inappropriate to have an index in which FedEx has a weight 80%

higher than that of ExxonMobil ($161.63/$89.74 = 1.80) due simply to the

fact that its price is 80% higher and even though ExxonMobil has a market

cap that is more than eight times larger than that of FedEx (373.12/43.39 =

8.6).

The equal-weighted index also has a strong small-cap bias, which would

cause confounding problems for an investor during a large-cap stock rally.

As a result, it is not surprising that most indexes currently employ the third

method—the market cap method—as the metric for size, and thus are market

cap–weighted indexes.

Let us return to table 23.2, which shows the index weights for Alphabet

and Ford Motor for May 21, 2016, for the three weighting methodologies.

Note that the resultant weights vary widely for the price weighting, equal

weighting, and market cap–weighting calculations. The market cap–

weighted index appears to be more reasonable than either the equal-weighted

- r price-weighted index.

There are also theoretical arguments favoring market cap weighting.

First, market cap–weighted portfolios are "macro consistent," meaning that

if all investors invested in such a portfolio, all available shares in its universe

would be held, and none would be left over, and so the prices would be

stable equilibrium prices. With the other weighting methods, it is

mathematically impossible for all investors to hold the stocks in this index

portfolio at the initial prices. Thus, changes in portfolio holdings would be

necessary, and security prices would change for all other weighting methods.

Thus, if an investor holds a market cap–weighted portfolio and some market

prices change, it is not necessary to rebalance the portfolio weights for the

portfolio to continue to replicate the index—that is, the portfolio remains

"indexed." Not needing to rebalance to maintain index weights is a major

practical and operational advantage of market cap weighting. It also

conserves transaction costs. As a result, it is not surprising that most equity

portfolio families employ primarily market cap weighting. These families

include S&P, Russell, MSCI, and Morningstar.

But there is a major concern about market cap weighting. As mentioned,

equal weighting has a small-cap bias. Recently, it has been pointed out that

market cap weighting has a large-cap growth bias with, perhaps, some

resulting investment disadvantages.

Given its theoretical advantage (macro consistency), operational

advantage (no need for rebalancing), intuitive sense that securities should be

weighted by size when forming an index, and given that market cap is the

common measure of size for equities, it is not surprising that market cap

weighting has become the dominant index weighting mechanism.

Recently, however, a limitation of the market cap–weighting method has

been recognized. Consider portfolios that were indexed to or just followed

generally the S&P 500 index as a benchmark during the tech bubble of 1995

to March 2000. During this period, significant appreciation was realized by

large cap growth stocks, primarily due to the technology sector, at the

expense of other sectors of the stock market. As this mania for large cap

growth technology stocks continued, it became self-propelling because of

the indexation process. As investments in large cap growth stocks continued,

their prices increased, and as they became a component of the S&P 500

Index, they became overvalued. These investments were funded by the

liquidation of large cap value and small cap value stocks. These purchases of

larger cap growth stocks occurred due to either strict indexing or using

indexing as a general benchmark.

As a result, this process led to large growth stocks becoming more

expensive (higher price) due to buying as part of the index, and large and

small value stocks becoming cheaper due to their lack of demand (because

they were not part of the index). In essence, investors were buying expensive

large cap growth technology stocks and selling—or not buying—cheap

small cap value stocks. That is, they were "buying high and selling low,"

hardly an ideal investment strategy. Of course, bubbles always eventually

burst, as this one did during 2000–2002. Note in the table below the sharp

reversal of the returns of large cap growth and small cap value stocks from

1998, the core of the tech bubble, to 2001 after the bubble burst.

In the bubble year of 1998, large growth stocks significantly outperformed

small value stocks. In the bubble-bursting year of 2001, this pattern reversed.

Returns

Large Growth Small Value

1998 0.3464 - 0.0863

2001 - 0.1559 0.4024

These results indicate that market cap–weighted index strategies promote

- verbuying and overselling and thus cause volatile markets. Proponents of
this view also proposed an alternative to market cap–weighted indexes.
These proponents agree that size is a correct metric for weighting stocks in
an index. They assert, however, that market cap is the wrong measure of
size. It is the price variable in the market cap metric for size that promotes

- verbuying and subsequent overselling, basically providing self-fulfilling
prophecies. These critics instead assert that the measure of size used should
be a "fundamental" variable from corporate financial statements (income
statement and balance sheet), rather than a price-based measure. It is the
price variable in the size measure that causes the extreme overreactions.
These alternate variables include net income, dividends, sales, cash flow,
book value, among others. Such indexes weight stock prices by a measure of
size, but that measure does not have a self-perpetuating feature, because it
does not include the stock price variable. This approach has come to be
known as "fundamental indexing." Many mutual funds and ETFs based on
fundamental factors have become available. The most common fundamental

factors used are net income and dividends. However, market cap–weighted

indexes still dominate institutional and individual markets.

Although market cap weighting gives indexes a large-cap and growth

bias, weighting by fundamental factors (such as net income and dividends)

gives indexes a value tilt.

```
Major U.S. Stock Market Indexes

```

As mentioned earlier, stock market indicators can be classified into two

groups: those produced by stock exchanges based on all stocks traded on the

respective exchange, and those produced by other financial organizations

that subjectively select the stocks to be included in an index.

The first group includes the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index,

which reflects the market value of all stocks traded on the exchange. The

NASDAQ Composite Index also falls into this category, because the index

represents all stocks tracked by the Nasdaq system. The second group

includes the Dow Jones Composite Index and the S&P's stock indexes,

which are produced by other financial organizations.

Some indexes represent a broad segment of the overall stock market,

whereas others represent a particular sector, such as technology, energy, or

financials. In addition, because the notion of an equity investment style is

widely accepted in the investment community, some indexes are based on

either of the two equity styles: growth or value. As for growth versus value,

growth is the appellation applied to the stock of companies with high

earnings growth expectations. That is, the stock is expected to appreciate as

the company continues to generate future cash flow increments. In contrast,

a value strategy involves investing in stocks that have low expected earnings

growth and that the market has somehow undervalued. Other indexes have

separate indexes based on size (that is, on small, medium, or large market

capitalization stocks).

**`NYSE Composite Index`** The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
includes more than 2,000 stocks, of which approximately 1,600 are from the
United States and approximately 360 are foreign. These include American
depositary receipts (ADRs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and
foreign listings. The NYSE also provides subindexes on tech/media/telecom,
energy, financial, and healthcare. The NYSE uses a free-float market cap–
weighting method. These indexes are not widely used in practice.

**`NASDAQ Composite Index`** The NASDAQ Composite Index also falls into
the second group of stock market indicators. It includes all the stocks traded
by Nasdaq. The index includes ADRs, tracking stocks, and limited
partnership interests, but is heavily weighted toward information technology

stocks. It is market cap weighted. It is one of the most commonly followed

indexes in the U.S.

Nasdaq also provides the Nasdaq100 Index, which is based on 100 of the

largest nonfinancial companies traded on Nasdaq. Since the tech bubble in

1995–1999, this index has come to be known as the "technology index."

Nasdaq also provides less commonly used indexes based on industrials,

banks, insurance, other finance, telecommunications, and computers. The

Nasdaq100 and other subindexes are modified market cap–weighted indexes

(they use rules capping the influence of the largest stocks).

**`Dow Jones Industrial Average`** The DJIA originally included 30 large
and widely held industrial stocks. The companies included in the average are
those selected by Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the _Wall Street_
_Journal_ . The index now also includes technology, financial, and other sector
stocks. The company now also provides the Dow Jones Transportation
Average (20 stocks) and the Dow Jones Utility Average (15 stocks). The
most controversial aspect of the DJIA is that it is price weighted (it is the

- nly major index that is price weighted), most likely due to its early
development (in the 19th century). Although price weighted, the price is
adjusted for stock splits and other changes.

**`Standard & Poor’s 500 Index`** Also in the second group, the S&P 500
Index represents 500 large—not necessarily the 500 largest—stocks chosen
from the listings of the two major national stock exchanges (NYSE and
NASDAQ) and the OTC market. The stocks in the index at any given time
are determined by a committee of Standard & Poor's Corporation, which
may occasionally add or delete (on no prespecified schedule) individual
stocks or the stocks of entire industry groups. The committee has
considerable discretion in its choice. A free-float market cap–weighted index
is used. (The float is the number of shares available for public trading, not
the total number of shares outstanding.)

The S&P 500 is one of the most widely followed U.S. stock indexes and

is commonly used as an indicator of the stock market. Standard & Poor's

also provides indexes based on size and style. Their size indexes are the

Mid-Cap 400 and Small-Cap 600, which along with the large cap S&P 500,

provide the S&P Composite 1500, representing the entire stock market. S&P

also provides style indexes (growth and value) for each size category. These

subindexes are commonly used by investment professionals.

Neither the DJIA nor the S&P indexes have specific rules regarding

which stocks must be included in their indexes or the timing of changes; that

is, the composition of the indexes is not rules based. Thus, the composition

- f the indexes is determined by the discretion of the sponsor.

**`MSCI indexes`** MSCI Inc., formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International
(called "MSCI"), provides a family of U.S. and global stock indexes (as well
as fixed income and hedge fund indexes). The U.S. equity indexes are
provided in the following categories: Investible Market (2,500 stocks),
Prime Market Index (750 stocks), Large-Cap Index (300 stocks), Mid-Cap
450 Index (450 stocks), Small-Cap 1750 Index (1,750 stocks), and MicroCap Index.

**`Russell indexes`** Another family of nonexchange-sponsored U.S. stock
indexes is the Russell Family, Russell Inc. In this family of equity indexes,
the broad-based index is the Russell 3000, which is based on the largest
3000 stocks in the United States. The Russell 3000 index is divided into the

large cap Russell 1000 and the remaining small cap Russell 2000 Index.

These indexes are rebalanced annually, typically scheduled for the closing

prices on the last Friday in June. These market caps determine the largest

3,000 stocks and the break-up into the 1,000 and 2,000 stocks. This process

is called "reconstitution." This stock selection process is thus completely

rules based, unlike the discretionary Standard & Poor's and DJIA processes.

There are also growth and value versions of the Russell indexes. These

indexes are widely used in practice.

**`Wilshire indexes`** The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index (the Wilshire
5000), sponsored by Wilshire Associates (in Santa Monica, California), is
also a market cap–weighted index of most of the common stocks (including
REITs) actively traded on the NYSE and Nasdaq. As of year-end 2016, the
index had 3,618 stocks. This index has moderate use. Another Wilshire
index, the Wilshire 4,500 Completion Index, includes the stocks in the
Wilshire 5000 with the stocks in the S&P 500 removed.

In this regard, the number of publicly listed stocks has declined by

approximately 50% from 7,322 in 1996 to 3,671 in 2016. The major reasons

for this are that the delistings due primarily to mergers, acquisitions, and

private equity activity have exceeded initial public offerings.

**`CBOE Volatility Index`** Another index which has become very popular in
the equity markets is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX, which stands for
"volatility index"). The VIX is not a stock index, but it is a stock-related
index. The VIX is a measure of the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index

- ption, which is calculated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE) and used by stock traders. The VIX provides a measure of this

- ption's market expectation of the S&P 500 stock market volatility over the
next 30-day period. The VIX is quoted as a percentage, which is consistent
with its being a volatility. A high VIX measure indicates that the stock
market is expected to be very volatile and is regarded as a bearish signal. For
this reason, the VIX is regarded as a "fear index." Futures and options
contracts on the VIX are available from the CBOE.

Pricing Efficiency of the Stock Market

```

As explained in chapter 18, a price-efficient market is one in which the

security prices at all times fully reflect all available information relevant to

their valuation. When a market is price efficient, investment strategies

pursued to outperform a broad-based stock market index will not

consistently produce superior returns after adjusting for risk and transaction

costs.

Numerous studies have examined the pricing efficiency of the stock

market. Although it is not our intent in this chapter to provide a

comprehensive review of these studies, we can summarize their basic

findings and their implications for investment strategies.

```
Forms of Efficiency

```

The three different forms of pricing efficiency include (1) a weak form, (2) a

semi-strong form, and (3) a strong form. The distinctions among these forms

lie in the relevant information assumed to be taken into consideration in the

price of the security at all times. **Weak efficiency** means that the price of the

security reflects the past price and trading volume of the security. **Semi-**

**strong efficiency** means that the price of the security fully reflects all public

information, which includes (but is not limited to) historical price and

trading patterns. This information includes, importantly, the financial

information provided by the corporation to the SEC. **Strong efficiency**

exists in a market where the price of a security reflects all information,

whether it is publicly available or is known privately only to insiders, such

as the firm's managers or directors. Of course, using inside information may

be illegal.

The preponderance of empirical evidence supports the claims that the

common stock market is efficient in the weak form. The evidence emerges

from sophisticated tests that explore whether historical price movements can

be used to project future prices in such a way as to produce returns above

what one would expect from market movements and the risk class of the

security. Such returns are known as **positive abnormal returns** . The

implications are that investors who follow a strategy of selecting stocks

solely on the basis of price patterns or trading volume—such investors are

- ften referred to as **technical analysts** - r **chartists** - should not expect to do
better than the market. In fact, they may fare worse because of higher
transaction costs associated with frequent buying and selling of stocks.

The evidence is mixed on whether the stock market is price efficient in

the semi-strong form. Some studies support the proposition of efficiency

when they suggest that investors who select stocks on the basis of

**fundamental security analysis** - which consists of analyzing financial

statements, the quality of management, and the economic environment of a

company—will not outperform the market. This result is certainly

reasonable: so many analysts use the same approach, with the same publicly

available data, that the price of the stock remains in line with all the relevant

factors that determine value. In contrast, a sizable number of other studies

have produced evidence indicating instances and patterns of pricing

inefficiency in the stock market over long periods. Economists and financial

analysts often label these examples of inefficient pricing **anomalies in the**

**market**, that is, phenomena that cannot be easily explained and often persist.

Semi-strong efficiency remains controversial.

Empirical tests of the strong form of pricing efficiency fall into two

groups: (1) studies of the performance of professional money managers and

(2) studies of the activities of insiders (persons who are company directors,

major officers, or major stockholders). Studies of the performance of

professional money managers to test the strong form of pricing efficiency

are based on the belief that professional managers have access to better

information than is available to the general public. Whether this point is true

is moot, because the empirical evidence suggests professional managers do

not outperform the market consistently. In contrast, evidence based on the

activities of insiders generally reveals that this group often achieves higher

returns than does the stock market. Of course, insiders could not get those

high abnormal returns if the stock prices fully reflected all relevant

information about the values of the firms. Thus, the empirical evidence on

insider trading argues against the notion that the market is efficient in the

strong form sense. This activity is referred to **insider trading** and is not

legal.

**`Efficient market hypothesis and the random walk hypothesis`** The
efficient market hypothesis states that the market incorporates new
information completely and quickly. In an efficient market, stock prices
behave as if they followed a random walk (sometimes called a "drunken
sailor's walk"). According to the random walk hypothesis, at any time, it
cannot be determined whether prices will increase or decrease during the
next period.

Expressed mathematically, the next period's price, denoted by _Pt_ + 1, can

be expressed as the current period's price, denoted by _Pt_, plus a random error

term denoted by _et_ +1:

_Pt_ + 1 = _Pt_ + _et_ + 1.

The serial correlation coefficient is the correlation coefficient between _Pt_ +1

and _Pt_ . Statistically, the serial correlation coefficient (also called the

"autocorrelation coefficient") is the extent to which the price in one period is

related to the next period's price.

If the serial correlation coefficient is zero, the returns exhibit a random

walk relationship and are random. If the serial correlation is positive or

negative, the returns exhibit a relationship and have positive or negative

momentum, respectively. Based on annual returns for large cap and small

cap stocks, the serial correlation coefficients over the period 1926 to 2016

are both approximately zero (0.02 and 0.06, respectively). [1]

The efficient market hypothesis and the random walk hypothesis are

related but not identical. To be efficient, market prices must exhibit a

random walk as prices grope toward the efficient level. But prices could

exhibit a random walk without being efficient. A pricing model, in addition,

is necessary to determine the efficiency of a market. Thus, a random walk is

a necessary but not sufficient condition for market efficiency. Calculating the

degree of randomness in a series is simple, but determining the efficiency of

a market is difficult and remains a controversial topic.

Overall, if a market is highly price efficient, it is impossible to

- utperform the market consistently and, as a result, a passive strategy is
ideal. For active strategies to be appropriate, there must be inefficiencies in
market prices that can be exploited. Of course, these active strategies would
also have to cover transaction costs to be successful.

```
Micro versus Macro Stock Market Efficiency

```

Professor Paul Samuelson, the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic

Science, made the following comment about stock market efficiency:

Modern markets show considerable micro efficiency (for the reason that the minority who spot

aberrations from micro efficiency can make money from those occurrences and, in doing so, they tend

to wipe out any persistent inefficiencies). In no contradiction to the previous sentence, I had

hypothesized considerable macro inefficiency, in the sense of long waves in the time series of

aggregate indexes of security prices below and above various definitions of fundamental values. [2]

Basically, Samuelson argued that the efficient market hypothesis is likely to

work better for individual stocks than for the aggregate stock market. That

is, the stock market, according to Samuelson, is "micro efficient" but not

necessarily "macro inefficient." This view, referred to as "Samuelson's

dictum," has considerable empirical support. Studies have looked for

efficiency in the aggregate stock market and in various components of the

stock market, such as industries. [3] Inefficiencies in terms of pricing were

measured in these studies on the basis of excess volatility (i.e., volatility that

should not be excessive in an efficient market). The studies found that

inefficiencies existed at the aggregate stock market level (thereby providing

support for macro inefficiency) but not at the industry sector or the

individual security level (thereby providing support for micro efficiency).

```
Implications of Market Efficiency for Investing in Common Stock

```

Common stock investment strategies can be classified into two general

categories: active strategies and passive strategies. **Active investment**

**strategies** attempt to outperform the market by one or more of the following

methods: timing the selection of transactions, such as in the case of technical

analysis; identifying undervalued or overvalued stocks using fundamental

security analysis; and selecting stocks according to market anomalies.

Obviously, the decision to pursue an active strategy rests on the belief that

some type of gain can be made from such efforts, even after costs, but gains

are possible only if pricing inefficiencies exist. The particular strategy

chosen depends on what pricing inefficiencies the investor believes are

- ccurring.

Investors who believe that the market is pricing stocks efficiently should

accept the implication that attempts to outperform the market cannot be

systematically successful, except by luck. This implication does not mean

that investors should shun the stock market but instead suggests that they

should pursue a **passive investment strategy**, which is one that does not

attempt to outperform the market. Is there an optimal investment strategy for

someone who holds this belief in the pricing efficiency of the stock market

and thereby captures the risk premiums in the stock market? There is. Its

theoretical basis is modern portfolio theory and capital market theory, which

we discussed in chapter 13. According to modern portfolio theory, the

market portfolio offers the highest level of return per unit of risk in a market

that is price efficient. A portfolio of financial assets with characteristics

similar to those of a portfolio consisting of the entire market—the market

portfolio—will capture the pricing efficiency of the market.

But how can such a passive strategy be implemented? More specifically,

what is meant by a "market portfolio," and how should that portfolio be

constructed? In theory, the **market portfolio** consists of all financial assets,

not just common stock. The reason is that investors compare all investment

- pportunities, not just stock, when committing their capital. Thus, our
principles of investing must be based on capital market theory, not just stock
market theory. When the theory is applied to the stock market, the market
portfolio consists of a large universe of common stocks. But how much of
each common stock should be purchased when constructing the market
portfolio? Theory states that the chosen portfolio should be an appropriate
fraction of the market portfolio; hence the weighting of each stock in the
market portfolio should be based on its relative market capitalization. Thus,
if the aggregate market capitalization of all stocks included in the market
portfolio is $ _T_ and the market capitalization of one of these stocks is $ _A_,
then the fraction of this stock that should be held in the market portfolio is
$ _A_ /$ _T._

The passive strategy just described is called **indexing** . As evidence

mounted about the inability of many investment managers to outperform the

stock market on a risk-adjusted basis after transaction costs and fees, the

amount of funds managed using an indexing strategy grew substantially.

However, index funds still account for a relatively large and still-growing

fraction of institutional stock investments.

Traditionally, the benchmarks for indexing strategies have been one of

the broad-based market indexes designed around market capitalization

weighting, as described earlier in the chapter. However, there has been

increasing interest in the use of alternative benchmarks as a low-cost

strategy to capture the risk premiums in the stock market. This strategy is

referred to as a **smart beta strategy** . The underlying assumption of those

who support a smart beta strategy is that, in contrast to indexing, which

seeks to replicate the risk premiums embedded in an overall stock market

index, a smart beta strategy seeks to capture a risk premium of subsets of the

- verall stock market by means of a low-cost investment process. To do so, a
smart beta strategy requires the identification of systematic risk drivers of
stock returns to construct a benchmark (which is referred to as "smart beta")
that may offer a better risk/return profile than one of the traditional market
cap–weighted stock market indexes.

A hybrid of the pure passive and pure active approaches is the coresatellite strategy, wherein the overall portfolio has a core of large holdings in

passive, low-expense holdings in efficient asset classes and satellites around

the core consisting of small holdings of more expensive, active noncore

holdings.

```
Common Stock Investment Strategies

```

Investment strategies pursued by professional money managers can be

- rganized in several different ways. The most common method is to divide
strategies into two categories: passive and active, as introduced above.

To begin simply, assume that an investor's portfolio has _N_ stocks, _S_ 1, _S_ 2,

…, _S_ N. The investor wants to develop a portfolio of these _N_ stocks with

weights _WS_ 1, _WS_ 2, …, _WSN_ . Assume also that the investor has selected an

index _I_, which is used as a basis for the portfolio—the index has weights _IS_ 1,

_IS_ 2, …, _ISN_ .

A **passive portfolio**  - also called an **index portfolio**  - relative to the

index _I_ - is one in which: _WS_ 1 = _IS_ 1, _WS_ 2 = _IS_ 2, …, _WSN_ = _ISN_ . That is, _WSi_ =

_ISi_ for all _i_ . The weight of each stock in the portfolio is identical to its weight

in the index.

If this is the definition of a passive strategy, what is the definition of an

active strategy? The answer is "anything else." That is, at least two of the

weights in the portfolio must be different than the weights in the index

(obviously, one difference cannot occur alone). As a result, for a given set of

_N_ stocks, there is only one passive strategy, but there are an infinite number

- f active strategies. For _WSi_ ≠ _ISi_ (for any two or more _i_ ), the strategy is

active. [4]

Note that the return on a pure passive portfolio must equal the return on

the index (excluding expenses, which are considered below). Note also that

the return on any individual active portfolio may be greater or less than the

return on the index; that is, an individual active managed portfolio may

- utperform or underperform its index, respectively. As stated by William
Sharpe, the original findings on this topic are:

If "active" and "passive" management styles are defined in sensible ways; it _must_ be the case that:

(1) before costs, the return on the average actively managed dollar will equal the return on the average

passively managed dollar; and

(2) after costs, the return on the average actively managed dollar will be less than the return on the

average passively managed dollar.

These assertions hold for any time period. [5]

Basically, "passive" has a singular meeting—it means to match an index

exactly, both in composition and weights of the securities therein. But there

are many different types of active portfolios.

Traditionally, the two dominant active strategies have been "stock

picking" and "market timing." **Stock picking** means overweighting and/or

underweighting (including zero weights) some stocks relative to their index.

Equity analysts determine which stocks to overweight or underweight by

fundamental analysis. **Market timing** refers to shifting between high

expected return assets and low expected return assets, depending on the

degree of bullish and bearish beliefs of the investor, often shifting between

stocks and cash.

Between the polar extremes of passive and active strategies, there are

developments on a continuum of strategies based on their "degree of

activeness." [6] Some portfolios may deviate from their indexes significantly;

- thers only slightly.

The strategies addressed thus far have had only long positions, that is,

where stocks are purchased with cash. These are called "long-only"

strategies. Beginning with hedge funds, however, investors have also used

short positions. Short positions are achieved by borrowing a company's

stock from another party (for example, a broker), selling the stock, and then

using the cash from the sale to purchase additional stocks or let it remain in

cash. These are called **long-short strategies** . Overall, a long positon is a

bullish position; that is, the position profits if the stock price increases. A

short position is a bearish position; that is, a short position profits if the stock

price decreases. Consequently, long-short strategies can be either bullish or

bearish, depending on the identities and weights of the long and short

positions. [7]

```
Common Stock Trading Arrangements

```

Trading arrangements involve the types of orders placed by investors. We

begin with the types of orders, margin transactions, trading priority rules,

and transaction costs. We then discuss trading arrangements for retail trading

and those for institutional investors (block trades and program trades) for

coping with the trading needs of institutional investors.

```
Types of Orders

```

When an investor wants to buy or sell a share of common stock, the price

and conditions under which the order is to be executed must be

communicated to a broker. As explained in chapter 18, the simplest type of

- rder is the **market order**, an order to be executed at the best price available
in the market. If the stock is listed and traded on an organized exchange, the
best price is ensured by the exchange rule that when more than one order on
the same side of the buy/sell transaction reaches the market at the same time,
the order with the best price is given priority. Thus, buyers bidding a higher
price are given priority over those bidding a lower price, and sellers offering
a lower price are given priority over those offering a higher price.

Another priority rule of exchange trading is needed to handle the receipt

- f more than one order at the same price. Most often, the priority in
executing such orders is based on the time of arrival of the order—the first

- rders in are the first orders executed—although higher priority is given to
certain types of market participants over other types of market participants
seeking to transact at the same price. For example, on exchanges, orders may
be classified as either public orders or orders of those member firms dealing
for their own accounts (both nonspecialists and specialists). Exchange rules
require that public orders be given priority over orders of member firms
dealing for their own accounts.

The danger of a market order is that an adverse price movement may take

place between the time the investor places the order and the time the order is

executed. To avoid this danger, the investor can place a **limit order** that

designates a price threshold for the execution of the trade. A **buy limit order**

indicates that the stock may be purchased only at the designated price or

lower. A **sell limit order** indicates that the stock may be sold at the

designated price or higher. The key disadvantage of a limit order is that it

- ffers no guarantee that it will be executed at all; the designated price may
simply not be obtainable. A limit order that is not executable at the time it

reaches the market is recorded in a **limit order book**, as mentioned in the

chapter 22.

The limit order is a **conditional order** : It is executed only if the limit

price or a better price can be obtained. Another type of conditional order is

the **stop order**, which specifies that the order is not to be executed until the

market moves to a designated price, at which time it becomes a market

- rder. A **buy stop order** specifies that the order is not to be executed until
the market rises to a designated price, that is, until it trades at or above, or is
bid at or above, the designated price. A **sell stop order** specifies that the

- rder is not to be executed until the market price falls below a designated
price, that is, until it trades at or below, or is offered at or below, the
designated price. A stop order is useful when an investor cannot watch the
market constantly. Profits can be preserved or losses minimized on a stock
position by allowing market movements to trigger a trade. In a sell (buy)
stop order, the designated price is lower (higher) than the current market
price of the stock. In a sell (buy) limit order, the designated price is higher
(lower) than the current market price of the stock. The relationship between
the two types of conditional orders, and the market movements that trigger
them, appear in table 23.3.

Two dangers are associated with stop orders. Stock prices sometimes

exhibit abrupt price changes, so the direction of a change in a stock price

may be quite temporary, resulting in the premature trading of a stock. Also,

- nce the designated price is reached, the stop order becomes a market order
and is subject to the uncertainty of the execution price noted earlier for
market orders.

A **stop-limit order**, a hybrid of a stop order and a limit order, is a stop

- rder that designates a price limit. In contrast to the stop order, which
becomes a market order if the stop is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a
limit order if the stop is reached. The stop-limit order can be used to cushion
the market impact of a stop order. The investor may limit the possible
execution price after the activation of the stop. As with a limit order, the
limit price may never be reached after the order is activated, which therefore
defeats one purpose of the stop order—to protect a profit or limit a loss.

An investor may also enter a **market-if-touched order** . This order

becomes a market order if a designated price is reached. A market-if-touched

- rder to buy becomes a market order if the market falls to a given price,
whereas a stop order to buy becomes a market order if the market price rises

to a given price. Similarly, a market-if-touched order to sell becomes a

market order if the market rises to a specified price, whereas the stop order

to sell becomes a market order if the market falls to a given price. We can

think of the stop order as an order designed to get out of an existing position

at an acceptable price (without specifying the exact price) and the market-iftouched order as an order designed to get into a position at an acceptable

price (also without specifying the exact price).

Orders may be placed to buy or sell at the open or the close of trading for

the day. An **opening order** indicates a trade to be executed only in the

- pening range for the day, and a **closing order** indicates a trade is to be
executed only within the closing range for the day.

An investor may enter orders that contain order cancellation provisions.

A **fill-or-kill order** must be executed as soon as it reaches the trading floor

- r it is immediately canceled. Orders may designate the period for which the
- rder is effective—a day, week, or month, or perhaps by a given time within
the day. An **open order**, or **good until canceled order**, is good until the
investor specifically terminates the order.

An important type of order that is key in a trading strategy discussed later

(high-frequency trading) is a **flash order** . With a flash order, the trade must

be executed immediately or withdrawn if not executed immediately.

Orders are also classified by their size. One **round lot** is typically 100

shares of a stock. An **odd lot** is defined as less than a round lot. For

example, an order of 75 shares of Microsoft is an odd lot order. An order of

350 shares of Microsoft includes an odd lot portion of 50 shares. A **block**

**trade** is defined on the NYSE as an order of 10,000 shares of a given stock

- r a total market value of \$200,000 or more.

```
Margin Transactions

```

As explained in chapter 18, investors can borrow cash to buy securities and

use the securities themselves as collateral. A transaction in which an investor

borrows to buy shares using the shares themselves as collateral is referred to

as **buying on margin** . The funds borrowed to buy the additional stock will

be provided by the broker, and the broker gets the money from a bank. The

**call money rate** - r broker loan rate is the interest rate that banks charge

brokers for funds for this purpose. The broker charges the borrowing

investor the call money rate plus a service charge.

A brokerage firm is not free to lend as much as it wishes to the investor

to buy securities. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange

Act") prohibits brokers from lending more than a specified percentage of the

market value of the securities. The initial margin requirement is the

proportion of the total market value of the securities that the investor must

pay as an equity share, and the remainder is borrowed from the broker. The

Exchange Act gives the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Fed)

the responsibility to set initial margin requirements, which it does under

Regulations T and U. The Fed changes margin requirements as an

instrument of economic policy. The initial margin requirement was

previously below 40%; it is 50% as of this writing. Initial margin

requirements vary for stocks and bonds.

The Fed also establishes a maintenance margin requirement, which is the

minimum proportion of the equity in the investor's margin account to the

total market value. If the investor's margin account falls below the minimum

maintenance margin (which would happen if the share's price fell), the

investor is required to put up additional cash. The investor receives a margin

call from the broker specifying the additional cash to be put into the

investor's margin account. If the investor fails to put up the additional cash,

the broker has the authority to sell the securities for the investor's account.

Let us illustrate maintenance. Assume that an investor buys 100 shares of

stock at \$60 per share for \$6,000 of stock on 50% margin, and the

maintenance margin is 25%. By purchasing \$6,000 of stock on 50% margin,

the investor must put up \$3,000 in cash (or other equity) and thus borrows

\$3,000 (referred to as the **debit balance** ). The investor, however, must

maintain 25% of margin. To what level must the stock price decline to hit the

maintenance margin level? The price is \$40. At this price, the stock position

has a value of $4,000 ($40 × 100 shares). With a loan of \$3,000, the equity

in the account is $1,000 ($4,000 − \$3,000), or 25% of the account value

($1,000/$4,000 = 25%). If the price of the stock decreases below \$40, the

investor must deposit more equity to bring the equity level up to 25%. In

general, the account level has to decrease to 1.333 times the amount

borrowed (the debit balance) to hit the minimum maintenance margin level.

Margin practices also apply in short selling. Let's consider a similar

margin example for a short position. An investor shorts (borrows and sells)

100 shares of stock at \$60 for a total stock value of \$6,000. With an initial

margin of 50%, the investor must deposit \$3,000 (in addition to leaving the

\$6,000 from the sale in the account). So the investor has a credit balance of

\$9,000 (which does not change with the stock price, because it is in cash).

However, the investor owes 100 shares of the stock at the current market

price. To what level must the stock price increase to hit the maintenance

margin level, assumed to be 30% (which is the equity in the account as a

percentage of the market value of the stock)? The answer is \$69.23, for a

total stock value of \$6,923. If the stock is worth \$6,923, the account contains

\$2,077 of equity ($9,000 − $6,923), which represents 30% of the market

value of the stock ($2,077/$6,923 = 30%). The value of the stock that

triggered the maintenance level is calculated by multiplying the credit

balance by 10/13 (10/13 × $9,000 = $6,923).

```
Trading (Transaction) Costs

```

Investment managers must meet performance standards, which are typically

based on the total rate of return of their portfolios. The returns on their

portfolios are net of transaction (or trading) costs. One-half of one

percentage point in return can substantially affect a manager's record.

Therefore, an important aspect of an investment strategy is controlling the

transaction costs necessary to implement the strategy. The measurement of

trading costs, although important, is difficult. [8]

Institutional investors have developed computer-automated programs to

enter trading orders to minimize the costs associated with trading, which we

discuss below. The use of computer programs for this purpose is known as

**algorithmic trading** . Once an institutional investor makes a decision to buy

- r sell a large stock position, the program partitions the trade into several
smaller orders to minimize transaction costs.

We begin by defining trading costs. Trading costs can be decomposed

into two major components: explicit costs and implicit costs. **Explicit**

**trading costs** are the direct costs of trading, such as broker commissions,
fees, and taxes. **Implicit trading costs** represent such indirect costs as the
price impact of the trade and the opportunity costs of failing to execute in a
timely manner or at all. Whereas explicit costs are associated with
identifiable accounting charges, no such reporting of implicit costs occurs.

**`Explicit costs`** The main explicit cost is the commission paid to the
broker for execution. Commission costs are fully negotiable and vary
systematically by broker type and market mechanism. The commission may
depend on both the price per share and the number of shares in the
transaction. In addition to commissions, other explicit costs include custodial
fees (the fees charged by an institution that holds securities in safekeeping
for an investor) and transfer fees (the fees associated with transferring an
asset from one owner to another).

Competition and computer technology have driven down the bid-ask

spread for stocks to as little as one penny per share. The decline in explicit

trading costs began with the elimination of fixed commissions by the SEC

- n May 1, 1975, commonly called "May Day." After this date, trading fees
were set by market competition. Prior to 2001, stock prices were quotes in
increments of one-eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 cents. In 2001, the SEC
eliminated this pricing practice and moved to decimalization, which resulted
in the spreads declining to as little as one penny per share. In the opinion of
some analysts, the impact of decimalization compares to that of the end of
fixed commissions.

**`Implicit costs  Implicit trading costs`** include impact costs, timing
costs, and opportunity costs.

The **impact cost**  - f a transaction is the change in market price resulting

from supply/demand imbalances caused by the presence of the trade. Bidask spread estimates, although informative, fail to capture the fact that large

trades—those that exceed the number of shares the market maker is willing

to trade at the quoted bid and ask prices—may move prices in the direction

- f the trade. That is, large trades may increase the price for buy orders and
decrease the price for sell orders. The resulting market impact or price
impact of the transaction can be thought of as the deviation of the transaction

price from the "unperturbed price" that would prevail if the trade did not

- ccur. Crossing networks, discussed in chapter 22, are designed to minimize
impact costs.

**Timing cost** is measured as the price change between the time the parties
to the implementation process assume responsibility for the trade and the
time they complete the trade. Timing costs occur when orders sit on the
trading desk of a buy-side firm (e.g., an investment management firm) but
are not yet released to the broker, because the trader fears that the trade may
swamp the market.

**Opportunity cost** is the "cost" of securities not traded. This cost results
from missed or only partially completed trades. These costs are the natural
consequence of the release delays. For example, if the price moves too much
before the trade can be completed, the manager will not make the trade. In
practice, this cost is measured on shares not traded, based on the difference
between the market price at the time of decision and the closing price 30
days later.

Although commissions and impact costs are actual and visible out-ofpocket costs, opportunity costs and timing costs are the costs of forgone

- pportunities and are invisible. Opportunity costs can arise for two reasons.
First, some orders are executed with a delay, during which the price moves
against the investor. Second, some orders incur an opportunity cost, because
they are only partially filled or are not executed at all.

**`Research on trading costs`** Overall, although the trading commission is
the most obvious, measurable, and discussed trading cost, it is only one of
the four types of trading costs and, in fact, may be the smallest. The implicit
trading costs, however, are much more difficult to measure.

Studies about transaction costs allow us to draw several conclusions:

1. Although considerable debate still surrounds how to measure trading
costs, the consensus is that implicit trading costs are economically
significant relative to explicit costs (and also relative to realized
portfolio returns).

2. Equity trading costs vary systematically with trade difficulty and

   - rder-placement strategy.

3. Differences in market design, investment style, trading ability, and
reputation are important determinants of trading costs.

4. Even after researchers control for trade complexity and trade venue,
trading costs vary considerably across managers.

5. The accurate prediction of trading costs requires more detailed data

   - n the entire order-submission process than are available, especially
information on pre-trade decision variables.

```
Trading Arrangements for Institutional Investors

```

With the increase in trading by institutional investors, trading arrangements

more suitable to these investors have developed. Institutional investors'

needs include trading in large size and trading groups of stocks, both at a

low commission and with low market impact. These requirements resulted in

the evolution of special arrangements for the execution of certain types of

- rders commonly sought by institutional investors: (1) orders requiring the
execution of a trade of many shares of a given stock and (2) orders requiring
the execution of trades in many different stocks as simultaneously as
possible. The former types of trades are called **block trades** ; the latter are
called **program trades** . An example of a block trade would be a mutual
fund that seeks to buy 15,000 shares of Apple Inc. stock. An example of a
program trade would be a pension fund that wants to buy shares of 200
companies at the end of a trading day.

The institutional arrangement that accommodates these two types of

institutional trades is a network of trading desks of the major securities firms

and other institutional investors that communicate with one another by

means of electronic display systems and telephones. This network is referred

to as the "upstairs market." Participants in the upstairs market play a key role

(1) by providing liquidity to the market so that such institutional trades can

be executed and (2) through arbitrage activities that help integrate the

fragmented stock market.

**`Block trades`** On the NYSE, Rule 72 defines a **block** as either trades of at
least 10,000 shares of a given stock or trades of shares with a market value

- f at least \$200,000, whichever is less. For institutional investors, because
the execution of large numbers of block orders places strains on the

specialist system, the NYSE implemented special procedures to handle

them. Typically, an institutional customer contacts its salesperson at a

brokerage firm, indicating that it wishes to place a block order. The

salesperson then gives the order to the brokerage firm's block execution

department. It should be noted that the salesperson does not submit the order

to be executed to the exchange where the stock might be traded or, in the

case of an unlisted stock, try to execute the order on the Nasdaq system.

The sales traders in the block execution department then contact other

institutions to attempt to find one or more institutions that would be willing

to take the other side of the order. That is, they use the upstairs market in

their search to fill the block trade order. If the sales traders cannot find

enough institutions to take the entire block (e.g., if the block trade order is

for 30,000 shares of Apple Inc., but only 25,000 can be "crossed" with other

institutions), then the balance of the block trade order is given to the firm's

market maker. The market maker must then decide how to handle the

balance of the block trade order. The brokerage firm can take a position in

the stock and buy the shares for its own account. Or the unfilled order can be

executed by using the services of competing market makers. In the former

case, the brokerage firm is committing its own capital.

NYSE Rule 127 states that if a member firm receives an order for a large

block of stock that might not be readily absorbed by the market, the member

firm should nevertheless explore the market on the floor, including, where

appropriate, consulting the specialist as to the specialist's interest in the

security. If a member firm intends to cross a large block of stock for a public

account at a price that is outside the current quotation, it should inform the

specialist of its intention.

NYSE block volume is facilitated by upstairs traders, but it is not the case

that all block trades are facilitated by upstairs trading desks and then brought

to the floor to be printed. There is a difference between upstairs-facilitated

trades and block trades. A block trade is defined by its size, not by the

method of execution. Although negotiation in the informal upstairs market

provides better execution than does execution in the downstairs market (i.e.,

- n the NYSE trading floor) for large trades, these differences are
economically small.

**`Program trades  Program trades`** involve the buying or selling large
numbers of stocks simultaneously. Such trades are also called **basket trades**,
because effectively, a "basket" of stock is being traded. The NYSE defines a
program trade as any trade involving the purchase or sale of a basket of at
least 15 stocks with a total value of \$1 million or more.

The two major applications of program trades are asset allocation and

index arbitrage. With respect to asset allocation trades, some examples of

why an institutional investor may want to use a program trade are to deploy

new cash into the stock market; to implement a decision to move funds

invested in the bond market to the stock market, or vice versa; and to

rebalance the composition of a stock portfolio because of a change in

investment strategy. For example, a mutual fund money manager can move

funds quickly into or out of the stock market for an entire portfolio of stocks

through a single program trade. All these strategies relate to asset allocation.

Program trading is also used for a strategy called **index arbitrage** . In

chapter 33, we will discuss futures contracts traded on stock indexes, called

"stock index futures." In chapter 35, we will discuss how the price of a

futures contract derives from the underlying cash product. In the case of a

stock index futures contract, the underlying cash product includes all of the

stocks making up the stock index. Specifically, a mathematical relationship

exists between the price of the stock index and the value of the stocks

included in the index, taking into account transaction costs and the cost of

borrowing funds. This relationship establishes bounds for the price of the

stock index futures contract. When the price of the stock index futures

contract moves outside these bounds, an opportunity arises for riskless

profits to be obtained by trading the stocks in the index and the futures

contract.

Unfortunately, the popular press often uses the terms "program trading"

and "index arbitrage" interchangeably, which is incorrect. One is an

investment strategy (index arbitrage), and the other is an institutional trading

arrangement (program trading), even though a program trade is necessarily

employed to implement an index arbitrage.

Another confusion is worth noting. Because computers are used to

execute a program trade, the popular press often wrongly characterizes

program trading as computerized trading. Program trading does not have to

be, and generally is not, computer initiated. Sometimes computer algorithms

facilitate the decision process, and almost always computers help route the

trade to each individual stock in the program, but traders make the decisions

and implement them.

```
High-Frequency Trading

```

One of the most significant market developments in recent years, according

to the SEC, is **high-frequency trading** (HFT). [9] HFT is a form of trading that

leverages high-speed computing, high-speed communications, tick-by-tick

data, and technological advances to execute trades in as little as

milliseconds. High-speed trading strategies use computerized quantitative

models (i.e., algorithms) that identify which stocks to buy or sell, as well as

the quantity, price, timing, and location of the trades. HFT was first applied

to the stock market. Today, however, it is also used in the bond market and

the derivatives markets. Our focus here is on its use in the stock market. The

SEC estimates that HFT is typically more than 50% of the total volume in

U.S.-listed equities, concluding that "by any measure, HFT is a dominant

component of the current market structure and likely to affect nearly all

aspects of its performance." [10]

There is no universally accepted definition of HFT. Martin Wheatley,

chief executive officer of the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong

Kong and former deputy chief executive of the London Stock Exchange,

defines HFT as "the execution of trading strategies based on computer

programmes or algorithms to capture opportunities that may be small or

exist for a very short period of time." [11] Four characteristics that Wheatley

identifies as being associated with HFT are (1) a high volume of trades on a

daily basis, with a low level of profits per trade; (2) an extremely short stock

holding period; (3) the submission of numerous orders; and (4) no

significant open position overnight. How to quantify these characteristics is

a matter of debate. One proposed definition is to define high-frequency

traders (HFTers) as those traders who hold positions between 10

milliseconds and 10 seconds. [12] Execution times are often expressed in

microseconds. However, the SEC adopts a somewhat less precise definition,

defining HFTers as professionals acting in a proprietary capacity and able to

generate many trades per day.

There is considerable controversy over HFT's impact on financial

markets in terms of the cost of trading to investors. Two events brought the

issue of HFT to the forefront of the investing public's and regulators'

attention. The first was the severe market disruption that occurred on May 6,

2010, as a result of HFT, known as the "flash crash." On the afternoon of

that trading day, the major stock market indexes (as well as the stock index

futures contracts, described in chapter 33) had declined by 4% relative to

their closing price on the prior trading day. This decline came about because

- f the news at the opening of trading about the European debt crisis. In a
matter of minutes, the stock market index dropped by 5% to 6%. But that
loss was not sustained. Almost as quickly, the market rebounded, ending the
trading day with a loss of 3% from the prior trading day. [13] The descriptor
"flash" used to describe the crash refers to the fact that the orders placed
were flash orders (i.e., orders that are executed immediately or withdrawn if
not executed immediately).

The second was the publication in March 2014 of Michael Lewis's book

_Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,_ dealing with HFT, which concluded that

the stock market is rigged by HFT investors. This set off a barrage of

criticisms of Lewis and other opponents of HFT because of their failure to

understand the wide range of trading activities in which HFT is used. This is

not to say that the concerns over certain types of trading strategies used by

HFTers were not legitimate. However, a blanket statement about the adverse

market impacts of HFT per se reflected a failure to understand the various

uses of HFT. As noted by BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset

management firm, in a position paper on HFT, some of these uses are

constructive in the market: They have a legitimate purpose and provide

benefits to market participants. Other users of HFT deploy it "to manipulate

the market or disadvantage end-investors." BlackRock refers to such use as

"predatory" HFT, stating that these "practices constitute market abuse and

should be treated as such in law." [14]

How does HFT differ from what we referred to as "program trading,"

discussed earlier? Both use algorithmic trading with no human intervention.

The difference lies in the use of algorithmic trading by an institutional

investor for orders that are so large that, if executed at one time, they would

have an excessive price impact. That is a legitimate use of rapid, algorithmic

trading. A computer algorithm in that case merely breaks up the order into

many smaller orders, which are fed into the marketplace over time. The SEC

recognizes that "these large order algorithms should not be classified as HFT

because they typically enable institutional investors to establish or liquidate

positions with time horizons far beyond the primarily intraday horizons

characteristic of HFT." [15]

HFT is engaged in by a wide variety of entities, including electronic

market makers, proprietary desks, hedge funds, and institutional investors.

Many of these firms are privately held proprietary trading firms or hedge

funds. The biggest players in HFT reportedly include the electronic market

makers and the proprietary trading desks of large banks. The technology

goal of HFTers is to reduce latency (i.e., delay) in placing, filling,

confirming, or canceling orders; the business goal is typically to profit from

small arbitrage opportunities present at short time horizons.

The SEC classifies HFT strategies according to strategy:

    _Passive market-making strategy:_ A passive market-making strategy

primarily involves the submission of orders by electronic market

makers that cannot be executed immediately, because the order seeks a

price better than that available in the market. Such orders provide

liquidity to the marketplace at specified prices. As such, they are quite

different from flash orders and do not depend on the direction of the

market.

    _Arbitrage strategies:_ Arbitrage strategies generally seek to capture

pricing disparities between related products or markets. An example is

index arbitrage, described earlier, in which an investor seeks to capture

pricing discrepancies between the cash equity market and stock index

futures market. These strategies depend on the convergence of prices

rather than on directional price movements.

    _Structural trading strategies:_ Structural trading strategies seek to

exploit structural vulnerabilities in the market. An example is a trader

who has access to lowto lowest-latency market data and computer

algorithms and who can profit by trading with market participants on a

trading venue that is offering executions at stale prices.

    _Directional trading strategies:_ Such strategies generally entail taking

a long or a short position in the market in anticipation of a directional

price movement (i.e., either an up or a down movement). There are two

types of directional strategies: (1) an order anticipation strategy, which

seeks to uncover the existence of large buyers or sellers in the

marketplace and then front-run those trades in anticipation that those

large orders will move market prices, and (2) a momentum ignition

strategy, which seeks to create a rapid price movement by initiating a

series of orders and trades.

BlackRock, for example, regards the use of HFT for passive market

making a type of HFT that "brings tangible benefits to our clients through

tighter spreads and by delivering intermediation in a fragmented trading

landscape." [16] In this chapter, we have already described the need for

arbitrage activities to maintain an efficient market. The concerns

surrounding HFT have mostly to do with directional trading and structural

trading strategies. A structural trading strategy in which HFTers use

information advantages obtained from special access to market data is the

best example of a predatory HFT strategy. Many of the directional trading

strategies, as the SEC notes, are not new. Instead, it is the technology that

gives HFTers pursuing directional trading strategies the opportunity to better

identify and execute trading strategies. Even prior to HFT, front-running

(using order-anticipation strategies) and market manipulation (using

momentum-ignition strategies) were illegal.

The failure of lawmakers to understand the various types of HFT

strategies and program trading strategies has led to proposals to impose

regulations to limit the impact of HFT. One such proposal that is most often

suggested as an effective way to limit the impact of HFT entails the

imposition of a _financial transaction tax_ . The problem with such a tax is that

by attempting to mitigate the potential impact of predatory HFT, it would

significantly reduce trading volume, liquidity, and price discovery, thereby

dramatically affecting all market participants. Some have argued that one

effective way to reduce the adverse impact of predatory HFT already exists:

the use of circuit breakers, which we discussed in chapter 22.

One way to address the speed-advantage issue available to HFTers

relative to other investors is by providing access to data centers and colocation at a reasonable cost. Co-location is one of the tools used by

proprietary firms that engage in HFT. To further reduce latency, HFTers

place their trading servers at the trading venues to be close to the exchange

matching engines. This is commonly referred to as "co-location." Carol

Clark, a financial markets and payments system risk specialist in the

Chicago Federal Reserve's financial market group, remarks that it is

estimated that for each 100 miles the server is located away from the

matching engine, 1 millisecond of delay is added to the time it takes to

transmit trade instructions and execute matched trades or to access the

central order book, where information on buy/sell quotations and current

market prices is warehoused. A trading venue that operates its own data

centers, as well as third parties that host matching engines of trading venues,

- ffer co-location as a service. For example, the NYSE completed a nearly
400,000-square-foot data center facility in Mahwah, New Jersey, to attract in
co-location large Wall Street banks, traditional brokerages, and hedge funds.
The center's 40 gigabyte per second standard hardware will allow it to
handle up to a million messages a second; new trading technology will
reduce latency to 10 microseconds. The SEC is undertaking an analysis of
the impact of co-location on long-term investors and market quality.

A survey paper by Charles Jones at the Columbia Business School

delivered the following conclusion about HFT:

Based on the vast majority of the empirical work to date, HFT and automated, competing markets

improve market liquidity, reduce trading costs, and make stock prices more efficient. Better liquidity

lowers the cost of equity capital for firms, which is an important positive for the real economy. Minor

regulatory tweaks may be in order, but those formulating policy should be especially careful not to

reverse the liquidity improvements of the last twenty years. [17]

Key Points

```

- Common stock is typically classified based on market capitalization; the
three most common classes are small, medium, and large market
capitalizations.

- In addition to market capitalization, a universe of common stocks can
be classified as either value or growth stocks based on their price-tobook value ratio.

- Stock market indexes can be classified into two groups: (1) those
produced by stock exchanges and include all stocks to be traded on the
exchange, and (2) those for which a committee subjectively selects the
stocks to be included in the index.

- Some indexes represent a broad segment of the stock market, whereas
- thers represent a particular sector, such as technology, energy (oil and
gas), and financials.

- Three forms of pricing efficiency follow according to what is
hypothesized to be the relevant information embodied in the price of a
stock at all times: (1) weak form, (2) semi-strong form, and (3) strong
form.

- Most of the empirical evidence appears to suggest that markets are
efficient in the weak form.

- The evidence for the semi-strong form of market efficiency is mixed
because of observed pockets of inefficiency. Empirical tests of strongform pricing efficiency also produce conflicting results.

- Paul Samuelson's dictum asserts that the stock market is "micro

efficient" but not necessarily "macro inefficient."

- Common stock investment strategies can be classified into two
general categories: active strategies and passive strategies.

- Active strategies attempt to outperform the market by one or more of
the following: timing the selection of transactions, such as in the case of
technical analysis; identifying undervalued or overvalued stocks using
fundamental security analysis; or selecting stocks according to market
anomalies.

- The optimal strategy to pursue when the stock market is perceived to
be price efficient is passive indexing, because it allows the investor to
capture the efficiency of the market.

- Smart beta is an alternative low-cost passive strategy that has been
suggested for capturing the risk premiums in the stock market that

cannot be captured by market capitalization–weighted indexes.

- A core-satellite strategy is a hybrid of the pure passive and pure
active approaches.

- According to the random walk hypothesis, at any time, it cannot be
determined whether prices will increase or decrease during the next
period.

- Different types of orders may be submitted to the stock markets.
- The most common type of order is a market order—an order that
must be filled immediately at the best price.

- Other types of orders, such as stop and limit orders, are filled only if
the market price reaches a price specified in the order.

- For a flash order, the trade must be executed immediately or
withdrawn if not executed immediately. These orders are used by
certain types of high-frequency traders.

- Several components of costs are associated with trading.
- Although a brokerage commission is the most obvious type of trading
cost and the object of competition among broker-dealers for both
institutional and retail investors, other types of trading costs may
exceed the brokerage commission. Such costs include impact costs and

- pportunity costs.
- Block trades are trades of 10,000 shares or more of a given stock or
trades with a market value of \$200,000 or more.

- Program trades, or basket trades, involve the buying or selling of
large numbers of names (stocks) simultaneously. The institutional
arrangement developed to accommodate these needs is the upstairs
market, which is a network of trading desks of the major securities
firms and institutional investors that communicate with one another by
means of electronic display systems and telephones.

- Buying on margin is a transaction in which an investor borrows to
buy shares using the shares themselves as collateral.

- In a margin transaction, the funds borrowed to buy the additional
stock are provided by the broker, and the investor is charged the call
money rate or broker loan rate to borrow the funds.

- Institutional investors have developed automated computer programs
to enter trading orders to minimize the costs associated with trading.
The use of computer programs for this purpose is known as algorithmic
trading.

- Trading costs can be decomposed into explicit costs and implicit

costs.

- Explicit trading costs are the direct costs of trading, such as broker
commissions, fees, and taxes.

- Implicit trading costs represent such indirect costs as the price impact
- f the trade and the opportunity costs of failing to execute in a timely
manner or at all.

- The main explicit cost is the commission paid to the broker for
execution.

- Implicit trading costs include impact costs, timing costs, and
- pportunity costs
- The impact cost of a transaction is the change in market price
resulting from supply/demand imbalances caused by the trade.

- Timing cost is measured as the price change between the time the
parties to the implementation process assume responsibility for the
trade and the time they complete the trade; it is the result of orders
remaining on the trading desk of an investor that have not yet been
released to the broker because the trader fears that the trade may swamp
the market.

- Opportunity cost is the "cost" of securities not traded as a result of
missed trades or only partially completed trades.

- Explicit trading costs are often the smallest components of trading

costs.

- Because of the significant increase in trading by institutional
investors, trading arrangements more suitable to these investors
developed: block trading and program trades.

- Block trading and program trades allow institutional investors the
- pportunity to trade in large size and trading groups of stock at a low
commission and with low market impact.

   - Block trades allow for orders requiring the execution of a trade of
many shares of a given stock.

   - Program trades allow for orders requiring the execution of trades in
many different stocks as simultaneously as possible.

   - High-frequency trading (HFT) is a form of trading that leverages
high-speed computing, high-speed communications, tick-by-tick data,
and technological advances to execute trades in as little as milliseconds
using computerized quantitative models (i.e., algorithms) that identify
which stocks to buy or sell, as well as the quantity, price, timing, and
location of the trades.

   - Four characteristics of HFT are (1) a high volume of trades on a daily
basis with a low level of profits per trade, (2) an extremely short stock
holding period, (3) the submission of numerous orders, and (4) no
significant open position overnight.

   - There is considerable controversy over HFT's impact on financial
markets in terms of the cost of trading to investors.

   - The SEC classifies HFT strategies into four categories: passive
market-making strategies, arbitrage strategies, structural trading
strategies, and directional trading strategies.

   - Latency means "speed" and refers to the time it takes to complete an
execution. HFTers refer to latency in milliseconds and even
microseconds.

12. The following quotation is taken from Wayne H. Wagner:

When a trader decides how to bring an order to the market, he or she must deal with some very

important issues; to me, the most important is: What kind of trade is this? It could be either an active

- r a passive trade. The type of trade will dictate whether speed of execution is more or less important
than cost of execution. In other words, do I want immediate trading (a market order); or am I willing
to forgo the immediate trade for the possibility of trading less expensively if I am willing to "give" on
the timing of the trade (a limit order)? [18]

There are three components of trading costs. First there are direct costs which may be measured—

commissions. Second, there are indirect—or market impact—costs. Finally, there are the undefined

costs of not trading. [19]

a. What are market impact costs, and what do you think the "undefined

costs of not trading" represent?

Market impact, unlike broker commissions, is difficult to identify and measure.

b. Why is market impact cost difficult to measure?

19. The following statement appears in a report to the Joint Advisory
Committee on Emerging Regulatory Issues, September 30, 2010:

Generally, a customer has a number of alternatives as to how to execute a large trade. First, a customer

may choose to engage an intermediary, who would, in turn, execute a block trade or manage the

position. Second, a customer may choose to manually enter orders into the market. Third, a customer

can execute a trade via an automated execution algorithm, which can meet the customer's needs by

taking price, time or volume into consideration. Effectively, a customer must make a choice as to how

much human judgment is involved while executing a trade. [20]

Explain each of these alternatives for executing a large trade.

20. Charles Schwab, chairman of the brokerage firm Charles Schwab
Corporation, came out with the following statement in support of the
conclusion in Michael Lewis's book _Flash Boys_ that markets are rigged
because of high-frequency trading: "High-frequency trading is a
growing cancer that needs to be addressed." He concluded that HFT "is
a technological arms race designed to pick the pockets of legitimate
market participants," and "a scam … that [regulators] should simply
make illegal." Explain whether you agree or disagree with this

statement.

21. In an invited editorial appearing in _The Journal of Portfolio_
_Management_, the founder of Vanguard, John Bogle, made the following
two statements about Michael Lewis's book _Flash Boys_ .

a. Explain whether you agree or disagree with the following statement.

_Flash Boys_, by best-selling author Michael Lewis, regaled the financial community with its polemic

- n the rise of HFT. "The stock market is rigged," Lewis told the huge television audience watching _60_

_Minutes_, without explaining precisely what that meant. "Wall Street has gone insane," he intoned to

the _Guardian_, which described his view that his calling is "a moral crusade." But he seems to have

largely ignored the vital role of HFT in reducing the frictional costs of trading to minuscule levels.

Lewis is particularly strident on the harm HFT does to ordinary individual investors. But it is here that

he seems most clearly wrong. Yes, he sees lots of smoke in HFT, but finds the most fire is where that

smoke is virtually absent. Retail investors who trade for themselves are beneficiaries of the new

trading environment, with lower trading costs and faster market access. [21]

b. What are the "well-founded concerns" that Mr. Bogle refers to in the

following statement?

HFT is a long way from perfection. There are well-founded concerns—and heated arguments pro and

con—about front-running by insiders (based largely on knowledge of pending transactions); huge

volumes of cancelled orders (from HFT firms, as well as others); those mysterious dark pools; and

- utlandish profits earned by HFT firms.

6. A recently developed concept, "active share," is a metric that is the percentage difference between
the individual holdings of a portfolio and its benchmark; it has been used to measure the degree of
difference from the index. For example, an active share of 70% of a portfolio (by market cap) deviates
from its index and 30% is consistent with its index. See Antti Petojisto and Martijn Cremers, "How

7. Long-short strategies in general and hedge funds, in particular, comprise a wide variety of
strategies of various degrees of activeness. These include, for example: market neutral strategy (long
and short positions offset each other completely in market risk), 130% /30% strategy (portfolio
includes 130% long positions and 30% short positions), and bear market strategy (short positions more
than completely offset the long positions).

Learning Objectives

```

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the motivation for investors investing outside their domestic stock
market;

   - what the major changes in global exchanges in the past two decades
have been;

   - the major non-U.S. stock market indexes;
   - the U.K. and European stock market regulatory systems;
   - the implications of the United Kingdom's Big Bang;
   - the structure and regulation of the Chinese stock market;
   - the three major stock exchanges in China—Shanghai, Shenzhen, and
Hong Kong—and their differences;

   - the role of state-owned enterprises in the development of the Chinese
economy and in the Chinese stock market; and

   - the differences between A-shares, B-shares, and H-shares traded on
the Chinese stock exchanges.

In the previous two chapters, our focus was on the various aspects of the

U.S. equity markets. We complete this three-chapter suite with a treatment of

the non-U.S. equity markets. This chapter begins with a review of the nonU.S. equity markets—developed, emerging (developing), and frontier (preemerging) markets. Because the Chinese equity markets are relatively young

but are very large, growing quickly, and quite complicated, we discuss the

Chinese equity markets in more detail.

Although non-U.S. equities have become a large component of the

investment portfolio of many institutional investors, retail (individual)

investors can also invest in these markets. As can be seen in table 24.1

below, North America (the United States and Canada [1] ) represented

approximately 44% of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Global

All Cap Index as of April 30, 2017. Most individual investors do not

typically trade non-U.S. stocks directly but instead obtain exposure via

collective vehicles that invest in individual countries or regions (such as

mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) and depositary receipts (ADRs and

GDRs).

Rationale for Investing Outside the Home Equity Market

```

Investors have a choice of investing solely in their home equity market or

expanding their portfolio to include the stocks of companies outside their

home market. For example, a French investor can invest solely in stocks of

French companies and traded in the French stock market or can invest in not

- nly French companies but also in companies trading in other European
countries, Asian companies, and North American companies. Why do
investors bother to invest outside their home equity market? There are
several reasons for doing do.

The major reason that is often cited is that investing in the companies

- utside their home market is diversification. Recall our discussion in chapter
13, where we described the Markowitz efficient frontier and how that

efficient frontier impacted the correlation between assets. The argument for

investing outside the home market is that the stock market return

correlations are less than one and therefore, there is the opportunity to "push

- ut" the efficient frontier. "Pushing out the efficient frontier" means that a
given level of expected return can be achieved at a lower level of risk.
Economists have argued that this is a "free lunch." Whether they are right is
an empirical question. Some studies support correlation levels between
country stock market returns that can produce this outcome. However, other
studies show that as the world has become more integrated, correlations have
approached one, particularly during a financial crisis.

The second rationale is that there are different levels of market efficiency

in different countries. Hence, although the home equity market may or may

not offer the opportunity to obtain superior returns due to market

inefficiency, there are countries that may be far less efficient.

However, investing outside one's home market opens an investor to other

issues that must be considered, such as liquidity, taxation, and other types of

risk (specifically, different credit risks, country risk, and currency risk).

```
Non-U.S. Equity Markets

```

Table 24.1 shows the composition of the global equity markets according to

a well-known global stock market index, the Financial Times Stock

Exchange (FTSE) Global All Cap Index, as of April 30, 2017.

As explained in chapter 1, countries and their equity markets are typically

divided into three categories: developed, emerging (developing), and frontier

(pre-emerging). The differences among these three types are based mainly

- n two factors: the development of their economies and the development of
their capital markets. [2] Their economic development refers mainly to their per
capita income and their potential growth. Developed countries have higher
levels of per capita income but lower potential growth. The development of
their capital markets refers to the size of their market capitalization, the level

- f liquidity, and the development of their supporting regulatory and legal
bodies. These characteristics affect the growth potential, risk, and liquidity

- f investments in their markets. Developed countries are found mostly in
North America, Western Europe, and Australasia, including the United

States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and

Japan.

An emerging (developing) market is a country that has some of the

characteristics of a developed market but not all of them. Developing

countries include the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China); and the

PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain). As shown in table 24.1,

emerging market companies comprise 8.9% of the FTSE Global All Cap

Index, with 2.2% in China, 1.5% in Taiwan, 1.2% in India, and 4.0% in other

emerging markets. Notice that North America (the United States and

Canada) represents 56.1% of the global equity market, the other developed

countries (Europe and the Pacific) represent 34.8%, and emerging market

countries represent 8.9%. The Middle East represents the final 0.22%.

A frontier or pre-emerging market is one that is too small and

undeveloped to be considered an emerging market. These markets are

smaller, less liquid, and less accessible than emerging markets, but

nevertheless "investable." These markets tend to have high expected long

run returns and low correlations with other markets. There are 21 markets

that MSCI considers frontier markets, as shown in table 24.2.

Overall, less-developed countries have higher risks and higher potential

returns, not an unusual trade-off when investing in financial markets.

There are several methods for classifying stock markets. In this chapter,

we use the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) market

classification, which is a family of indexes constructed and maintained by

that organization. Its structure and current data are provided in table 24.2. [3]

MSCI's broadest index is the MSCI ACWI Index (ACWI stands for "All

Country World Index"). As shown, this broad index is divided into the

categories of developed markets, emerging markets, frontier markets, and

standalone markets. Each is further divided into geographical regions. In

general, the emerging market sector has been grouped in several different

ways. The most commonly used grouping is the BRIC group. These four

countries were thought to be of similar levels of development. Subsequently,

South Africa was added to this group to form the BRICS. [4] Interestingly, as

- f year-end 2017, China was the second largest global stock market but
remains a developing market.

Table 24.3 provides basic data on the 20 largest global equity exchanges..

Global equity data on a frequent basis (daily or weekly) are found for many

countries, exchanges, and sectors in the _Wall Street Journal_, _Barron's_, _The_

_Economist_, and _Bloomberg_ .

```

```
Stock Market Indexes

```

Stock market indexes are provided in all global countries and exchanges. In

every country where stock trading takes place, at least one index measures

general share price movements on the domestic exchange. If a country has

more than one stock exchange, each exchange usually has its own index.

Non-exchange financial institutions also provide stock market data as

explained in chapter 22 News organizations and financial advisory services

create and distribute indexes.

```
Exchange-Provided Indexes

```

Here we review exchange-provided stock indexes for four countries: Japan,

the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Chinese stock indexes are

described later in this chapter.

Japan has two major stock indexes. The Tokyo Stock Exchange produces

the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or TOPIX. This composite index is based on

all shares in the Tokyo market's First Section, a designation reserved for

established and large companies whose shares are most actively traded and

widely held. The TOPIX is computed based on the included firm's market

cap. The second major Japanese index is sponsored by the financial

information firm, Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc., which also calculates and

publishes the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. This average, computed in the

same way as the Dow Jones 30, is based on the prices of 225 of the largest

companies in the First Section.

The U.K.'s London Stock Exchange (LSE) is covered by several widely

followed indexes, all created by the _Financial Times._ The _Financial Times_ is

a daily international newspaper based in London and owned by Nikkei Inc.

in Tokyo, Japan. The most popular is the Financial Times Stock Exchange

100 Index (FTSE 100 Index), often called the "Footsie," which is a market

value index that commonly includes the shares of the largest 100 U.K. firms,

whose market value makes up most of the market value of all U.K. equities.

The other indexes are the FTSE 350 Index (which combines the 350 largest

U.K. firms), the FTSE Small Cap Index, and the FTSE All-Share Index

(which is the aggregation of the largest U.K. stocks plus the stocks in the

FTSE Small Cap Index).

The primary German stock index is the DAX, which stands for Deutscher

Aktienindex, produced by the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The German name

for this exchange is the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse. Some financial

services regularly refer to the exchange by its initials, FWB. The DAX is

based on the 30 most actively traded shares listed on the Frankfurt exchange.

The FAZ index is another popular German index. Compiled by the

_Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,_ which is a daily newspaper, the FAZ index

is computed from the share prices of the 100 largest companies listed on the

Frankfurt exchange.

In France, a national association of stockbrokers and the Paris Bourse

produce an index based on the shares of 40 large and prominent firms traded

- n the exchange. The index is known as the CAC 40 Index after the name of
the bourse's electronic trading system. Given the increasing economic
integration of Europe, the CAC 40, the FTSE 100, and the DAX are all
regarded as reliable indicators of the overall performance of European stocks
and markets.

```
Non-Exchange Sponsors of International Indexes

```

To meet the increased interest in global equity investing, global nonexchange financial institutions have developed several respected

international stock indexes.

The MSCI provides families of U.S. and international stock indexes. The

international global equity indexes followed by most institutional investors

is the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index. The MSCI is

divided into the MSCI Global Standard Indexes, MSCI Global Small Cap

Indexes, and MSCI Value and Growth Indexes. The components in the

MSCI database have been used to create more than 28,000 indexes. The

MSCI World Index is a common benchmark for the global stock market.

They are market-cap weighted. Table 24.2 lists the equity indexes provided

by MSCI, divided into developed markets, emerging markets, frontier

markets, and standalone markets. These indexes are widely used by

institutional investors. There are also growth and value versions of these

indexes.

The _Financial Times_ has also created a series of global stock market

indices: FTSE All-World Index Series, FTSE Emerging Markets, FTSE

Global Equity Index Series, FTSE Global Sector Index Series, FTSE Global

Small Cap Index Series, FTSE Global Style Index Series, FTSE Gold Mines

Index Series, FTSE Multinationals Index Series, FTSE Shariah Global

Equity Index Series, and FTSE Watch List Index Series. This series of

indexes is also widely used.

```
Regulation of the U.K. and European Stock Markets

```

It is not possible here to provide a detailed discussion of the regulation of the

equity markets in the United Kingdom and Europe. Here we simply provide

a brief discussion of the major events and legislation.

```
Market in Financial Instruments Directive

```

The Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), promulgated in

November 2007, provided significant changes in the European Union (EU)

securities market regulatory infrastructure. Note that during 2007–2009, the

period during which the global Great Recession occurred, significant reform

also took place in the U.S. equities markets.

There are currently both similarities and differences between the U.S.

(described in chapter 22) and EU financial regulations. [5] Both regulatory

systems attempt to maintain fair and orderly markets, protect investors, and

provide price transparency, although MiFID rules do not apply to dark pools.

There are two major differences. First, investor protection rules for the

European Union are two-tiered between retail and professional investors; in

the United States, the same regulatory scheme protects all investors (with

some carve-outs for institutional investors). Second, in the United States,

quotes and transaction data reported by the national exchanges are

consolidated into a single system and disseminated to market participants. In

contrast, in the European Union, quotes and trades are fragmented among

multiple trading venues, and no consolidation is required.

On January 3, 2018, the European Union revised its MiFID rules to

include MiFID II, which ensures that asset managers obtain value for trade

research by unbundling what asset managers pay for investment research.

According to these rules, asset managers will either have to pay for the

research themselves or charge their customers for the research. U.S.

investors who do business in the European Union or the United Kingdom

will also be affected. The effects of these changes are projected to be

significant.

Competition in the securities markets has increased in the European

Union, but trading has become more fragmented, and liquidity has moved

from the exchanges, raising the concern of "fragmented liquidity" that led to

the adoption of Reg. NMS in the United States, as discussed in chapter 22.

In both regions, consolidation among exchanges has increased, and it seems

that an increasing share of equity trading has moved to dark pools.

```
The Big Bang

```

A strong impetus for regulatory change in Europe was the "Big Bang,"

which occurred in London in 1986. The Big Bang caused significant

permanent changes in the U.K. market structure and mechanics. The changes

included terminating fixed commissions and ending the distinction between

stockbrokers and stockjobbers. Stockbrokers acted as agents for their clients

- n a commission basis. Stockjobbers ("jobbers") made markets; that is, they
engaged in the purchase and sale of stocks for their own "books" and were,
thus, principals in the markets. Jobbers thus provided liquidity to the
markets. Prior to this change, brokers and jobbers had to be independent and
not be part of a broader financial group. These restrictions were removed by
the Big Bang.

These regulatory changes immediately changed the LSE from floorbased, open-outcry markets to screen-based, electronic trading markets. The

LSE's rules went into effect on October 27, 1986. A surge in trading activity

followed, but quickly thereafter, there was a complete change in market

structure regarding electronic trading, and the LSE floor became empty as all

the trading moved "upstairs," which means into offices off of the exchange

floor. These changes pre-dated similar changes that occurred in many other

global exchanges and eventually in the NYSE.

```
Chinese Equity Markets

```

The Chinese equity markets are relatively young, and China is not currently

considered a developed country, but rather a developing country. The

Chinese stock market is very different from most other developed country

global stock markets. It is driven by retail rather than institutional investors.

According to CNBC, roughly 85% of trades are by retail investors. [6]

Chinese retail investors also tend to be very sensitive to risk—they sell

- n bad news and buy on good news more quickly than do institutional and
retail investors in the United States. Retail investors are often considered to

be "noise investors;" that is, they make buy and sell decisions without using

fundamental data and often overreact to both good and bad news. Overall,

China's retail investors are very active traders/speculators, not long-term

investors. In addition, in China, most of the large-cap companies are owned

by large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the retail investors gravitate to

the smaller companies, making these smaller markets even more volatile.

These factors account for the Chinese stock market being much more

volatile than the U.S. market. For these reasons, market observers refer to

the Chinese stock market as a "casino," with the price of companies bearing

little connection to their underlying economic fundamentals. [7]

In general, it is commonly regarded that the following are major

disadvantages of the Chinese equity markets. The first disadvantage is the

short-term, speculative orientation of the investors. This results in substantial

volatility of the Chinese equity markets, especially the unlisted markets (as

discussed below) and its investors. The second is the absence of financial

advisors to counsel retail investors. Retail transactions are conducted by

banks, which do not provide financial advice. The third drawback is the lack

- f longer term institutional investors; that is, there are very few mutual funds
(including index funds). Fourth is the opaque nature of the unlisted markets

- which adds to volatility. The fifth disadvantage is the poor quality of the
accountability-oriented policies for shareholder protection coupled with
weak business practices, such as limited financial disclosure and insider
transactions. Finally, Chinese government market intervention policies are
not well developed and not well understood by investors. With respect to
government intervention policies, for example, during the significant
Chinese stock market decline of 2015, the major Chinese stock index, the
CSI 300 (discussed below), declined from over 5,000 to below 3,000. In
response, the Chinese government became more interventionist to
contravene declining prices. Among the actions of the Chinese government
took were actively encouraging investors to buy stock on margin and
prohibiting institutions holding more than 5% stakes in Chinese companies
from selling their positions.

On the other hand, among the advantages of the Chinese equity markets

are (1) its large size, (2) its rapid growth, and (3) the low correlation of the

Chinese equity markets with other international markets. Investors find these

advantages compelling.

As the Chinese equity markets mature, the abovementioned

disadvantages may moderate. Because the Chinese equity markets are very

large, are growing rapidly, and have already have become major parts of

many global portfolios, we conclude this chapter with a discussion of these

markets.

```
Chinese Stock Market Structure

```

The structure and workings of the Chinese equity markets are quite different

from those of other international exchanges. This structure is shown in figure

24.1. As shown in the figure, about 30% of Chinese stocks are listed on one

- f the three stock exchanges (Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen
exchanges), and 70% are not listed on an exchange. Stocks not listed on any

- f these exchanges are referred to as "unlisted," that is, not traded on any
exchanges and traded only on private markets. The private markets are very
active. Of the 30% of listed stocks, about half are government-owned
companies, referred to as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the other half
are private companies. This mix between SOEs and private companies has
changed over time. SOEs are discussed further below.

```
Figure 24.1

```

The Chinese stock market and exchanges: (a): structure of the Chinese stock market; (b) Chinese stock

exchanges; (c) Chinese stock indexes.

A unique aspect of the Chinese stock market is the SOEs. SOEs are legal

entities that are fully or partially owned by the state and conduct commercial

activities on behalf of the state. At the birth of the People's Republic of

China in 1949, all businesses were SOEs. The Chinese government has sold

many of its SOEs since the turn of the century. As of 2011, 35% of business

activity and 43% of the profits in the People's Republic of China was due to

companies in which the government had a majority ownership. [8] These SOEs

are typically extremely large and most are located in Beijing.

SOEs have played an important role in the development of the Chinese

economy. In the 1980s, SOEs (the state sector) accounted for 80% of the

Chinese economy. However, due to the rapid increase in the private

economy, by 2017, SOEs accounted for only 20% of the economy.

The Chinese stock market indexes capture only the listed markets, which

are heavily state owned. The unlisted market is very large but is not

represented in any of the indexes. This structure causes a concern about

transparency.

Table 24.4 shows the Chinese stock exchanges. The Chinese stock

exchanges collectively represent the second largest stock market in the

world. China's market comprises the fifth, sixth, and eight largest stock

exchanges in the world. Stocks traded on these exchanges are referred to as

"listed" and "mainstream" stock exchanges.

The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) also owns a technology exchange,

ChiNext, founded on October 23, 2009. The Shanghai Stock Exchange

(SSE) is in general considered to be similar to the NYSE, which lists many

large stocks, whereas the SZSE specializes in small cap and technology

stocks and is considered to be similar to the Nasdaq.

The two mainland exchanges, Shanghai and Shenzhen, opened in 1990 as

part of Deng Xiaoping's privatization program. The Hong Kong Stock

Exchange (SEHK) was formally set up in 1891, and a number of important

developments occurred beginning in 1986. The two mainland Chinese stock

exchanges, SSE and the SZSE, were founded in 1990.

The last column in table 24.4 shows the designations for the Chinese

stock market indexes, which are discussed below. As explained above, only

stock exchange-traded stocks are included in these indexes. This raises a

concern about transparency.

**`Chinese currency`** China's official currency is called the renminbi
(denoted by RMB). Renminbi translates to "the people's currency" in
Mandarin. It was first issued in December 1948 with the establishment of the

People's Republic of China. Although its official abbreviation is ¥, the

common abbreviation is RMB.

The yuan is the base unit of account of the currency, which means that

the currency is denominated in 1 yuan, 2 yuan, and so on. The yuan is

denoted by ¥. An analogy with the U.S. would be between the unit of value

- f the Federal Reserve Note (a unit of value akin to the yuan) and the U.S.
dollar (a currency akin to the renminbi). Prices are referred to in dollars, not
Federal Reserve Notes.

In practice, however, they are fungible. The yuan is commonly used for

international applications. The _Wall Street Journal_ and the _New York Times_

report the Chinese currency versus the U.S. dollar in yuan rather than RMB.

```
Chinese Stock Market Regulations

```

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is an institution of the

People's Republic of China. It is the main regulator of the securities industry

in China. China's Securities Law, which became effective July 1, 1999, was

the nation's first securities legislation. The responsibilities of the CSRC are

mandated in the Securities Law, the Law of the People's Republic of China

- n Securities Investment Funds, and a series of related laws that have
expanded the duties and powers of the CSRC. Several regulatory reforms
have been enacted to support the movement toward a more market-based
financial sector.

The CSRC's authorization to implement a centralized and unified

regulation of China's securities market to ensure its lawful operation is

granted by Chinese law. The CSRC oversees China's nationwide centralized

securities supervisory system, with the power to regulate and supervise

securities issuers, as well as to investigate and impose penalties for "illegal

activities related to securities and futures." Its functions are similar to those

- f the SEC in the United States.

The CSRC's responsibilities include: (1) formulating policies, laws, and

regulations concerning markets in securities and futures contracts; (2)

- verseeing issuing, trading, custody, and settlement of equity shares, bonds,
and investment funds; and (3) supervising listing, trading, and settlement of
futures contracts; futures exchanges; and securities and futures firms.

The CSRC performs a unified regulatory function over the securities and

futures market of China, maintains an orderly securities and futures market,

and ensures a legal operation of the capital market. CSRC is located in

Beijing, China.

**`Split-share-structure reform`** Prior to April 2005, companies traded on
China's stock markets followed a split share structure, whereby one-third of
the shares were public stocks, which were freely traded, and two-thirds were
SOEs, which were nontradable shares (NTS). The NTS contributed to both
significant corporate governance problems and to a lack of incentives and
manager responsibilities for the state-ownership structure of many
enterprises, which it was believed contributed to the inefficiency and low
productivity of the SOEs. [9] These two types of shares had the same dividends
and voting rights; they were distinguishable only by whether they could be
traded and thus, by their liquidity.

The original reason for the existence of the NTS structure was that the

main goal of the Chinese government in forming the stock market was to

raise capital for its SOEs and yet retain control of these enterprises.

Achieving these goals jointly required secondary market trading. The

tradable shares were called "floating" shares; and the nontradable shares

were called "nonfloating," state-owned, or "legal" shares. One-third of the

shares were freely traded public stocks, and two-thirds were SOEs, which

were not publicly traded.

This so-called split-share structure did not achieve its goals. The NTS did

not trade efficiently. So, in April 2005, the CSRC adopted a reform called

the "Split Share Structure Reform" (SSSR), whereby all NTS became

tradable on the listed stock markets, that is, they became floating shares.

Due to these differences in liquidity, tradable shares had a greater value

than the otherwise identical NTS. Thus, before the NTS began trading

according to the SSSR, the holders of the tradable shares had to be

compensated by the holders of the previous NTS for their differences in

value. For this reason, nontradable shareholders negotiated a settlement with

tradable shareholders which would apply when the NTS became tradable.

Specifically, according to the reform proposal, the shareholders of the NTS

compensated the tradable shareholders with approximately three additional

shares per ten original shares when all their NTS shares became tradable.

In retrospect, the SSSR has provided a significant positive effect on the

Chinese stock market. The quality and dependability of stock market pricing

has improved significantly since the implementation of the SSSR.

Specifically, an empirical study by the European Central Bank confirmed

that the SSST benefited small stocks, stocks issues with poorer governance,

and stocks with less liquidity. Neglected stocks also saw an increase in

trading volume and prices. [10]

Overall, the SSSR implemented a reform which eliminated the NTS

shares typically held by the state or by politically connected institutional

investors. China's A-share market efficiency—liquidity and pricing—

improved significantly after the SSSR was adopted. These SSSR reforms

applied only to A-shares, not Band H-shares, as discussed below.

**`Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor Program`** The Qualified
Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) is a program that permits certain
licensed international investors to participate in China's mainland stock
exchanges. The QFII program was launched by the People's Republic of
China in 2002 to allow foreign investors access to its stock exchanges in
Shanghai and Shenzhen. Prior to QFII, foreign investors were not able to
buy or sell shares on China's stock exchanges because of China's tight
capital controls. With the launch of the QFII program, licensed investors can
buy and sell RMB-denominated "A" shares. Foreign access to these shares is
limited by specified quotas that determine the amount of money that the
licensed foreign investors are permitted to invest in China's capital markets.
Thus, foreign investors benefit from an opportunity to invest in onshore
China, which is otherwise often insulated from the rest of the world, and are
subject to capital controls governing and movement of assets in and out of
the country.

As of April 2012, the combined quota for the QFII program was set at

\$80 billion. The quotas are granted by China's State Administration of

Foreign Exchange, and the quotas can be adjusted to reflect and respond to

the country's economic and financial situation. The types of investments

include listed A-share stocks (excluding foreign-oriented B-shares). To be

approved as a licensed investor, certain qualifications must be met

(qualifications depend on the type of investor, such as fund management

companies and insurance companies). For example, fund management

companies are required to have a minimum of five years of experience in

assets management and must have managed at least \$5 billion in securities

assets.

The QFII program was instrumental in including A-shares in U.S. stock

indexes by MSCI, as discussed below. MSCI is moving slowly to include Ashares in its indexes, because an investor has to be part of the QFII program

to invest in A-shares, which sets limits on the amount investors can invest.

As indicated, QFII permits foreign investors to invest in China. The

- bverse of this is the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII)
program, which permits certain Chinese institutional investors (such as
banks, funds, and investment companies) to invest in securities outside
China. The QDII program in China was set up to provide the growing
number of Chinese investors with a larger market where they could invest
their funds. The Chinese stock markets were not always deep enough to
provide sufficient investment markets. As an example, an institutional
investor could be approved, according to QDII, to invest up to 50% of its net
assets into allowable foreign securities, as long as not more than 5% was
invested in any single security.

```
Chinese Stock Exchanges

```

There are three major exchanges in the Chinese stock market: the Hong

Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK), the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and

the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). The last two exchanges are often

referred to as the "mainland" or "on-shore" stock exchanges. Figure 24.1

provides the designations for the Chinese stock exchanges and their

corresponding indexes.

The SEHK is the sixth largest global stock exchange and Asia's third

largest stock exchange, after the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock

Exchange. The exchange has been very aggressive in introducing electronic

trading. After introducing a computer-assisted trading system in 1986, it

introduced its complete system in October 2000. A small physical trading

floor still exists, but it accounts for less than 1% of total trading volume.

SEHK is entirely open to foreign investors.

The SSE is the fifth largest global stock exchange and the largest stock

exchange in mainland China. It is a nonprofit organization operated by the

CSRC. Stocks, funds, and bonds are all traded on the exchange, which has

listing requirements including that a company must be in business and be

earning a profit for at least three years before joining the exchange. SSE was

established in 1990. SSE has a total of approximately 870 listed companies,

1,351 listed stocks (A-shares and B-shares) with \$2.78 trillion in market

capitalization and a \$5.22 trillion stock turnover. The trading system is

capable of processing and executing 180 million orders for A-share trading

and four million orders for B-share trading on a daily basis.

The SZSE is the eighth largest global exchange, the third largest

exchange in China, and the fourth largest exchange in Asia. The SZSE lists

more than 1,500 companies, most of which are controlled by the Chinese

government. The SZSE opened the ChiNext board, a Nasdaq-type exchange

for technology start-ups, during October 2009. Founded in 1990, the SZSE

- perates a Main Board, a Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Board, a
Growth Enterprise Board, and a stock transfer agent system. Recently, there
have been 467 companies on the Main Board, 327 companies on the Small
and Medium-Sized Enterprises Board, and 36 companies on the Growth
Enterprise Board, with market capitalizations of approximately \$0.6 trillion,
\$0.25 trillion, and \$24.1 million, respectively.

```
Chinese Stock Market Share Classes (A, B, and H)

```

Stock trading in China is often thought to be complicated, mainly due to its

multiple classes and the rules for permitted types of investors for each class.

Overall, as indicated above, Chinese stock trading occurs on three

exchanges, the SEHK, SSE, and the SZSE. In addition, many Chinese stocks

are unlisted: They do not trade on the exchanges but are traded on private

markets (see figure 24.1). Listed companies (on these exchanges) in China

fall into three primary share class categories: A-shares, B-shares, and Hshares.

For every stock listed on either the SSE or the SZSE, two share classes

are listed: A-shares and B-shares. In general, A-shares are traded by

mainland Chinese investors and B-shares by international investors.

A-shares are traded in yuan (RMB) and are available to all mainland

Chinese investors; they are also available to foreign investors but only

through a QFII program. A-shares were only available to mainland

Chinese investors, but this restriction ended in 2013. Since then, QFIIlicensed foreign institutions that have received a special permission by

the Chinese government, can also participate in this A-share market, as

discussed above.

B-shares are traded mainly among international investors. They are also

available to mainland Chinese investors who have a legal foreign

currency account. B-shares are quoted in U.S. dollars on the SSE and in

Hong Kong dollars on the SZSE. B-shares are based on local Chinese

companies. They have a face value in RMB. They are listed for trading

primarily by international investors. However, B-shares are also open to

domestic investors, provided that these investors set up a foreign

currency account. B-shares are traded in U.S. dollars on the SSE and in

Hong Kong dollars on the SZSE. Many companies list and trade their

shares simultaneously on the SEHK and the mainland Chinese stock

exchanges and thus offer two share classes, called "dual listing," as

discussed below.

H-shares are shares of companies incorporated in mainland China,

which are listed on the SEHK. Although they are regulated by the

Chinese legal system, H-shares are denominated in Hong Kong dollars

and are traded in the same way as the other stocks on the SEHK. Many

companies list their shares on both the SEHK and one of the two

mainland Chinese stock exchanges (dual listing), as discussed below.

The top part of table 24.5 summarizes the characteristics of A-, B-, and

H-share classes. The bottom part of the table summarizes the availability of

the three share classes to Chinese and U.S. investors.

A-Shares versus H-Shares

```

Prior to 2013, A-shares were available only to mainland Chinese investors

and were traded by Chinese investors (on the Shanghai and Shenzhen

exchanges). However, since 2013, QFII investors can also trade A-shares. Hshares can be traded freely by anyone (including mainland Chinese

investors) with legal foreign currency accounts. Prior to 2007, Chinese

investors could trade only A-shares (on the two mainland exchanges), not Hshares, even for stocks for which both A-shares and H-shares were listed.

Since 2007, China has allowed Chinese investors to invest in either Ashares or H-shares of companies that have H-shares listed on the SEHK.

Different types of investors can own the A-shares (which trade on the two

mainland exchanges) and the H-shares (which trade on the SEHK) of the

identical, mainland stocks. As a result, very large price differences may

- ccur between the two markets for two otherwise identical stocks. Spreads
- f 30%, 80%, and even 100% between the two shares are observed. That is,
A-shares may trade at large premiums to H-shares for these dual-listed
stocks.

Despite these large spreads, there is no channel for arbitrage between the

two markets. Among the reasons for the existences of these spreads are (1)

large institutional foreign investors invest in H-shares, and the institutions

are better at assessing value and are not as speculative; (2) there is a large

imbalance between the supply of and demand for high quality stocks in

China due to market segmentation; and (3) restrictions/regulations combined

with high demand increase the premiums for A-shares.

The number of dual listings (that is, the same stock being listed on a

mainland exchange and on SEHK) is small. There were less than 100 dually

listed stocks in early 2017.

**`Red chips`** A red chip company is a company based in mainland China that
is incorporated internationally and listed on the SEHK. Red chip stocks are
expected to maintain the filing and reporting requirements of the SEHK,
which makes them a main outlet for foreign investors who wish to
participate in the rapid growth of the Chinese economy. Red chips may be
issued in addition to A-shares of the same companies, although only Chinese
citizens can invest in the A-shares (unless the investor is part of a QFII
program).

**`Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect`** Stock Connect is an investment
channel that connects SSE and SEHK, so that investors in each market can
trade shares on the other's market using their local brokers and clearing
houses. This "connection" was the first link between the mainland and Hong

Kong for a broad range of investors. This program began in November 2014.

A similar link, the Shenzhen–Hong Kong Stock Connect, began in

December 2016 and connects SZSE and SEHK. These links are used mostly

by institutions. For individuals to use these links they must demonstrate that

they are sophisticated investors by having a minimum level of assets and

passing a test. It may be necessary, however, for individuals to go to Hong

Kong and open an account with a local broker. Only A-shares are included in

these stock connects, not B-shares.

```
Chinese Stock Market Indexes

```

The Chinese stock market indexes are based entirely on listed stocks, that is,

stocks listed on one of the exchanges. The listed stocks are approximately

50% based on SOEs and 50% based on private stocks. Unlisted stocks are

traded in very active markets and are not traded on any exchange. The major

stock indexes in China are the Hang Seng Index, the Shanghai Composite

Index, the Shenzhen Component Index, and the CSI 300 Index.

The Hang Seng Index (His) is a free-float-adjusted market capitalizationweighted stock market index traded on the SEHK. The 50 constituent

companies of the His represent about 58% of the capitalization of the

SEHK. The index is used to record and monitor daily changes of the largest

companies. The His was started in November 1969 and is currently

compiled and maintained by Hang Seng Indexes Company Limited, which is

a wholly owned subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank. The 50 His stocks are also

divided into four subindexes: finance, utilities, properties, and commerce

and industry

The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE Comp) is a

capitalization-weighted index that tracks the price performance of all the Ashares and B-shares listed on the SSE. The index was developed on

December 19, 1990 with a base value of 100.

The Shenzhen Composite Index (SZSE Composite Index), the major

index of SZSE, is an index of 500 stocks traded on this exchange. It is a

capitalization weighted index that was developed on April 3, 1991.

The CSI 300 is free-float market cap-weighted index of 300 A-share

stocks that are listed on the two mainland stock exchanges. The index was

established in April 2005. It is compiled by the China Securities Index

Company Ltd. It is divided into 10 subindexes: energy, materials, industrials,

consumer discretionary, consumer stables, health care, financial, information

technology, telecommunications, and utilities.

A recently constructed Chinese stock index is the S&P China 500, which

is based on 500 of the largest, most liquid Chinese companies. Its

composition approximates the sector composition of the broader Chinese

equity market. The Chinese A-share classes and offshore listings are eligible

for inclusion. The index is calculated via weighting by the float-adjusted

market cap. This index is one of a family of S&P Dow Jones Indexes.

U.S. stock index sponsors are increasingly including stocks traded on

Chinese exchanges in their indexes. For example, in July 2017, MSCI began

including China A-shares in the relevant MSCI indexes (MSCI China Index,

MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and others), which includes A-share stocks

listed on the Shanghai-listed and Shenzhen-listed shares in this index. This

change added 222 Chinese A-shares from both the Shanghai and Shenzhen

exchanges. Prior to this, MSCI Emerging Markets Index and other related

indexes included only Chinese stocks which were not A-shares: for example,

Alibaba (which trades on the NYSE) and China Mobile (which trades on the

Hong Kong exchange). The inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI Indexes

supports a greater institutional investor base for these Chinese stocks. To be

included in U.S. indexes, non-Chinese investors have to be eligible to buy

A-shares by being eligible through the QFII, as discussed above.

```
Chinese vs U.S. Equity Markets

```

Let's compare the Chinese equity market to the U.S. equity market. Both

have quite a long history. The year each Chinese stock exchange was

established is shown in table 24.4. The Shanghai Stock Exchange dates back

to the 1860s and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange began in 1891 and then

reopened in 1986. In the United States, the New York Stock Exchange was

founded in 1792.

A large share of stock trading in the United States is by institutions, while

most trading in the Chinese stock market is done by retail traders. As noted

earlier, Chinese exchanges are often likened to casinos. While U.S.

companies are heavily dependent on equity financing, Chinese companies

are much more dependent on bank loans and retained earnings.

The U.S. equity markets are much more open to foreign investors than

Chinese equity markets. As discussed earlier, on Chinese equity exchanges

A-shares are primarily traded among Chinese investors on the Shanghai and

Shenzen exchanges; B-shares are primarily traded by non-Chinese investors;

and H-shares are open to both Chinese and non-Chinese investors.

With respect to investor participation, the Chinese equity market structure

is much more complicated than the U.S. market structure.

```
Key Points

```

- The reasons for investing outside one's domestic market are that it allows
for better diversification (a better efficient frontier) and captures attractive
returns by investing in less price efficient markets.

   - An investor can invest in stock markets in other countries not only by
buying individual stocks traded in those countries but also by investing
in collective investment vehicles such closed-end funds, mutual funds,
and exchange-traded funds and via depositary receipts (ADRs and
GDRs).

   - The non-U.S. equity markets represent almost 50% of the global
equity markets.

   - The non-U.S. equity markets are composed of the European, Pacific,
and emerging markets.

   - The Big Bang in the United Kingdom made significant changes in
equity trading and caused an immediate movement from floor trading to
"upstairs" electronic trading.

   - The Chinese stock market is the second largest stock market globally
and is composed of two mainland stock exchanges (the Shanghai and
Shenzhen Stock Exchanges) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

   - China's stock exchanges are large. The Shanghai Stock Exchange is
the fifth largest globally, the Hong Kong is the sixth largest globally,
and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange is the eighth largest.

  - The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is China's
stock regulatory body, the analogue of the U.S. SEC.

- The Chinese stock market is composed mainly of retail, not
institutional, investors.

- Because retail investors in the Chinese stock market are very shortterm traders, who are very risk-sensitive, the Chinese markets are
highly volatile.

- The Chinese stock market is composed of 70% unlisted (that is, not
listed on any exchange) stocks and 30% listed, exchange-traded stocks;
the latter consist of approximately 50% private companies and 50%
government, state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

- There are several stock indexes, some associated with the exchanges
and others developed independent of the exchanges.

- The CSI 300 is considered to be the S&P 500 of China.
- The renminbi (denoted by RMB) is the official currency of China.
The Chinese yuan is the unit of account for the currency.

- The Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program permits
some international investors to invest in China's mainland stock

exchanges. Specifically, QFII-licensed international investors can

participate in Chinese A-shares.

- China's stock exchanges, among them, list three different share
classes: A, B, and H.

- A-shares and B-shares are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
Exchanges, whereas H-shares are listed on the Hong Kong Exchange.

- Different types of investors (Chinese and international) can trade
different types of the share classes, on different exchanges.

- A-shares are intended for use by Chinese investors; B-shares are
intended for use by international investors.

- On the Shanghai exchange, B-shares are denominated in U.S. dollars,
whereas on the Shenzhen exchange, they are denominated in Hong
Kong dollars.

- A red chip company is one that is based on mainland China,
incorporated internationally, and listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.

   - The major Chinese Stock Market Indexes are the Hang Seng Index
(His); Shanghai Composite Index (SH Comp); Shenzhen Component
Index (SZSE Component Index); and CSI 300 Index.

   - Although the Chinese equity markets have large market
capitalizations by international standards, they are relatively young.

   - The Chinese equity markets are primarily retail markets in contrast to
the U.S. equity market which is institutional.

   - Equity financing is less important in China than it is in the United

States.

As we have seen, financial markets can be classified in various ways. For

example, there is the classification into equity markets versus debt markets

according to the nature of the claim of the holder of the financial

instrument. The cash market and the derivative markets differ, as explained

in earlier chapters. As explained in chapter 1, for debt obligations, a

distinction is made based on the maturity of the financial instrument. The

two markets based on a maturity classification are the money market and

the capital market. Financial instruments that at the time of issuance have a

maturity of one year or less are referred to as **money market instruments**

and the market they trade in is called the **money market** . In contrast, the

capital market is the market where financial instruments with a maturity in

excess of one year trade. Because equity has a perpetual maturity, it is part

- f the capital market.

Our focus in this chapter is on the money market. This market plays the

following three vital roles in the financial system. First, it provides

investors who want to invest in liquid assets a market where they can do so.

Second, it provides those entities in need of liquidity a market where they

can borrow. Third, the money market provides central banks globally an

avenue through which they can implement monetary policy by influencing

the availability and cost of liquidity.

In this chapter, we describe the various private money market

instruments traded in the money market. By "private money market

instruments," we mean instruments issued by nongovernmental entities:

nonfinancial and financial corporations. Private money market instruments

include unsecured loans made between banks, repurchase agreements,

commercial paper, large-denomination negotiable certificates of deposit,

banker's acceptances, and money market funds.

What is important in reviewing private money market instruments is not

just the first role cited above—that is, the appeal of the various instruments

from the perspective of an investor—but also the last two roles. As we have

mentioned frequently in this book, liquidity is an important issue for

financial and nonfinancial corporations. When we described in chapter 2

government bailouts during the recent financial crisis as well as historically,

the problem encountered by the entity needing assistance was liquidity.

Indeed, liquidity was the chief culprit in the financial crisis that began in

2007, which then caused a global recession in 2008–2009. Private money

market instruments must be purchased by investors willing to accept the

associated credit risk. Since the recent financial crisis, major shifts have

- occurred in the structure and regulation of the money market. These
changes are highlighted in this chapter.

```
Interbank Funding Market

```

Prior to the financial crisis that began with the subprime mortgage crisis in

2007, the most immediate liquidity source for banks was the **interbank**

**funding market** (also referred to as the **interbank lending market** ). As

the name indicates, this is the market where banks lend funds to one

another, although there is some participation in this market by

nondepository institutions. Two types of lending take place between banks

in this market: unsecured and secured lending. In the unsecured sector of

the market, lending is done through the federal funds market. In the secured

sector, lending is done through repurchase agreements that we describe later

.

in this chapter; this sector is referred to as the **repo market**

In the financial market, the interbank funding market was the most

liquid sector during normal market conditions. Certain events have stressed

this market. For example, the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,

resulted in disruptions in communications and reporting systems such that

demand by banks for liquidity increased substantially. However, within a

few days, the market had returned to its normal functioning. In contrast, the

2008–2009 global recession caused such disruptions in the interbank

funding market that questions arose about the future viability of parts of this

market. In fact, one of the key problems that characterized the financial

crisis from 2007 on was the problems faced in the interbank funding

market. Understanding the reasons for these problems is important for

understanding the growing importance of other sectors of the money market

(i.e., the private money market instruments) that we describe in this chapter.

This is because the entire structure of the money market has changed as a

result of the changes in the interbank funding market since the financial

crisis.

The **eurocurrency market** is the market for deposits operating under a

different regulatory apparatus than for deposits used for making domestic

transactions. One prominent example is bank deposits denominated in

British pounds sterling in banks outside the United Kingdom. The "euro" in

"eurocurrency" is a misnomer. These markets have origins in Europe.

Today the term refers to any currency held in deposits offshore. Another

example is an **international banking facility** . These facilities allow

depository institutions in the United States to provide banking services to

nonresidents and are not be subject to the U.S. regulations that restrict the

behavior of banks. International banking facilities are free from some

Federal Reserve requirements (see chapter 6).

There is a parallel structure in the provision of banking services—

- nshore and offshore. **Onshore** refers to the traditional domestic market.

**Offshore** refers to eurocurrency. As noted, eurocurrency is any currency on
deposit in banks outside their country of origin. These deposits are traded in
the eurocurrency market. The source of these deposits is large financial
institutions and corporations. Interbank interest rates are rates that large
financial institutions charge one another for loans.

```
Interbank Lending Rates

```

**`Federal funds rate and central bank interest rates`** In the United

States, transactions of depository institutions with either another depository

institution or an eligible nondepository entity that involve one party making

an unsecured loan to the other party takes place in the **federal funds**

**market** (or **fed funds market** ). The average interest rate at which these fed

funds transactions take place in the market is referred to as the **federal**

**funds rate** - r **fed funds rate** . Using daily data on federal funds transactions

voluntarily supplied by major brokers in the fed funds market to the Federal

Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed), a measure of the overnight fed

funds rate is computed each day. This rate is called the **daily federal funds**

**effective rate** .

As explained in chapter 6, banks must maintain reserves at their local

Federal Reserve Bank. At one time, no interest was paid by the Federal

Reserve Banks on the reserves deposited with them. These deposited

reserves have two components. The first is required reserves and the second

is excess reserves (i.e., the amount of reserves that exceeds required

reserves). In 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks began paying interest on

reserves because of the ongoing financial crisis. [1] The Federal Reserve

Banks pay a different interest on required reserves and excess reserves. The

rate paid on required reserves is called the **interest on reserves**, and the rate

paid on excess reserves is called the **interest on excess reserves** (IOER).

The Fed's objective in paying interest on reserves was to eliminate the

- pportunity cost faced by banks when funds were tied up in the form of
reserves. The purpose of paying IOER was linked to the Fed's ability to
control the daily federal funds effective rate. In the fed funds market, excess
reserves are traded (i.e., lent) to those banks that do not have sufficient
deposits to satisfy required reserves. Before the payment of IOER by the
Federal Reserve Bank, banks with excess reserves could lend those reserves
at a market rate. With the Fed paying IOER, it became less appealing for a
bank with excess reserves to lend those funds at a rate below the IOER.

The mechanism used by the Fed to influence the overnight fed funds rate

so that the rate set in the market was close to the target level for the

- vernight fed funds rate that was established by the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) is as follows. Through open market operations, the Fed
changes the supply of reserves in the market and, in combination with

IOER, the overnight fed funds rate is affected such that it is within the

range of the target level established by the FOMC.

The federal funds reserve rate is the rate the Federal Reserve establishes.

Central banks in other countries establish a similar interest rate. Table 25.1

lists the names of various central banks and their interest rates.

**`Unsecured interbank offered rate benchmarks`** The U.S. fed funds

rate is not a market-determined rate that reflects unsecured borrowing by

banks in the interbank funding market. Instead, the fed funds rate is an

artificial rate whose target level is determined by the Federal Reserve. In

contrast, there is an interbank funding rate at which banks can borrow on an

unsecured basis outside the United States in the London money market.

That rate is the **London interbank offered rate** (LIBOR).

LIBOR is not derived directly from actual unsecured loan transactions in

the interbank funding market. Instead, LIBOR is calculated based on

responses to a daily market survey by an administrator of this interest rate.

Prior to 2014, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) was the

administrator of this rate. In early 2014, the responsibility of administrating

LIBOR was shifted to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and LIBOR is

now referred to as "ICE LIBOR."

To calculating LIBOR, a panel of large banks [2] estimates the interest rate

at which it could borrow on the interbank market for seven different

maturities: overnight (one day), one week, one month, two months, three

months, six months, and 12 months. Moreover, LIBOR is calculated for

five different currencies: the U.S. dollar (USD LIBOR), the British pound

sterling (GBP LIBOR), euros (EUR LIBOR or Euribor), the Japanese yen

(JPY LIBOR), and the Swiss franc (CHF LIBOR). [3] ICE's official LIBOR

values for each maturity and each currency, abbreviated as shown here, are

announced by Thomson Reuters once a day.

The **Euro Overnight Index Average** is the average overnight Euribor. It

is compiled as an average of rates charged by 35 contributing banks on

- vernight unsecured loans denominated in euros. The contributing banks
include EU banks and large international banks from non-EU countries that
are part of the Eurozone.

Understanding how the official LIBOR for each maturity and currency is

calculated is important. Every panel bank reports to Thomson Reuters at 11

a.m. London time every working day the interest rate at which it would

expect to be able to raise a substantial loan in the interbank money market

at that time. Because not every panel bank borrows a substantial amount for

each maturity (or any maturity, for that matter) every day, the calculation is

not based on actual loan transactions. From the rates reported by the panel

banks, Thomson Reuters eliminates the lowest and highest 25% and then

averages the remaining reported rates to obtain the official LIBOR for a

given maturity and currency.

LIBOR is a key interest rate, because it is used as a reference interest

rate for an estimated \$360 trillion of derivative contracts. Moreover, it is

used to set rates on commercial business loans, consumer loans, and

mortgage loans for residential and commercial property. Consequently,

LIBOR is viewed as the most important benchmark interest rate in the

global financial market. As such, its calculation is extremely important for

all participants in the financial market.

The current issue regarding LIBOR is whether this survey-based

borrowing cost truly reflects interbank funding costs, particularly during

periods of market distress, such as the 2008–2009 financial crisis. During

this period, little trading took place in the interbank funding market in

London. Consequently, many market participants questioned the official

suite of rates reported by the BBA when it was the administrator for

LIBOR.

In 2012, several stories in the press reported that some panel banks had

submitted false information used to calculate LIBOR. It was alleged that

certain panel banks had intentionally underestimated the rate at which they

estimated they could borrow funds overnight from other banks. The reason

for underestimating the borrowing rate is that had this not been done, it

would have increased the cost for overnight loans, signaling that the

financial condition of the bank submitting the information was

deteriorating. Subsequent investigations of the survey process for

computing LIBOR by regulators in several countries confirmed the

manipulation of LIBOR by some panel banks. This LIBOR-rigging scandal

led to the filing of lawsuits against the panel banks alleged to have been

involved. Several banks have settled these suits. [4] In the United Kingdom,

the BBA agreed to transfer oversight of LIBOR to regulators in that country

based on the recommendation of an independent review committee headed

by Martin Wheatley, managing director of the U.K. Financial Services

Authority.

The interest rate on unsecured lending plays an important role in global

financial markets. For this reason, the Financial Stability Board (FSB)

prepared a report in 2014 titled _Reforming Major Interest Rate_

_Benchmarks_ . [5] The report made two recommendations. The first

recommendation involved enhancing prevailing interest rate benchmarks

for key interbank offered rates in the unsecured lending markets. These key

interbank offered rates are referred to as the "IBORs." The second

recommendation was for promoting the development and adoption of

interest rates that reflected nearly risk-free benchmark rates. In July 2015,

the FSB published a report titled _Progress in Reforming Major Interest Rate_

_Benchmarks_ as an interim report describing the implementation of the

recommendations that were made in the 2014 report. [6] After the July 2015

interim report, the group responsible for IBOR took further steps toward

implementing the recommendations in the 2014 FSB report, which was to

improve the interest rate benchmarks for unsecured lending. It did so by

adopting a methodology to obtain whenever possible rates based on

transaction data to avoid the problems discussed earlier with LIBOR.

**`Future of the interbank funding market`** During the financial crisis
that began with the subprime mortgage crisis in mid-2007, severe
disruptions took place in the interbank funding market. Some observers
have argued that the market froze, and furthermore, some believe the
market will not recover.

The 2008–2009 financial crisis caused an increase in the demand for

highly liquid assets. U.S. bank managers preferred to pursue a strategy of

maintaining liquid assets that might be needed if the crisis worsened rather

than make loans that would be illiquid assets on their balance sheets. [7] In

addition, bank management preference shifted to very short-term, highcredit-quality secured loans. The preference for the type of collateral for

secured loans changed from the pre-crisis period. In lending transactions

with other banks and financial institutions, bank management preferred

liquid assets. That is, in a lending arrangement such as a repurchase

agreement (to be discussed later in the chapter), collateral could be, for

example, a short-term financial instrument of high credit quality or a pool

- f residential mortgage loans to borrowers with impaired credit history.
Banks preferred the former types of loans to the latter.

Consequently, the economic and financial conditions resulted in an

environment in which banks were conservative in the amount they lent in

- rder to maintain highly liquid assets on their balance sheets, and when
secured loans were made, collateral that was of high credit quality with high
liquidity was preferred. Moreover, loans with a short maturity were
preferred. Because of the reduction in the supply of interbank loans,
borrowing costs increased significantly. This resulted in a vicious cycle,
leading to further conservative policies by bank management that increased
the demand for liquidity, a reduction in the amount of loans, and a further
increase in borrowing costs. For example, prior to the month when Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, loans between U.S.
commercial banks reached a peak of \$494 billion in September 2008. After
the bankruptcy filing, loans between U.S. banks fell to \$153 billion. [8] It was
not until the federal government took the actions we described in chapter 2
that the cycle was broken, but concerns remained that the interbank funding
market might not be relied on to provide liquidity in the future.

Several studies have provided empirical support for the freezing of the

interbank funding market globally. For example, Gary Gorton and Andrew

Metrick found that in the repo market, bank policies that involved

increasing the amount of collateral required effectively caused a run in the

repo market, particularly for loans involving low-credit-quality assets. [9] A

different conclusion about the survival of the interbank lending market is

provided in a study by Gara Afonso, Anna Kovner, and Antoinette Schoar,

who investigated the response of the fed funds market to the bankruptcy of

Lehman Brothers. [10] They found that the average amount of borrowing was

stable, even though the fed funds rate increased significantly and the terms

- f the lending agreements became more sensitive to the risk characteristics
- f the borrowing bank. They argue that the market did not freeze, but also
that it did not expand to meet the increased demand by banks needing
liquidity.

```
Repo Market

```

A **repurchase agreement** (or simply repo) is the sale of a security with a

commitment by the seller to buy the security back from the purchaser at a

specified price at a designated future date. Basically, a repurchase

agreement is a collateralized loan where the collateral is a security or a pool

- f assets. The collateral in a repo can be money market instruments,
Treasury securities, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities,
asset-backed securities, or a pool of loans. As noted in our discussion of the
interbank funding market, repurchase agreements were used by banks to
make loans to other banks.

A repo agreement is best explained with an illustration. Suppose a

securities dealer purchases \$10 million of a particular bond issue. Where

does the dealer obtain the funds to finance that position? Of course, the

dealer can finance the position with its own funds or by borrowing from a

bank. Typically, however, the dealer uses the repo market to obtain

financing. In the repo market, the dealer can use the \$10 million of the bond

issue as collateral for a loan. The term of the loan and the interest rate that

the dealer agrees to pay (referred to as the **repo rate** ) are specified. When

the term of the loan is one day, it is called an **overnight repo** ; a loan for

.

more than one day is called a **term repo**

The transaction is referred to as a repurchase agreement because it calls

for the sale of the security and its repurchase at a future date. Both the sale

price and the repurchase price are specified in the agreement. The

difference between the purchase (repurchase) price and the sale price is the

dollar interest cost of the loan.

In our illustration, the dealer needs to finance \$10 million par value of

the bond that it purchased and plans to hold overnight. Suppose that a

customer of the dealer has excess funds of \$10 million. The dealer would

agree to deliver (i.e., sell) \$10 million of the bond to the customer for an

amount determined by the repo rate and buy (i.e., repurchase) the same

bond from the customer for \$10 million the next day. Suppose that the

- vernight repo rate is 3.5%.Then (as explained below), the dealer would
agree to deliver the bond for \$9,999,027.78 and repurchase the same bond
for \$10 million the next day. The \$972.22 difference between the sale price

- f \$9,999,027.78 and the repurchase price of \$10 million is the dollar
interest on the financing. From the customer's perspective, the agreement is
called a .
**reverse repo**

The following formula is used to calculate the dollar interest on a repo

transaction:

Dollar interest = Dollar principal × Repo rate × Repo term/360.

Notice that the interest is computed on a 360-day basis. In our example, at a

repo rate of 3.5% and a repo term of one day (overnight), the dollar interest

is \$972.22, derived as follows:

Dollar interest = $10,000,000 × 0.035 × 1/360 = $972.22.

The advantage to the dealer of using the repo market for borrowing on a

short-term basis is that the rate is less than the cost of bank financing. We

explain why later in this section. From the customer's perspective, the repo

market offers an attractive yield on a short-term secured transaction that is

highly liquid.

The example illustrates financing a dealer's long position in the repo

market, but dealers can also use the repo market to cover a short position.

For example, suppose a government dealer sold \$10 million of Treasury

securities two weeks ago and must now cover the position—that is, deliver

the securities. The dealer can do a reverse repo (agree to buy the securities

and sell them back). Of course, the dealer eventually would have to buy the

Treasury security in the market to cover its short position.

A good deal of Wall Street jargon is used to describe repo transactions.

To understand it, it is useful to remember that one party is lending money

and accepting a security as collateral for the loan; the other party is

borrowing money and providing the lender collateral for the loan. When

someone lends securities in order to receive cash (i.e., borrows money), that

party is said to be "reversing out" securities. A party that lends money with

the security as collateral is said to be "reversing in" securities. The

expressions "to repo securities" and "to do repo" are also used. The former

means that someone is going to finance securities using the security as

collateral; the latter means that the party is going to invest in a repo. Finally,

the expressions "selling collateral" and "buying collateral" are used to

describe a party financing a security with a repo, on one hand, and lending

- n the basis of collateral on the other.

```
Credit Risk

```

Despite the high-quality collateral typically underlying a repo transaction,

both parties to the transaction are exposed to credit risk (i.e., counterparty

risk). Even prior to the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the failure of a few small

government securities dealer firms who were parties to repo transactions in

the 1980s made market participants more cautious about the

creditworthiness of the counterparty to a repo. [11]

Why does credit risk occur in a repo transaction? Let's consider our

illustration in which the dealer uses \$10 million of government securities as

collateral for this borrowing. If the dealer cannot repurchase the

government securities, the customer may keep the collateral. If interest rates

- n government securities increase subsequent to the repo transaction, the
market value of the government securities declines, and the customer owns
securities with a market value less than the amount it lent to the dealer firm.

If the market value of the security rises instead, the dealer firm will be

concerned with the return of the collateral from the counterparty, which

then has a market value higher than the loan.

Repos are now more carefully structured to reduce credit risk exposure.

The amount lent is less than the market value of the securities used as

collateral, which provides the lender with some cushion should the market

value of the securities decline. The amount by which the market value of

the securities used as collateral exceeds the value of the loan is called the

"margin" or "haircut." The amount of margin varies with the type of

collateral, such as its liquidity and the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Another practice used to limit credit risk is to mark the collateral to

market on a regular basis. Recall that the practice of marking to market

means recording the value of a position at its market value. When the

market value changes by a certain percentage, the repo position is adjusted

accordingly. Suppose that a dealer firm borrows \$20 million using collateral

with a market value of \$20.8 million, so that the margin is 4%. Suppose

further that the market value of the collateral drops to \$20.1 million. A repo

agreement can specify either a margin call or repricing of the repo. In the

case of a margin call, the dealer firm is required to put up additional

collateral with a market value of \$700,000 to bring the margin up to

\$800,000. If repricing is agreed on, the parties to the transaction adjust the

amount of the collateral in the transaction to the correct margin level. The

dealer then sends the customer sufficient funds so that the loan's new

amount is in line with the collateral's market value.

One concern in structuring a repo is delivery of the collateral to the

lender. The most obvious procedure is for the borrower to deliver the

collateral to the lender. At the end of the repo term, the lender returns the

collateral to the borrower in exchange for the principal and interest

payment. This procedure may be too costly, though, particularly for shortterm repos, because of the costs associated with delivering the collateral.

The cost of delivery is factored into the transaction in the form of a

lower repo rate offered by the borrower. The risk of the lender not taking

possession of the collateral is that the borrower may sell the security or use

the same security as collateral for a repo with another party.

As an alternative to delivering the collateral, the lender may agree to

allow the borrower to hold the security in a segregated customer account.

Of course, the lender still faces the risk that the borrower may use the

collateral fraudulently by offering it as collateral for another repo

transaction.

Another method is for the borrower to deliver the collateral to the

lender's custodial account at the borrower's clearing bank. The custodian

then takes possession of the collateral, which it holds on behalf of the

lender. This practice reduces the cost of delivery, because it is merely a

transfer within the borrower's clearing bank. If, for example, a dealer enters

into an overnight repo with customer A, the next day the collateral is

transferred back to the dealer. The dealer can then enter into a repo with

customer B for, say, five days without having to redeliver the collateral. The

clearing bank simply establishes a custodian account for customer B and

holds the collateral in that account. This arrangement is called a **tri-party**

.

**agreement**

With this understanding of repos, we can appreciate the run in the repo

market that Gorton and Metrick [12] report occurred in the interbank funding

market during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. During the crisis, banks

raised the amount of the haircut on repos, particularly when the collateral

was illiquid, low-credit-quality assets, such as a pool of subprime mortgage

loans. To see the impact of increasing the haircut, consider once again a

dealer firm that borrows \$20 million using collateral with a market value of

\$20.8 million and a margin of 4%. The proceeds received by the borrower

come to \$20 million. Suppose that at the end of the term, the lender wants a

10% margin rather than 4%. Then for collateral of \$20.8 million, the margin

- r haircut would be $18,909,091 ($20.8 million/1.10) instead of \$20
million. That is, \$1,090,909 less in proceeds will be received by the dealer
firm from the repo agreement. Now suppose that the dealer firm in our
illustration is a bank and is using the repo market to obtain funds. Hence,
the bank will receive \$1,090,909 less in proceeds as a result of a higher
haircut, which, as argued by Gorton and Metrick, is effectively a run on the
repo market.

```
Participants in the Market

```

Because it is used by dealer firms (investment banking firms and money

center banks acting as dealers) to finance positions and cover short

positions, the repo market represents one of the largest sectors of the money

market. Financial and nonfinancial firms participate in the market as both

sellers and buyers of collateral, depending on the circumstances they face.

Depository institutions (commercial banks and thrifts) are typically net

sellers of collateral (i.e., net borrowers of funds); money market funds

(MMFs), bank trust departments, municipalities, and corporations are

typically net buyers of collateral (i.e., providers of funds).

Even though banks and dealer firms use the repo market as the primary

means for financing inventory and covering short positions, they also use

the repo market to run a **matched book** by taking on repos and reverse

repos with the same maturity. A dealer firm uses a matched book to capture

the spread at which it enters into the repo and reverse repo agreements. For

example, suppose that a dealer firm enters into a term repo of 10 days with

an MMF and a reverse repo with a thrift for 10 days in which the collateral

is identical. In this transaction, the dealer firm borrows funds from the

MMF and lends money to the thrift. If the repo rate is 3.5% and the reverse

repo rate is 3.55%, the dealer firm borrows at 3.5% and lends at 3.55%,

locking in a spread of 0.05% (five basis points).

Another participant is the **repo broker.** To understand the role of the

repo broker, suppose a dealer firm shorts \$50 million of a security. It then

surveys its regular customers to determine whether it can borrow by means

- f a reverse repo the security it shorted. Suppose that it cannot find a
customer willing to do a repo transaction (a repo from the customer's point

- f view, a reverse repo from the dealer's). At that point, the dealer firm uses
the services of a repo broker.

The Federal Reserve is also involved in the repo market. The Fed

influences short-term interest rates through its open market operations, that

is, by the outright purchase or sale of government securities. This practice is

not commonly followed by the Fed, however. Instead it uses the repo

market to implement monetary policy by purchasing or selling collateral.

By buying collateral (i.e., lending funds), the Fed injects money into the

financial markets, thereby exerting downward pressure on short-term

interest rates. When the Fed buys collateral for its own account, it is called

a **system repo** . The Fed also buys collateral on behalf of foreign central

banks in repo transactions referred to as **customer repos** . It is primarily

through system repos that the Fed attempts to influence short-term rates. By

selling securities from its own account, the Fed drains money from the

financial markets, thereby exerting upward pressure on short-term interest

rates. This transaction is called a **matched sale** .

Note the language used to describe the transactions of the Fed in the

repo market. When the Fed lends funds based on collateral, we call it a

"system" or "customer repo," not a "reverse repo." Borrowing funds using

collateral is called a "matched sale," not a "repo." The jargon is confusing,

which is why we used the terms "buying collateral" and "selling collateral"

to describe what parties in the market are doing.

```
Determinants of the Repo Rate

```

Repo rates vary from transaction to transaction, depending on the following

factors:

    _Quality._ The higher the credit quality and liquidity of the collateral

are, the lower the repo rate will be.

    _Term of the repo._ The effect of the term of the repo on the rate

depends on the shape of the yield curve.

    _Delivery requirement._ As noted earlier, if delivery of the collateral to

the lender is required, the repo rate will be lower. If the collateral can

be deposited with the bank of the borrower, a higher repo rate is paid.

    - _Availability of collateral._ The more difficult it is to obtain the

collateral, the lower the repo rate will be. To understand why,

remember that the borrower (or equivalently, the seller of the

collateral) may have a security that is a hot or special issue. The party

that needs the collateral will be willing to lend funds at a lower repo

rate to obtain the collateral. Collateral is classified as generic collateral

and special collateral. **Generic collateral** refers to collateral that is

readily available to borrow in the market. When the collateral is

difficult to acquire, it is said to be **special collateral** (or **hot**

**collateral** ). The repo rate is less for special collateral than for generic

collateral.

Although these factors determine the repo rate on a particular

transaction, the federal funds rate determines the general level of repo rates.

The repo rate will be below the federal funds rate, because a repo involves

collateralized borrowing, whereas a federal funds transaction is unsecured

borrowing.

**`Negative repo rates`** We discuss negative interest rates in chapter 16.
Negative repo rates can occur in so-called normal markets, especially in
Europe. When collateral becomes special collateral, this is an indication of
exceptionally high borrowing demand in the repo market and, as a result,
repo rates can become negative. This is more common in countries where
the general level of interest rates is at or near zero. Another set of
conditions that can induce negative repo rates is financial distress, which
serves as a prime breeding ground for negative repo rates. During episodes

- f financial distress, even general collateral rates can turn negative due to
high demand for these securities as safe havens. A negative repo rate means
the cash lender pays repo interest to the cash borrower, because the
repurchase price is less than the purchase price.

Suppose a customer has excess cash of €10,000,000 with no immediate

use for the funds for two weeks. Also suppose a dealer wants to finance a

€10,000,000 par value position in sovereign debt for two weeks. The repo

margin is 2%, and the repo rate is −0.25%. The amount lent in this

transaction is €10,000,000/1.02 or €9,803,921.57. This value is the

purchase price. The repurchase price is the purchase price plus repo interest

for two weeks. Repo interest is given by €9,803,921.57 × (−0.0025) ×

14/360, or—€953.16. The repurchase price is €9,802,968.41. The following

summarizes this repo when there are negative repo rates:

Purchase price     €9,803,921.57 (€10,000,000/1.02)

Purchase date     Day 1

Repurchase date   Day 15

Repurchase price   €9,802,968.41

Repo rate       −0.25

Repo interest     −€953.16 = €9,803,9212.57 × (−0.0025) × 14/360.

When repo rates are positive, there is an incentive for the dealer (i.e., the

seller) to deliver collateral on the purchase date. A dealer failing to deliver

the collateral will not receive the purchase price until the collateral is

delivered. The dealer—regardless of whether the collateral is delivered—is

- bligated to pay the full amount of the repo interest to the customer (i.e., the
buyer) on the repurchase date. Paying interest on cash not available for use
provides a strong incentive to deliver the collateral. When repo rates are
negative, the incentive to deliver the collateral on the purchase date is gone.
In fact, negative repo rates reward failure of delivery, because the
repurchase price is less than the purchase price.

```
Commercial Paper Market

```

**Commercial paper** (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued
in the open market that represents the obligation of the issuing corporation.
The issuers of CP typically have a high credit rating. Both domestic and
foreign corporations issue CP in the United States. CP issued by foreign
entities is called a **Yankee CP** . MMFs purchase roughly one-third of all CP
issued. Pension funds, state and local governments, and nonfinancial

corporations seeking short-term investments purchase the balance. Little

secondary trading of CP takes place. Typically, an investor in CP is an

entity that plans to hold it until maturity, which is understandable, because

an investor can purchase CP in a direct transaction with the issuer, who sells

paper with the specific maturity that the investor desires.

The issuance of CP is an alternative to bank borrowing for large

corporations with strong credit ratings. It is the largest short-term debt

instrument issued in the financial market. The original purpose of CP was to

provide short-term funds for seasonal and working capital needs, but

companies use this instrument for other purposes. It has been used for

bridge financing. For example, suppose that a corporation needs long-term

funds to build a plant or acquire equipment. Rather than raising long-term

funds immediately, the corporation may elect to postpone the offering until

more favorable capital market conditions prevail. The funds raised by

issuing CP are used until longer-term securities are sold. In the United

States, the maturity of CP is typically less than 270 days, with most

maturing in less than 90 days. Several reasons explain this pattern of

maturities. First, the Securities Act of 1933 requires that securities be

registered with the SEC. Special provisions in the 1933 act exempt CP from

registration as long as the maturity does not exceed 270 days. Hence, to

avoid the costs associated with registering issues with the SEC, firms rarely

issue CP with maturities exceeding 270 days. Another consideration when

determining the maturity is whether the CP would be eligible collateral for

a bank borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window. To be

eligible, the maturity of the paper may not exceed 90 days. Because eligible

paper trades at a lower cost than paper that is not eligible, firms prefer to

issue paper whose maturity does not exceed 90 days.

To pay off holders of maturing CP, issuers generally use the proceeds

- btained by selling new CP. This process is often described as "rolling over
short-term paper." The risk that the investor in CP faces is that the issuer
will be unable to sell new CP at maturity and, as a result, unable to obtain
financing to pay off the investors in the maturity CP. This risk is referred to
as **rollover risk** . As a safeguard against rollover risk, CP issued in the
United States is typically backed by unused bank credit lines. The

commitment fee that the bank charges for providing a credit line increases

the effective cost of issuing CP.

Credit rating agencies evaluate the credit risk of CP and assign a letter

rating based on the likelihood of default. The ratings assigned to CP by

Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch are shown in table

25.2.

Issuers in the CP Market

```

The CP market is categorized by sector according to the type of issuer:

financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, and asset-backed

commercial paper (ABCP). As shown in the following table, as of October

2017, in the United States there was U.S. \$1,009.5 trillion of CP

- utstanding, according to the Federal Reserve. The breakdown between the
various categories of commercial paper both domestic and foreign was (in
billions of U.S. dollars): [13]

Nonfinancial Financial

Total Domestic Foreign Total Domestic Foreign Asset-Backed Other

290.4 228.6 61.8 476.6 213.4 263.2 242.0 0.4

As we can see from the table above, financial entities are the dominant

issuers of CP. Three types of financial companies issue CP: bank-related

finance companies, captive finance companies, and independent finance

companies. A bank holding company may have a subsidiary finance

company that provides loans to enable individuals and businesses to acquire

a wide range of products. Captive finance companies are subsidiaries of

equipment manufacturing companies. Their primary purpose is to secure

financing for the customers of the parent company. Independent finance

companies are not subsidiaries of equipment manufacturing firms or bank

holding companies.

The appendix to this chapter describes the asset-backed commercial

paper market.

Although financial entities now dominate the issuance of CP,

nonfinancial corporations dominated the CP market in the early years of its

development. The major issuers were utility and transportation companies.

By 1992, the financial sector dominated the market. At the beginning of the

financial crisis, in mid-2007, the financial sector accounted for more than

92% of CP issuance. [14]

Identifying the reasons for the shift in dominance from nonfinancial

sector issuers to financial sector issuers has been the focus of several

studies. One study found that the shift could be attributed to three factors. [15]

The first factor was nonfinancial companies' aggressive pursuit of policies

to reduce their holdings in inventory. As holdings declined, there was less

need to obtain short-term borrowing (such as CP) to fund inventory

positions. The second factor was an increased tendency of nonfinancial

companies to take advantage of relatively low interest rates to issue longterm bonds. This corporate management financial strategy removed the

uncertainty about the risk of having to refinance at future interest rates that

might be higher. Finally, the credit quality of issuers decreased, and the

tolerance of investors for credit risk also decreased.

This shift from nonfinancial issuers to financial issuers has important

implications, particularly in light of the discussion of the future of the

interbank funding market earlier in this chapter. In fact, some now argue

that the CP market is the new interbank funding market.

```
Directly Placed versus Dealer-Placed Paper

```

CP is classified as either directly placed paper or dealer placed paper.

**Directly placed paper** is sold by the issuing firm directly to investors

without the help of an agent or an intermediary. (An issuer may set up its

- wn dealer firm to handle sales.) Most issuers of direct paper are financial
companies. These entities require continuous funds to enable them to
provide loans to customers. As a result, they find it cost effective to
establish a sales force to sell their CP directly to investors. General Electric
Capital Corporation (GE Capital) is an example of a direct issuer, having
issued CP for more than 50 years. GE Capital is the principal financial
services arm of General Electric Company and is the largest and most active
direct issuer in the United States.

**Dealer-placed CP** requires the services of an agent to sell an issuer's
paper. CP agents are large securities dealer firms and subsidiaries of bank
holding companies. Typically, nonfinancial companies and smaller financial
companies use this avenue for issuing CP, because the amount and
frequency at which they need to borrow cannot justify maintaining a sales
force. The agent distributes the paper on a best-efforts underwriting basis
(for more on best-efforts underwriting, see chapter 9) by investment
banking firms.

```
Tier 1 and Tier 2 Paper

```

A major investor in CP is MMFs, which we describe later. The SEC

imposes restrictions on the investments made by these entities. Specifically,

Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 limits the credit risk

exposure of money market mutual funds by restricting their investments to

"eligible" paper. Eligibility is defined in terms of the CP credit ratings

shown in table 25.2. To be eligible paper, the issue must carry one of the

two highest ratings (1 or 2) from at least two of the nationally recognized

statistical rating organizations. Tier 1 paper is defined as eligible paper that

is rated 1 by at least two of the rating organizations; Tier 2 paper security is

defined as eligible paper that is not a Tier 1 security.

MMFs may hold no more than 5% of their assets in the Tier 1 paper of

any individual issuer and no more than 1% of their assets in the Tier 2 paper

- f any individual issuer. Furthermore, holdings of Tier 2 paper may not
represent more than 5% of the fund's assets.

```
Defaults in the CP Market

```

From its beginnings until 1970, the CP market grew continuously, with no

real crisis. In June 1970, a major issuer of CP at the time, Penn Central

Railroad, with \$84 million outstanding, faced financial difficulties, which

raised concerns in the CP market. Because of the importance of the CP

market, the federal government provided assistance that permitted Penn

Central to repay maturing CP. The plan failed, and one year, later Penn

Central filed for bankruptcy.

Despite recessionary periods, the years that followed the Penn Central

episode saw the market grow in terms of issuance, fostered by the growth in

MMFs, which were the major investors in CP. It was not until 1982 that the

market saw its first default since Penn Central, the default by Johns

Manville Corporation. [16] That was followed by three defaults in 1989 and

three more in 1990. [17] The defaults in 1989 prompted federal legislation to

tighten the rules for the purchasing of CP by MMFs that we described

earlier (i.e., SEC Rule 2a-7). Fast-forward to the fall of 2007: The subprime

mortgage crisis in the United States brought down the growth of the ABCP

market. As explained in the appendix to this chapter, this sector of the CP

market provided funding for the issuance of securitized products,

particularly subprime mortgage–backed securities that we describe in

chapter 30. Failures in this market by issuers of ABCP closed down this

market sector. Another key event in the CP market was the bankruptcy of

Lehman Brothers in September 2008. As a result of these events, by fall

2008, market participants were concerned about the ability of the CP

market to survive, given the demands placed on it. Investors reallocated

their short-term investments from the CP market to MMFs that held only

government securities.

Because of the importance of this market, federal programs were

enacted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Fed to address two

potential problems caused by the failures in the CP market. The first

problem was the concern that financial issuers of CP would not make

timely payments to investors on their obligation at the maturity date and

would thereby extend the maturity date. To deal with this concern, the Fed

instituted several lending programs during the financial crisis, but the two

principal ones dealing with the CP market were the Commercial Paper

Funding Facility and the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market

Fund Liquidity Facility, both created in September 2008. The programs

involved the purchase by the Fed of CP, the first time in the Fed's history

that it had been a purchaser of this type of asset. The Fed's participation,

which began at the end of October 2008, stabilized the CP market. As a

result of the Fed's participation, it became the largest single investor in CP

by January 2009. The Fed held 22% of outstanding CP at that time, but it

subsequently reduced its holdings to 3.4% by October 2009. [18]

The second problem lay in the potential impact on the major holders of

commercial MMFs. As explained later, these collective investment vehicles

are designed to maintain a net asset value (NAV) of \$1. The concern was

that these funds would suspend redemption of shares as a consequence of

problems with their CP holdings. When we discuss MMFs later in the

chapter, we will describe what the federal government did to address the

second concern.

```
Yields on CP

```

CP may be issued in either a discount form or an interest-bearing form. In a

discount form, the investor buys the paper at less than face value and when

it matures receives the face value. The difference between the face value

and the purchase price is the interest. When the paper is issued in interestbearing form, it is purchased from the issuer at face value and a specified

interest rate. At maturity, the investor receives the face value plus the

accrued interest based on the specified interest rate.

The yield offered on CP tracks that of other money market instruments.

There are three reasons that the yield on CP is higher than that on shortterm U.S. Treasury securities for the same maturity. First, the investor in CP

is exposed to credit risk. Second, interest earned from investing in Treasury

bills is exempt from state and local income taxes; as a result, CP must offer

a higher yield to offset this tax disadvantage relative to Treasury bills.

Finally, CP is less liquid than Treasury bills. The liquidity premium

demanded may be small, however, because investors typically follow a buyand-hold strategy with CP and so are less concerned with liquidity.

```
Non-U.S. CP Markets

```

Non-U.S. corporations issue CP in the U.S. market, which, as noted earlier,

is referred to as "Yankee CP." Other countries have developed their own CP

markets for companies domiciled in their country and for foreign

companies. For example, in Japan, CP can be issued by Japanese

corporations in Japan's domestic market and yen-dominated CP can be

issued by non-Japanese entities. The latter CP is referred to as Samurai CP.

According to the Asian Development Bank, other Asian countries that issue

CP are Malaysia and the Philippines. Although domestic commercial paper

has developed in some European countries (especially in France, Spain, and

the United Kingdom), the eurocommercial paper (ECP) market is the

market of choice for many European CP issuers. ECP is short-term

unsecured debt issued in Euromarkets with maturities of 1 to 360 days. As

- f June 2016, financial ECP was U.S. \$325.73 billion, and corporate ECP
stood at \$21.99 billion, according to the European Central Bank.

ECP is issued and placed outside the jurisdiction of the currency of

denomination. U.S. CP and ECP differ with respect to the characteristics of

the paper and the structure of the market. First, CP issued in the United

States usually has a maturity of less than 270 days, with the most common

maturity ranging from 30 to 50 days or less. The maturity of ECP can be

considerably longer. The average maturity of ECP is about twice as long as

U.S. commercial paper. Second, although an issuer in the United States

must have unused bank credit lines, it is possible to issue ECP without such

backing in the ECP market. Third, ECP sports a wider distribution of issuer

credit quality. Unlike most U.S. CP, most ECP is not rated. Fourth, in the

United States, CP can be directly placed or dealer placed, but ECP is almost

always dealer placed. ECP is issued on a best-efforts basis through a

syndicate of dealers. The fifth distinction is that numerous dealers

participate in the ECP market, whereas only a few dealers dominate the

market in the United States. Finally, because of the longer maturity of ECP,

it is traded more often in the secondary market than is U.S. CP. Investors in

CP in the United States typically buy and hold to maturity, and the

secondary market is thin and illiquid.

```
Large-Denomination Negotiable Certificates of Deposit

```

A **certificate of deposit** (CD) represents a financial obligation issued by a

depository institution that indicates a specified sum of money deposited at

the issuing depository institution. Depository institutions issue CDs to raise

funds for financing their business activities. A CD bears a maturity date and

a specified interest rate. It can be issued in any denomination. CDs issued

by a depository are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

(FDIC), but only for amounts up to \$250,000 per account. CDs are not

subject to any limit on the maximum maturity, but by Federal Reserve

regulations, CDs cannot have a maturity of less than seven days.

A CD may be nonnegotiable or negotiable. In the former case, the initial

depositor must wait until the maturity date of the CD to obtain the funds. If

the depositor chooses to withdraw funds prior to the maturity date, an early

withdrawal penalty is imposed. In contrast, a negotiable CD allows the

initial depositor (or any subsequent owner of the CD) to sell the CD in the

- pen market prior to the maturity date. The negotiable CDs purchased by
institutional investors are **large-denomination negotiable CDs** that
typically have a denomination of \$10 million or more.

Our focus here is on the large-denomination negotiable CDs, and we

refer to them simply as "CDs." The largest group of investors in such CDs

consists of MMFs.

```
CD Issuers

```

CDs can be classified into four categories, according to the issuing

institution. First are CDs issued by domestic banks. Second are CDs

denominated in U.S. dollars but issued outside the United States. These

CDs are called **Eurodollar CDs**, or **euro CDs.** A third category of CD is

the **Yankee CD**, a CD denominated in U.S. dollars and issued by a foreign

bank with a branch in the United States. Finally, **thrift CDs** are issued by

S&Ls and savings banks.

Money center banks and large regional banks are the primary issuers of

domestic CDs. Most CDs are issued with a maturity of less than one year.

Those issued with a maturity greater than one year are called **term CDs** .

Unlike Treasury bills, commercial paper, and banker's acceptances

(discussed later), the yields on domestic CDs are quoted on an interest

bearing basis. CDs with a maturity of one year or less pay interest at

maturity. For purposes of calculating interest, a year is treated as having

360 days. Term CDs issued in the United States normally pay interest

semiannually, again with a year taken as 360 days.

With a **floating-rate CD**, the interest rate changes periodically in

accordance with a predetermined formula that indicates the spread (or

margin) above some index at which the rate will reset periodically.

Floating-rate CDs may reset the coupon daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,

- r semiannually. Typically, floating-rate CDs have maturities of 18 months
to five years.

Euro CDs are U.S. dollar-denominated CDs issued primarily in London

by U.S., Canadian, European, and Japanese banks.

```
CD Yields

```

The yields posted on CDs vary, depending on three factors: (1) the credit

rating of the issuing bank, (2) the maturity of the CD, and (3) the supply of

and demand for CDs. With respect to the third factor, banks and thrifts issue

CDs as part of their liability management strategy, so the supply of CDs

will be driven by the demand for bank loans and the cost of alternative

sources of capital to fund these loans. Moreover, bank loan demand depends

- n the cost of alternative funding sources, such as CP. When loan demand is
weak, CD rates decline. When demand is strong, the rates rise. The effect of
maturity depends on the shape of the yield curve, a topic we covered in

**.**
chapter 16

Credit risk is an important consideration, as the amount of the deposit of

a large-denomination negotiable CD far exceeds the maximum FDIC

insurance. At one time, domestic CDs issued by money center banks traded

- n a "no-name basis" (i.e., they offered a uniform yield regardless of the
issuing money center bank). Recent financial crises in the banking industry,
however, caused investors to take a closer look at issuing banks. **Prime**
**CDs** (those issued by highly rated domestic banks) trade at a lower yield
than **nonprime CDs** (those issued by lower-rated domestic banks). Because

- f investors' unfamiliarity with foreign banks, generally Yankee CDs trade
at a higher yield than do domestic CDs.

Euro CDs offer a higher yield than domestic CDs for three reasons.

First, the Federal Reserve imposes reserve requirements on CDs issued by

U.S. banks that do not apply to issuers of euro CDs. The reserve

requirement effectively raises the cost of funds to the issuing bank, because

it cannot invest all the proceeds it receives from the issuance of a CD, and

the amount that must be kept as reserves will not earn a return for the bank.

Because it earns less on funds raised by selling domestic CDs, the domestic

issuing bank pays less on its domestic CD than on a euro CD. Second, the

bank issuing the CD must pay an insurance premium to the FDIC, which

again raises the cost of funds. Finally, euro CDs are dollar obligations

payable by an entity operating in a foreign jurisdiction, exposing the

holders to a risk (referred to as "sovereign risk") that their claim may not be

enforced by the foreign jurisdiction. As a result, a portion of the spread

between the yield offered on euro CDs and domestic CDs reflects what can

be termed a "sovereign risk premium." This premium varies with the degree

- f confidence in the international banking system.

CD yields are higher than yields on Treasury securities of the same

maturity. The spread is due mainly to the credit risk that a CD investor is

exposed to and the fact that CDs offer less liquidity. The spread resulting

from credit risk varies with both economic conditions and confidence in the

banking system, increasing during a "flight to quality" (which means

investors shift their funds in significant amounts to debt of high quality or

little risk) or a crisis in the banking system.

```
Banker’s Acceptances

```

A **banker's acceptance** (BA) is a financial instrument created to facilitate

commercial trade transactions. This financial instrument is referred to as a

BA because the issuing bank accepts the ultimate responsibility to repay a

loan to the holder of the financial instrument. The use of BAs to finance a

commercial transaction is referred to as **acceptance financing**, and BAs are

accordingly sometimes referred to as "acceptances."

The transactions in which BAs are created include (1) the importing of

goods into the United States, (2) the exporting of goods from the United

States to foreign entities, (3) the storing and shipping of goods between two

foreign countries where neither the importer nor the exporter is a U.S.

firm, [19] and (4) the storing and shipping of goods between two entities in the

United States. As demonstrated in the following illustration, maturities are

typically arranged to cover the time required to ship and dispose of the

goods being financed.

BAs are sold on a discounted basis, just as Treasury bills and CP are. To

calculate the rate to be charged the customer for issuing a BA, a bank

determines the rate for which it can sell its BA in the open market. To this

rate it adds a commission.

```
Illustration of the Creation of a BA

```

The best way to explain the creation of a BA is by an illustration. Several

entities are involved in our hypothetical transaction:

   - Car Imports Corporation of American (Car Imports), a firm in New
Jersey that sells automobiles;

   - Germany Fast Autos Inc. (GFA), a manufacturer of automobiles in
Germany;

  - First Hoboken Bank (Hoboken Bank), a commercial bank in
Hoboken, New Jersey;

   - Berlin National Bank (Berlin Bank), a bank in Germany; and
  - High-Caliber Money Market Fund, a mutual fund in the United
States that invests in money market instruments.

Car Imports and GFA are considering a commercial transaction. Car

Imports wants to import 15 cars manufactured by GFA. GFA is concerned

with the ability of Car Imports to make payment on the 15 cars when they

are received. Acceptance financing is suggested as a means for facilitating

the transaction. Car Imports offers \$300,000 for the 15 cars. The terms of

the sale stipulate payment to be made to GFA 60 days after it ships the 15

cars to Car Imports. GFA determines whether it is willing to accept the

\$300,000. When considering the offering price, GFA must calculate the

present value of the \$300,000, because it will not be receiving payment

until 60 days after shipment. Suppose that GFA agrees to these terms.

Car Imports arranges with its bank, Hoboken Bank, to issue a letter of

credit. The letter of credit indicates that Hoboken Bank will make good on

the payment of \$300,000 that Car Imports must make to GFA 60 days after

shipment. The letter of credit, or time draft, will be sent by Hoboken Bank

to GFA’s bank, Berlin Bank. On receipt of the letter of credit, Berlin Bank

will notify GFA, which will then ship the 15 cars. After the cars are

shipped, GFA presents the shipping documents to Berlin Bank and receives

the present value of \$300,000. GFA is now out of the picture.

Berlin Bank presents the time draft and the shipping documents to

Hoboken Bank. The latter will then stamp "accepted" on the time draft. By

doing so, Hoboken Bank creates a BA and agrees to pay the holder of this

BA \$300,000 at the maturity date. Car Imports receives the shipping

documents so that it can procure the 15 cars once it signs a note or some

- ther type of financing arrangement with Hoboken Bank.

At this point, the holder of this BA is the Berlin Bank. It has two

choices. It can continue to hold the BA as an investment in its loan

portfolio, or it can request that Hoboken Bank make a payment of the

present value of \$300,000. Let's assume that Berlin Bank requests payment

- f the present value of \$300,000.

Now the holder of this BA is Hoboken Bank. It has two choices: retain

the BA as an investment as part of its loan portfolio or sell it to an investor.

Suppose that Hoboken Bank chooses the latter, and that High-Caliber

Money Market Fund is seeking a high-quality investment with the same

maturity as that of the BA. Hoboken Bank sells the BA to the MMF at the

present value of \$300,000. Rather than sell the instrument directly to an

investor, Hoboken Bank could sell it to a dealer, who would then resell it to

an investor, such as an MMF. In either case, at the maturity date, the MMF

presents the BA to Hoboken Bank, receiving \$300,000, which the bank in

turn recovers from Car Imports.

```
Accepting Banks

```

Banks that create BAs are called **accepting banks** . Banker's acceptances

can be distributed through a dealer market, which involves 15 to 20 large

firms, most of which are headquartered in New York City. The larger

regional banks maintain their own sales forces to sell the BAs they create

but will use dealers to distribute those they cannot sell.

```
Eligible BAs

```

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve classifies a BA as either an

eligible or an ineligible BA. The classification is important. There are two

types of eligible BAs. The first is an eligible BA that a bank uses as

collateral for a loan at the Fed's discount window. Regulation A of the Fed

sets forth the eligibility requirements. The second type of eligible BA is one

that the Federal Open Market Committee is permitted to purchase.

Regulation B sets forth the eligibility requirements.

One requirement for eligibility is maturity, which, with a few exceptions,

cannot exceed six months. Although the other requirements for eligibility

are too detailed to review here, the basic principle is simple. [20] The candidate

BA should be financing a self-liquidating commercial transaction.

Eligibility is also important because the Fed imposes a reserve

requirement on funds raised by means of BAs that are ineligible. BAs sold

by an accepting bank are potential liabilities of the bank, but no reserve

requirements are imposed for eligible BAs. Consequently, most BAs satisfy

the various eligibility criteria. Finally, the Federal Reserve also imposes a

limit on the amount of eligible BAs that may be issued by a bank.

Although the Fed no longer purchases BAs as part of its open market

- perations, this has not always been the case. There is a history of the Fed's
participation in the BA market dating back to the beginning of the creation

- f the Federal Reserve System in 1916 with the goal of developing this
sector of the money market to compete with the banks in London. At that
time, the Fed actively discounted BAs and purchased eligible BAs. In fact,
during one period in U.S. history, the Fed's open market policy involved the
purchase of only BAs. [21]

```
Credit Risk

```

Investing in BAs exposes the investor to the credit risk that neither the

borrower nor the accepting bank will be able to pay the principal due at the

maturity date. The market interest rates that BAs offer investors reflect this

risk, because BAs have higher yields than risk-free Treasury bills. A yield

may also include a premium for relative illiquidity. The yield on a BA has

such a premium because its secondary market is far less developed than that

- f a Treasury bill. Hence, the spread between rates on BAs and rates on
Treasury bills represents a combined reward to investors for bearing the
higher risk and relative illiquidity of a BA. That spread is not constant over
time. The change in the spread reveals shifting investor valuation of the risk
and illiquidity differences between the assets.

```
Money Market Funds

```

Now that we have described money market instruments, we conclude this

chapter by discussing a major institutional investor that participates in the

money market: MMFs. In chapter 32, we explain mutual funds (open-end

funds), a type of registered investment vehicle and one type of collective

investment vehicle. In the category of mutual funds is one type that invests

- nly in financial instruments that have a maturity of one year or less. These
mutual funds are called **money market funds** and are approaching \$3
trillion under management.

Although we have mentioned the role of MMFs as investors many times

throughout this chapter, because MMFs are viewed as cash equivalents,

they appeal to retail and institutional investors seeking highly liquid shortterm investment vehicles. The portfolio managers of MMFs have an

investment objective of obtaining the highest potential return consistent

with the restrictions on the types of money market instruments in which

they may invest and maintain an NAV of \$1 at all times. Historically, it has

been the \$1 stable NAV objective that MMFs maintain under Rule 2a-7 that

has appealed to investors and resulted in the dramatic growth in MMFs. The

concern of investors is that the portfolio might include money market

instruments whose market value declines significantly such that the NAV

declines below \$1 (referred to as "breaking the buck"). A typical warning

given to potential investors about the risk associated with investing in an

MMF which appears in the prospectus of an MMF is: "An investment in a

money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit

Insurance Corporation. The fund seeks to preserve the value of your

investment at \$1.00 per share. However, it is possible to realize a loss of

capital by investing in the fund. This is because interest rate increases can

cause the price of money market securities and hence the fund's value to

decrease."

MMFs are regulated by the SEC because of their crucial role in the

financial system. For example, earlier we described SEC Rule 2a-7, which

restricts the types of CP that can be purchased by MMFs. Because of the

problems that occurred with MMFs in the 2008–2009 financial crisis,

legislation has been adopted and other legislation proposed for regulating

MMFs, as we discuss later in this section.

```
Types of MMFs

```

MMFs are classified according to the types of money market instruments in

which the fund manager may invest. The first classification is based on the

tax treatment of the money market instruments that may be included in the

portfolio. Taxable MMFs invest in the private money market instruments

described earlier in this chapter, as well as in Treasury securities and federal

agency securities. Tax-free MMFs invest in the money market instruments

issued by state and local governments, which are described in chapter 32.

Taxable and tax-free MMFs are classified further, again based on the

types of money market instruments in which they are permitted to invest.

Taxable MMFs fall into three categories: those that invest only in Treasury

securities, those that invest in Treasury and agency securities, and those that

invest in Treasury and agency securities and the private money market

instruments described in this chapter.

Taxable MMFs that invest in Treasury securities, agency securities, and

the private money market instruments described in this chapter are referred

to **as prime money market funds** . With respect to credit risk, prime MMFs

carry greater risk than taxable MMFs that invest in Treasury securities only

- r those that invest in Treasury securities and agency securities.
Accordingly, the potential yield is higher for prime MMFs.

Tax-free MMFs are categorized as national municipal MMFs and state

municipal MMFs. **National municipal MMFs** invest in high-quality, shortterm municipal money market instruments that are typically exempt from

federal income taxes. **State municipal MMF** s restrict the holdings to

instruments of the designated state.

```
SEC MMF Rules Adopted and Proposed as a Result of the Financial Crisis

```

Because of the importance of the money market to the financial market and,

in turn, the critical role of MMFs as suppliers of capital to the money

market, MMFs are highly regulated by the SEC so as to reduce the interest

rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk faced by investors in this collective

investment vehicle. Before the financial crisis that began in 2007, only one

MMF had ever broken the buck (i.e., the NAV fell below \$1). That track

record since the development of the MMF made investors confident about

the safety of MMFs as a short-term investment vehicle. Events since the

financial crisis, coupled with recent reports on how other MMFs would

have broken the buck had it not been for support by the MMF's sponsor,

prompted further regulation.

In 2008 one prime MMF, the Reserve Primary Fund, a \$65 billion fund,

became the second MMF to break the buck. The reason for this was the

investment of this fund in CP by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. We recall

here that reserve funds can invest in CP in addition to Treasury and federal

agency financial instruments. Reserve Primary Fund, which had a \$785

million position in Lehman’s CP when that firm failed on September 15,

2008, did not have sufficient assets to ensure that holders of their shares

could redeem them at \$1 per share. The failure of Lehman Brothers resulted

in a share price (NAV) of \$0.97, a loss of 3%. As a result, there were

massive redemptions, the equivalent to a run on a bank. To meet the

demand for redemptions, the fund’s portfolio manager liquidated

investments in a money market that was already in a panic mode. The

problem faced by the Reserve Primary Fund then spread to other MMFs,

resulting in redemptions of about \$310 billion from prime MMFs (primarily

by institutional investors) during the week of Lehman Brothers' failure. [22]

However, at least two studies have reported that many more MMFs were

in danger of breaking the buck were it not for the support of the MMF's

sponsors. In a 2012 Staff Report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,

the authors of the report found that in September and October 2008, the

losses for at least 29 MMFs were large enough to cause them to break the

buck without the support of the sponsor of the MMF. [23] The average loss

would have been 2.2%. They found that at least five MMFs experienced

losses of 3% of assets. The Prime Reserve Fund, as noted above, lost 3%. A

2012 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that examined 341

prime MMFs from 2007 to 2011 found that at least 21 funds were spared

breaking the buck because of sponsorship support. [24] Each of the 21 MMFs

received support of about 0.5% of the fund's assets to maintain an NAV of

\$1.

Because of the important role of MMFs as suppliers of capital to

financial and nonfinancial corporations, the money market froze, and

corporations that relied on the issuance of CP faced funding problems. The

rippling impact of the failure of the Reserve Primary Fund on the MMF

industry and the money market itself resulted in government intervention.

The announcement of the U.S. Department of the Treasury of its Temporary

Treasury Money Market Guarantee Program in September 19, 2008, which

would temporarily provide a guarantee for all MMFs, halted the run on

MMFs.

As a first step to addressing regulatory concerns identified from the

financial crisis, the SEC adopted several rule changes for MMFs. The key

reforms that were adopted in February 2010 to better protect investors in

MMFs during periods of financial distress were

   - rules to enhance risk-limiting constraints on MMF portfolios,
   - procedures for facilitating the orderly redemption of MMF shares,
and

   - the imposition of constraints on repo agreements.

The rules to enhance risk-limiting constraints involved tightening credit

standards for MMF portfolio holdings, shortening the weighted average

maturity of holdings, and adopting liquidity requirements. The procedure

for orderly redemption was a new rule introduced with the goal of

mitigating systemic risk caused by breaking the buck. Under the new rule,

the portfolio manager of an MMF that is at risk for breaking the buck is

permitted to promptly suspend redemptions and liquidate its portfolio in an

- rderly manner.

Because of the importance of MMFs in repo agreements, the new rules

place more stringent constraints on the type of collateral that can be used.

As we noted earlier, in a repo agreement, the collateral can be cash or

securities (government securities or private debt instruments). The greater

constraints involve repurchase agreements where the collateral is a private

debt instrument.

To further improve safeguards for investors in MMFs, the _Report of the_

_President's Working Group on Financial Markets: Money Market Fund_

_Reform Options_ (hereafter the PWG report), published on October 21, 2010,

identified features of MMFs that made them susceptible to runs and

discussed issues related to systemic risk for prime MMFs. [25] Although it

endorsed the new rules adopted in February 2010, the PWG report

acknowledged that further reforms were needed to prevent the types of

market disruptions that had occurred in September 2008. More specifically,

the PWG report "undertook a study of possible further reforms that,

individually or in combination, might mitigate systemic risk by

complementing the SEC's changes to MMF regulation." [26]

The PWG report identified several policy options for further reducing

the risks of a run on an MMF, and it sought public comment on these

suggestions. The key policy options suggested in the PWG report include

the following:

   - Allow the NAV to float rather than be maintained at \$1 per share. It
is the vulnerability to breaking the buck that caused the run on MMFs
during the financial crisis.

  - Adopt a two-tier system of MMFs: (1) a stable-value NAV MMF
and (2) a floating-rate NAV MMF.

   - Require that MMFs establish a capital cushion.
   - Establish a private emergency liquidity facility.

In July 2014, the SEC adopted its new MMF rules in an 869-page

release. The two critical rules are (1) institutional prime and institutional

tax-exempt MMFs are required to value their portfolio securities at market

value and sell and redeem shares based on a floating NAV, and (2)

government MMFs and retail MMFs are permitted to continue to seek to

maintain a stable NAV at \$1.

```
Key Points

```

- Money market instruments are debt obligations that at issuance have a
maturity of one year or less.

   - The interbank funding market (interbank lending market) is the
market where unsecured and secured loans are made between banks.

   - Unsecured lending in the interbank funding market is done in the
federal funds market.

  - In the secured sector, lending is done by means of repurchase
agreements in the repo market.

   - In London, unsecured lending in the interbank funding market is
used to estimate the cost of borrowing by banks. The rate in this
market is the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).

   - Eurocurrency is any currency on deposit in banks outside their
country of origin.

   - LIBOR is calculated by the British Bankers' Association based on
rates reported by a panel of large banks for actual and estimated
borrowings.

  - The official LIBOR, reported for seven maturities and five
currencies, is the most important global interest rate benchmark
because of its use as a reference rate for interest rate derivatives and

the setting of business and consumer loan rates.

  - Manipulation of LIBOR by the panel banks resulted in
investigations by regulators and lawsuits filed by parties that claimed
financial damages as a consequence of the manipulation.

   - In the federal funds market, depository institutions borrow (buy) and
sell (lend) excess reserves held in the form of deposits in a Federal
Reserve Bank.

   - The interest rate for overnight loans of excess reserves as determined
in the fed funds market is the funds rate. The Fed establishes a target

level for this rate, and so it is not truly a market-determined rate.

- The Federal Reserve Bank pays interest on required reserves and a
higher interest rate on excess reserves.

- Disruptions in the interbank funding market during the financial
crisis raised the issue of whether this market will be viable in the

future.

- A repurchase agreement (or repo agreement) is a lending transaction
in which the borrower uses a security as collateral for the borrowing.
The transaction is referred to as a "repurchase agreement," because it
specifies the sale of a security and its subsequent repurchase at a future
date.

- For a repo agreement, the difference between the purchase
(repurchase) price and the sale price is the dollar interest cost of the
loan.

- An overnight repo is for one day; a loan for more than one day is
called a "term repo."

- The collateral in a repo may be a Treasury security, money market
instrument, federal agency security, or mortgage-backed security.

- The parties to a repo are exposed to credit risk, limited by margin
and the market-to-market practices included in the repo agreement.

- The Fed uses the repo market to implement monetary policy.
- Factors that determine the repo rate are the federal funds rate, the
credit quality and liquidity of the collateral, the term of the repo, the
delivery requirement, and the availability of the collateral.

- Repo rates can be negative in times of market stress and in normal
conditions when rates are near zero.

- Commercial paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note
issued in the open market that represents the obligation of the issuing
entity.

- Generally, CP has a maturity of less than 90 days.
- Financial and nonfinancial corporations issue CP, with most issued
by financial corporations.

- Directly placed CP is sold by the issuing firm directly to investors
without using an agent as an intermediary. For dealer-placed CP, the
issuer uses the services of an agent to sell its paper.

- Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) has been used to fund
assets using the securitization process. Unlike traditional
securitization, the special-purpose vehicle had to roll over the CP
issued and was also permitted to obtain additional assets financed by
the issuance of additional CP.

- Eurocommercial paper is issued and placed outside the jurisdiction
- f the currency of denomination; it differs from dollar-denominated
paper issued in the United States in several ways.

- Certificates of deposit (CDs) are issued by banks and thrifts to raise
funds for financing their business activities. Unlike other bank
deposits, CDs are negotiable in the secondary market. CDs can be
classified into four types: domestic CDs, Eurodollar CDs (or euro
CDs), Yankee CDs, and thrift CDs.

- A banker's acceptance is a vehicle created to facilitate commercial
trade transactions, particularly international transactions.

- The term "banker's acceptance" arises because a bank accepts the
responsibility to repay a loan to the holder of the vehicle created in a
commercial transaction in case the debtor fails to perform.

- Eligible banker's acceptances have an advantage in that they can be
used as collateral when borrowing from the Fed at its discount
window, and no reserves are required.

- Money market funds (MMFs) are major investors in money market
instruments. They are designed to maintain a \$1 NAV.

- There are two types of MMFs: taxable and tax-free.
- The three types of taxable MMFs are those that invest in (1) only
Treasury securities, (2) Treasury and federal agency securities, and (3)
Treasury, federal agency securities, and private money market
instruments (these are referred to as "prime MMFs").

- Tax-free MMFs are categorized as national municipal MMFs and
state municipal MMFs.

   - The concern with MMFs is that the portfolio selection could result in
the NAV falling below \$1 per share. Such an occurrence is referred to
as "breaking the buck."

  - Because of the importance of MMFs to the financial markets,
additional safeguards have been adopted by the SEC to enhance the
credit and liquidity of their portfolios.

   - New rules adopted by the SEC to improve the safety of MMFs are
based on whether the fund is an institutional prime, an institutional
tax-exempt, a government, or a retail MMF.

  - Institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt MMFs must be
valued at a floating-rate NAV. Government and retail MMFs are still
required to maintain a constant NAV of \$1.

```
Appendix: Asset-Backed Commercial Paper

```

In chapter 27, we will discuss the securitization process and the assetbacked securities (ABSs) that corporations can use to obtain debt funding.

When CP is issued as part of a securitization that has a short-term maturity,

then the CP is referred to as ABCP. [27] As in the case of corporate debt

- bligations, the distinction between ABSs and ABCP is primarily the tenure
- f the financial instrument. The former is a mediumto long-term asset,
whereas the latter has a short-term maturity.

In our description of ABSs in chapter 27, we explain that a pool of

short-term receivables (e.g., credit card receivables) can be purchased by a

special-purpose vehicle (SPV), and to fund the purchase of that pool of

short-term receivables, the SPV will issue ABSs that are mediumto longterm in maturity. In contrast, securitization can be used by an SPV to

finance a pool of longer-term receivables by issuing ABCP. The SPV's

- bjective in a securitization by issuing CP to fund the purchase of the
receivables pool is to generate a spread between the yield that can be earned

- n the pool of receivables and the cost of the funds paid to the holders of
the ABCP. Effectively, the SPV is employing a leveraged strategy just as a
depository institution does when it borrows funds on a short-term basis and
seeks to invest those funds to earn more than its fund cost.

A key distinction between the traditional securitization as described in

chapter 27 and the use of securitization to fund a pool of receivables using

ABCP has to do with ongoing funding and collateral (i.e., the pool of

receivables). In a traditional securitization, once the funding is obtained

(i.e., the ABSs are issued), there is no further need to obtain funding. That

is, the SPV purchased the pool of receivables using the ABSs issued. In

contrast, when ABCP is issued in a securitization, not only is it necessary

for the SPV to roll over the ABCP to finance the pool of receivables but the

securitization structure also involves adding to the receivables pool. That is,

the collateral can increase over time.

Banks have been the major issuers of ABCP, maintaining ongoing

ABCP programs. These are runs on the balance sheet of an entity

established by the bank called an **ABCP conduit**, which is a thinly

capitalized SPV. It is the conduit that continues to add more receivables and

to fund their purchase by issuing ABCP. Although banks have been the

major issuers of ABCP, nonbank entities have also issued CP. ABCP

conduits have been classified as either - r

**single-seller ABCP conduits**

**multiple-seller ABCP conduits** based on the number of originators that

provided receivables to the pool.

```
Risks Associated with Investing in ABCP

```

The rollover risk to the holder of an ABCP is the same as that for investors

in CP issued by nonfinancial corporations and financial corporations: the

inability to find investors who are willing to purchase newly issued ABCP

when the current ABCP matures. And it is for the same reason that liquidity

support is needed for ABCP, just as it is for CP issued by nonfinancial

corporations and financial corporations. ABCP is classified according to the

type of liquidity support and can be either fully supported or partly

supported by the bank that sponsors the ABCP program.

The disadvantage of a bank fully supporting its ABCP program is that

for regulatory purposes, the assets held by the conduit must be included as

part of the bank's assets for the determination of capital requirements. This

is a disadvantage in that it raises the funding cost of an ABCP program

because of reserves that must be held. Banks have developed variants of

fully supported conduits that, although receiving bank support, have not

been treated as such for regulatory purposes.

Another key risk is that ABCP conduits may have purchased long-term

credit risk assets that are illiquid. More specifically, some ABCP conduits

purchased residential mortgage loans made to borrowers with an impaired

credit history. As explained in chapter 29, mortgage loans to borrowers with

this credit characteristic are called "subprime mortgage loans." Mortgage

loans themselves are highly illiquid. Consequently, ABCP conduits funding

a pool of subprime mortgage loans may face difficulty in liquidating such

loans if funds are needed to redeem maturing ABCP and the conduit cannot

roll over its paper. This is indeed what happened in the financial crisis, as

discussed in the body of this chapter.

1. Federal Reserve Banks were directed to pay interest on required reserves and on excess reserves
by the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, which specified that the Fed amend

Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) to do so. The implementation of this

mandate was accelerated to October 2008 by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

2. The BBA selects the panel banks with assistance from the U.K. Foreign Exchange and Money
Markets Committee. For each currency, a panel consists of at least eight and a maximum of 16 banks
that are considered to be representative of participants in the London money market.

3. In 2013, the BBA discontinued LIBOR for five currencies: the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar,
New Zealand dollar, Swedish krona, and Danish krone.

4. To settle its role in the manipulation of LIBOR, Barclays in June 2012 agreed to pay a total of
\$453 million in fines to the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of
Justice, and the British Financial Services Authority. To settle its role in the LIBOR scandal, UBS
agreed in December 2012 to pay a record-setting fine of \$1.5 billion to authorities in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. For a summary of the lawsuits and potential lawsuits
arising from the manipulation of LIBOR, see C. Cowden W. Rayburn, "The LIBOR Scandal and

this chapter is on the bank loans, bonds, and medium-term notes.

Commercial paper was covered in chapter 25, and asset-backed securities

will be covered in chapter 27. At the end of this chapter, we discuss the

bankruptcy or insolvency laws as they relate to corporate creditors.

```
Bank Loans

```

As an alternative to the issuance of securities, a corporation can raise funds

by borrowing from a bank. [1] Until recently, in many countries, the dominant

form of corporate borrowing was bank loans, because corporate bond

markets were not yet well developed.

A corporation may use any of five sourcing alternatives: (1) a domestic

bank in the corporation's home country, (2) a subsidiary of a foreign bank

established in the corporation's home country, (3) a foreign bank domiciled

in a country where the corporation does business, (4) a subsidiary of a

domestic bank established in a country where the corporation does business,

- r (5) an offshore or Eurobank. Loans made by offshore banks are referred
to as **eurocurrency loans** . [2]

The market classifies bank loans to corporate borrowers into two

categories: investment-grade loans and leveraged loans. An **investment-**

**grade loan** is a bank loan made to corporate borrowers that have an

investment-grade rating. These loans are typically originated and held by

the originating bank in its portfolio, because these loans are revolving lines

- f credit. In such a loan arrangement, a bank sets a maximum amount that
can be borrowed by a corporation, and the corporation can take down any
part of that amount and repay it at any time. Because of the ability of the
corporate borrower to repay at any time and the absence of a maturity date
for the loan, an investment-grade bank loan is not sold by the originating
bank to institutional investors.

In contrast, a **leveraged loan** is a bank loan to a corporation that has a

below-investment-grade rating. A leveraged loan has a maturity and the

interest rate is floating, the reference rate being the LIBOR. In fact, when

market participants refer to corporate bank loans, they typically mean a

leveraged loan. These loans can be sold to institutional investors. In the

next section, we discuss a corporate bond issued by corporations with a

below-investment-grade rating called a "high-yield bond." A corporation

may have as its debt obligations both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds.

Later in this chapter, we discuss the difference between a leveraged loan

and a high-yield bond.

```
Syndicated Bank Loans

```

A **syndicated bank loan** is one in which a group (or syndicate) of banks

provides funds to the borrower. Roughly \$2.5 trillion of financing to U.S.

companies is provided by syndicated loans, with the size of a syndicated

loan ranging from \$20 million to more than \$2 billion. Consequently, the

need for a group of banks arises, because the amount sought by a borrower

might be too large for any one bank to be exposed to the borrower's credit

risk. Therefore, the syndicated bank loan is used by borrowers who seek to

raise a large amount of funds in the bank loan market rather than through

the issuance of securities.

The syndication may include using the securitization process to create

collateralized loan obligations, discussed in chapter 39, and is therefore an

important part of the corporate bank loan market. Another important

component of this market is loans that provide short-term or backstop

financing for corporations that are seeking funds until a more permanent

source of financing can be obtained. Such loans are referred to as **bridge**

**loans** if a loan is provided and **bridge loan commitments** if the agreement

is to provide a future loan. Together, bridge loans and bridge loan

commitments are referred to as .

**bridge loan facilities**

Syndicated bank loans are called **senior bank loan loans** because of

their priority position over subordinated lenders (bondholders) with respect

to repayment of interest and principal. The interest rate on a syndicated

bank loan is a rate that **floats**, which means that the loan rate is based on

some reference rate. The loan rate is periodically reset at the reference rate

plus a spread. The reference rate is typically LIBOR, although it could be

the prime rate (the rate that a bank charges its most creditworthy customers)

- r the rate on CDs. The term of the loan is fixed. A syndicated loan is
typically structured so that it is amortized according to a predetermined
schedule, and repayment of principal begins after a specified number of
years (typically not longer than five or six years). Structures in which no
repayment of the principal is made until the maturity date can be arranged
and are referred to as **bullet loans** .

A syndicated loan is arranged by either a bank or a securities house. The

arranger then lines up the syndicate. Each bank in the syndicate provides

the funds for which it has committed. The banks in the syndicate have the

right to sell their parts of the loan subsequently to other banks.

Syndicated loans are distributed by two methods: assignment or

participation. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, with the

method of assignment being the more desirable of the two. The holder of a

loan that is interested in selling a portion can do so by passing the interest in

the loan by the **method of assignment** . In this procedure, the seller

transfers all rights completely to the holder of the assignment, now called

the **assignee** . The assignee is said to have **privity of contract** with the

borrower. Because of the clear path between the borrower and assignee,

assignment is the more desirable choice of transfer and ownership. A

**participation** involves a holder of a loan "participating out" a portion of

the holding in that particular loan. The holder of the participation does not

become a party to the loan agreement and has a relationship not with the

borrower but with the seller of the participation. Unlike an assignment, a

participation does not confer privity of contract on the holder of the

participation, although the holder of the participation has the right to vote

- n certain legal matters concerning amendments to the loan agreement.
These matters include changes regarding maturity, interest rate, and issues
concerning the loan collateral. Because syndicated loans can be sold in this
manner, they are marketable.

In response to the large number of bank loans issued and their strong

credit protection, some commercial banks and securities houses are more

willing to commit capital and resources to facilitate trading as brokerdealers. Also, these senior bank loans can be securitized through the same

innovations discussed in chapter 27 for the securitization of loans and

discussed further in chapter 39. Further development of the senior bank

loan market will no doubt eventually erode the once-important distinction

between a security and a loan: A security has long been seen as a

marketable financial asset, whereas a loan has not been marketable.

Interestingly, the trading of these loans is not limited to **performing loans**,

which are loans whose borrowers are fulfilling contractual commitments. A

market also exists for trading nonperforming loans—loans on which the

borrowers have defaulted.

```
Secondary Market for Syndicated Bank Loans

```

Syndicated bank loans can be traded in the secondary market or securitized

to create collateralized loan obligations using the securitization technology

that is discussed in chapter 27. The trade association that has been the main

advocate of commercial loans as an asset class is the Loan Syndications and

Trading Association (LSTA). The LSTA has helped foster the development

- f a liquid and transparent secondary market for bank loans by establishing
market practices and settlement and operational procedures. The LSTA
collects quotations on U.S. loans on a daily basis.

In conjunction with Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary & Data

index, the LSTA has also developed a leveraged loan index to gauge the

performance of the different sectors of the syndicated loan market. The

S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan 100 Index is a weekly total return index.

```
Corporate Bonds

```

Corporate bonds are classified by the type of issuer. The four general

classifications are (1) public utilities, (2) transportation companies, (3)

banks/finance companies, and (4) industrial companies. [3] Finer breakdowns

are often made to create more homogeneous groupings. For example, public

utilities are subdivided into electric power companies, gas distribution

companies, water companies, and communications companies.

Transportation companies are divided further into airlines, railroads, and

trucking companies. Banks/finance companies include money center banks

and regional banks, savings and loan institutions, brokerage firms,

insurance companies, and finance companies. Industrial companies are the

catchall class and the most heterogeneous of the groups with respect to

investment characteristics. Industrial companies include manufacturers,

mining companies, merchandising companies, retailers, energy companies,

and companies in service-related industries.

```
Classification of the Global Corporate Bond Market

```

There is no uniform system for classifying the sectors of the global

corporate bond market. One possible classification is the one we used in

chapter 1 to describe the global financial market. There we said that from

the perspective of a given country, the global financial market can be

classified into two markets: an internal financial market and an external

financial market.

The internal financial market, also called the "national financial

market," can be broken into two parts: the domestic financial market and

the foreign financial market. The domestic financial market includes the

domestic corporate bond market. This market is where issuers domiciled in

the country issue bonds and where those bonds are subsequently traded.

The foreign financial market of a country includes the country's foreign

corporate bond market. This is the market where bonds of issuers not

domiciled in the country are issued and traded. For example, in the United

States, the foreign bond market is where bonds are issued by non-U.S.

entities and then subsequently traded. Bonds traded in the U.S. foreign bond

market are nicknamed "Yankee bonds." In Japan, a yen-denominated bond

issued by a British corporation and subsequently traded in Japan's bond

market is part of the Japanese foreign bond market. Yen-denominated bonds

issued by non-Japanese entities are nicknamed "samurai bonds." Foreign

bonds in the United Kingdom are referred to as "bulldog bonds," those in

the Netherlands are referred to as "Rembrandt bonds," and those in Spain

are called "matador bonds."

Regulatory authorities in the country where the bond is issued impose

certain rules governing their issuance. These may include the following:

  - restrictions on the bond structures that may be issued (e.g.,
unsecured debt, zero-coupon bonds, convertible bonds),

   - restrictions on the minimum or maximum size of an issue and/or the

frequency with which an issuer may come to market,

   - a waiting period before an issuer may bring the issue to market
(imposed to avoid an oversupply of issues),

   - a minimum quality standard (credit rating) for the issue or issuer,
   - disclosure and periodic reporting requirements, and
   - restrictions on the types of financial institutions permitted to
underwrite issues.

In the 1980s, governments generally relaxed or abolished these

restrictions to open up bond markets to issuers.

The **external corporate bond market**, also called the **international**

**corporate bond market**, is that part of a country's external financial

market that includes bonds with the following distinguishing features:

   - they are underwritten by an international syndicate;
   - at issuance, they are offered simultaneously to investors in more than
   - ne country;
   - they are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country; and
   - they are in unregistered form.

```
Basic Features of a Corporate Bond Issue

```

The essential features of a corporate bond issue are relatively simple. The

corporate issuer promises to pay a specified percentage of par value (known

as the coupon payment) on designated dates and to repay par or principal

value of the bond at maturity. In some countries, such as the United States,

interest payments are made semiannually; in other countries, the interest

payments are made annually. Failure to pay either principal or interest when

due constitutes legal default, and court proceedings can be instituted to

enforce the contract. Bondholders, as creditors, have a prior legal claim

- ver common and preferred stockholders with regard to both income and
assets of the corporation for the principal and interest due them.

The promises of corporate bond issuers and the rights of investors who

buy their bonds are set forth in great detail in contracts called **bond**

**indentures** . The covenants or restrictions on management are important in

the analysis of the credit risk of a corporate bond issue. To determine at a

particular time whether the corporate issuer is meeting its obligations, a

third party to the contract is used: a corporate trustee. A corporate trustee is

a bond or trust company with a corporate trust department and officers who

are experts in performing the functions of a trustee. The indenture is made

- ut to the corporate trustee as a representative of the interests of
bondholders; that is, the trustee acts in a fiduciary capacity for investors
who own the bond issue.

A bond's indenture clearly outlines three important aspects: its maturity,

its security, and its provisions for retirement.

**`Maturity of bonds`** Most corporate bonds are **term bonds** ; that is, they
run for a term of years and then become due and payable. Term bonds are

- ften referred to as having **bullet maturity**, or simply, **bullet bonds** . Any
amount of the liability not paid off prior to maturity must be paid off at that
time. The bond's term may be long or short. Generally, obligations due less
than 10 years from the date of issue are called **notes** . [4]

Most corporate borrowings take the form of bonds due in 20 to 30 years.

Term bonds may be retired by payment at final maturity or retired prior to

maturity if provided for in the indenture. Some corporate bond issues are so

arranged that specified principal amounts become due on specified dates

prior to maturity. Such issues are called "serial bonds." Equipment trust

certificates (discussed later) are structured as serial bonds.

**`Security for bonds`** Either real property (using a mortgage) or personal
property may be pledged to offer security beyond that of the general credit
standing of the issuer. A **mortgage bond** grants the bondholders a lien
against the pledged assets. A **lien** is a legal right to sell mortgaged property
to satisfy unpaid obligations to bondholders. In practice, the foreclosure and
sale of mortgaged property are unusual. If a default occurs, usually a
financial reorganization of the issuer makes the provision for settlement of
the debt to bondholders. However, the mortgage lien is important, because
it gives the mortgage bondholders a strong bargaining position relative to

- ther creditors when determining the terms of a reorganization in a
bankruptcy. (We discuss reorganization later in this chapter.)

Some companies do not own fixed assets or other real property, and so

they have nothing on which they can give a mortgage lien to secure

bondholders. Instead, these firms own securities of other companies and

thus are holding companies. The firms whose shares are owned are

subsidiaries. To satisfy the desire of bondholders for security, the holding

companies pledge stocks, notes, bonds, or whatever other kind of financial

instruments they own. These assets are termed "collateral" (or "personal

property"), and bonds secured by such assets are called "collateral trust

bonds."

Many years ago, the railway companies developed a way of financing

the purchase of cars and locomotives (i.e., rolling stock) that enabled them

to borrow at just about the lowest rates in the corporate bond market.

Railway rolling stock was for a long time regarded by investors as excellent

security for debt. The equipment is sufficiently standardized that it can be

used by one railway as well as another. And, of course, it can be readily

moved from the tracks of one railroad to those of another. Therefore,

generally a good market exists for the lease or sale of cars and locomotives.

The railroads take advantage of these characteristics of rolling stock by

developing a legal arrangement for giving investors a legal claim on it that

is different from, and generally superior to, a mortgage lien.

In this situation, the legal arrangement vests legal title to railway

equipment in a trustee. When a railway company orders some cars and

locomotives from a manufacturer, the manufacturer transfers legal title to

the equipment to that trustee. The trustee in turn leases the equipment to the

railroad, and at the same time sells equipment trust certificates to obtain the

funds to pay the manufacturer. The trustee collects lease payments from the

railroad and uses these receipts to pay interest and principal on the

certificates. The principal is therefore paid off on specified dates, a

provision that distinguishes a certificate from a term bond.

The general idea of the equipment trust arrangement is also used by

companies engaged in providing other kinds of transportation. For example,

trucking companies finance the purchase of huge fleets of trucks in the

same manner; airlines use this kind of financing to purchase planes; and

international oil companies use it to buy huge tankers.

A **debenture bond** is not secured by a specific pledge of property,

which does not mean that this type of bond has no claim on the property of

issuers or on their earnings. Debenture bondholders hold the claim of

general creditors on all assets of the issuer not pledged specifically to

secure other debt. Also, holders of debentures can claim pledged assets to

the extent that these assets have value greater than that necessary to satisfy

secured creditors. A **subordinated debenture bond** is an issue that ranks

after secured debt, after debenture bonds, and often after some general

creditors in its claim on assets and earnings.

The type of corporate security issued determines the cost to the issuer.

For a given corporation, mortgage bonds will cost less than debenture

bonds, and debenture bonds will cost less than subordinated debenture

bonds. A **guaranteed bond** is an obligation guaranteed by another entity.

The safety of a guaranteed bond depends on the financial capability of the

guarantor to satisfy the terms of the guarantee, as well as on the financial

capability of the issuer. The terms of the guarantee may call for the

guarantor to guarantee the payment of interest and/or repayment of the

principal.

Note that a superior legal status will not prevent bondholders from

suffering financial loss when the issuer's ability to generate cash flow

adequate to pay its obligations is seriously eroded.

**`Provisions for paying off bonds`** Most corporate issues contain a call
provision allowing the issuer the option to buy back all or part of the issue
prior to maturity. Some issues carry a **sinking fund** provision, which
specifies that the issuer must retire a predetermined amount of the issue
periodically.

When negotiating the terms of a new bond issue, an important question

is whether the issuer has the right to redeem the _entire amount_ - f bonds

- utstanding on a date before maturity. Issuers generally want this right,
because they recognize that at some time in the future, the general level of
interest rates may fall sufficiently below the issue's coupon rate that
redeeming the issue and replacing it with another issue carrying a lower
coupon rate would be attractive. For reasons discussed later in this chapter,
this right represents a disadvantage to the bondholder.

The usual practice is a provision that denies the issuer the right to

redeem bonds during the first 5 to 10 years following the date of issue with

proceeds received from the sale of lower-cost debt obligations that have an

equal or superior rank to the debt to be redeemed. This type of redemption

is called **refunding** . Even though most long-term issues carry these

refunding restrictions, they may be immediately callable, in whole or in

part, if the source of funds is something other than money raised with debt

that carries a lower interest cost. Under such a provision, acceptable sources

include cash flow from operations, proceeds from a common stock sale, or

funds from the sale of property.

Investors often confuse refunding protection with call protection. Call

protection is much more comprehensive, because it prohibits the early

redemption of the bond _for any reason_ . In contrast, refunding restrictions

provide protection only against the one type of redemption already

mentioned. As a rule, corporate bonds are callable at a premium above par.

Generally, the amount of the premium declines as the bond approaches

maturity and often reaches zero after some number of years following

issuance. The initial amount of the premium may be as much as one year's

coupon interest or as little as the coupon interest for half of a year.

If the issuer has the choice to retire all or part of an issue prior to

maturity, the buyer of the bond takes the chance that the issue will be called

**call risk**                                 - r
away at a disadvantageous time. This risk is referred to as
**timing risk** . Call provisions present two disadvantages from the investor's
perspective. First, as explained in chapter 11, a decline in interest rates in
the economy increases the price of a debt instrument, although in the case

- f a callable bond, the price increase is somewhat limited. If and when
interest rates decline far enough below the coupon rate to make a call an
immediate or prospective danger, the market value of the callable bond will
not rise as much as that of noncallable issues that are similar in all other

respects. Second, when a bond issue is called as a result of a decline in

interest rates, the investor must reinvest the proceeds received at a lower

interest rate (unless the investor chooses debt of greater risk).

Corporate bond indentures may require the issuer to retire a specified

portion of an issue each year. This sinking fund provision for the repayment

- f the debt may be designed to liquidate all of a bond issue by the maturity
date, or it may call for the liquidation of only a part of the total by the end

- f the term. If only a part of the outstanding bond is paid before retirement,
the remainder is called a **balloon maturity** . The purpose of the sinking fund
provision is to reduce credit risk. Generally, the issuer may satisfy the
sinking fund requirement by either (1) making a cash payment of the face
amount of the bonds to be retired to the corporate trustee, which then calls
the bonds for redemption using a lottery, or (2) delivering to the trustee
bonds with a total face value equal to the amount that must be retired from
bonds purchased in the open market.

```
Bond Features

```

Here we look at the different type of bond features that have been used by

corporations throughout the world. We discuss unique structures for issuers

- f high-yield corporate bonds later.

**`Convertible and exchangeable bonds`** The conversion provision in a
corporate bond issue grants the bondholder the right to convert the bond to
a predetermined number of shares of common stock of the issuer. A
**convertible bond** is therefore a corporate bond with a call option to buy the
common stock of the issuer. An **exchangeable bond** grants the bondholder
the right to exchange the bond for the common stock of a firm other than

the issuer of the bond. For example, Ford Motor Credit exchangeable bonds

are exchangeable for the common stock of its parent company, Ford Motor

Company.

**`Issues of debt with warrants`** Warrants may be attached as a part of a
bond issue. A **warrant** grants the holder the right to purchase a designated
security at a specified price from the issuer of the bond. A warrant is simply
a call option. It may permit the holder to purchase the common stock of the
issuer of the debt or the common stock of a firm other than the issuer's. Or

the warrant may grant the holder the right to purchase a debt obligation of

the issuer. Generally, warrants can be detached from the bond and sold

separately. Typically, when exercising the warrant, an investor may choose

either to pay cash or to offer the debt (valued at par) that was part of the

- ffering. A major difference between warrants and convertible or
exchangeable bonds is that an investor exercising the option provided by
the latter must turn the bond in to the issuer.

**`Putable bonds`** A putable bond grants the bondholder the right to sell the
issue back to the issuer at par value on designated dates. The advantage to
the bondholder is that if interest rates rise after the issue date, thereby
reducing the market value of the bond, the bondholder can sell the bond
back to the issuer for par.

**`Zero-coupon bonds`** Zero-coupon bonds are, just as the name implies,
bonds without coupon payments or a stated interest rate. In the Treasury
market, the U.S. government does not issue zero-coupon bonds. Dealers
strip issues and create these bonds from the cash flow of a coupon Treasury
bond. Corporations, however, can and do issue zero-coupon bonds. The first
such public offering was in the spring of 1981. From the investor's
perspective, the attractiveness of a zero-coupon bond is that the investor
who holds the bond to the maturity date will realize a predetermined return

- n the bond, unlike a coupon bond, where the actual return realized, if the
bond is held to maturity, depends on the rate at which coupon payments can
be reinvested.

**`Floating-rate`** **`securities`** The coupon interest on floating-rate
securities is reset periodically to follow changes in the level of some
predetermined benchmark rate. For example, the coupon rate may be reset
every six months to a rate equal to a spread of 100 basis points over the sixmonth Treasury bill rate.

Floating-rate securities are attractive to some institutional investors,

because they allow the purchase of an asset with an income stream that

closely matches the floating nature of the income of specific liabilities.

Certain floating-rate instruments are viewed by some investors as a passive

substitute for short-term investments, particularly that part of a short-term

portfolio that is more or less consistently maintained at certain minimum

levels. Thus, floating-rate securities save on the costs of constantly rolling

- ver short-term securities as they reach maturity.

Why do corporations issue floating-rate securities? Closer matching of

their income flows from variable-rate assets with floating-rate liabilities is

- f major importance, especially with such lenders as banks, thrifts, and
finance companies. Issuers can fix or lock in a spread between the cost of
borrowed funds and the rate at which those funds are loaned out. Another

reason might be to avoid uncertainties associated with what could be an

unreceptive market at some future date. The issuer can tap a new source for

intermediateto long-term funds at short-term rates, thereby making fewer

**.**
trips to the marketplace and avoiding related issuance costs

Also, in the presence of inflation, a floating-rate security (rolled over, if

needed) may have a lower interest cost than a fixed-rate, long-term security.

The reason is that, with inflation, the long rate may incorporate a substantial

premium against the uncertainty of future inflation and interest rates.

Finally, as noted in our discussion of interest rate swaps in chapter 37, an

issuer may find that it can issue a floating-rate security and convert

payments into a fixed-rate stream through an interest rate swap agreement.

An issuer will elect this approach if the cost of issuing a floating-rate

security and then using an interest rate swap results in a lower cost than

simply issuing a fixed-rate security.

Other features may be included in a floating-rate issue. For example,

many floating-rate issues include a put option. Some issues are

exchangeable either automatically at a certain date (often five years after

issuance) or at the option of the issuer into fixed-rate securities. A few

issues are convertible into the common stock of the issuer. Many floatingrate issues have a ceiling or maximum interest rate for the coupon rate;

some have a floor or minimum interest rate for the coupon rate.

**`Inflation-indexed bonds  Corporate inflation-indexed bonds`** have
interest or principal linked to a nationally recognized inflation measure,
such as the U.S. consumer price index (U.S. CPI) in the United States, the
Eurozone's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (excluding tobacco), the
U.K.'s Retail Price Index, and France's CPI (excluding tobacco). As
explained in chapter 20, these issues are referred to as "Treasury inflation
protected securities," or TIPS. Outside the United States, bond coupon rates
are linked to the rate of inflation and are referred to as **linkers** .

**`Dual-currency bonds`** Some issues pay coupon interest in one currency
and the principal in a different currency. Such issues are called **dual-**
**currency issues** . For the first type of dual-currency bond, the exchange rate
that is used to convert the principal and coupon payments into a specific
currency is specified at the time the bond is issued. The second type differs
from the first in that the applicable exchange rate is the rate that prevails at
the time a cash flow is made (i.e., at the spot exchange rate at the time a
payment is made). A third type offers to either the investor or the issuer the
choice of currency. These bonds are commonly referred to as **option**

.

**currency bonds**

```
Adjusting Yields for Different Interest Payment Frequencies

```

For a bond that pays coupon interest, the frequency with which the issuer

makes interest payments varies by country. Although yield measures, such

as the yield to maturity, are not very useful for assessing the potential return

from investing in a bond, market convention is used for calculating yield.

Let's begin with the traditional convention for calculating yield to

maturity. In that convention, the benchmark is computing the yield on a

bond that pays interest semiannually. The yield to maturity measure is

calculated by first determining the interest rate that makes the present value

- f the semiannual cash flow equal to the price, and then doubles that
interest rate. As explained in chapter 16, the yield to maturity calculated in
this manner is called the bond-equivalent yield (BEY).

The frequency of corporate bond interest payments can be semiannual or

annual payments. Different countries follow a practice of issuing one or the

- ther. In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and
Australia, for example, the frequency of payment of corporate bonds is
semiannually. In the Eurobond market and many European countries, the
practice is to make coupon interest payments annually. To compare an
annual-pay bond to a semiannual-pay bond on BEY basis, the following
formula is used:

BEY of an annual-pay bond = 2[(1 + Yield to maturity on an annual pay

bond) [1/2]  - 1].

This formula computes the semiannual yield for the annual-pay bond and

then doubles it. Recall the convention used in calculating the BEY for a

semiannual-paying bond. For example, suppose that the yield to maturity of

an annual-pay bond is 6%. Then its BEY is

2[(1 + 0.06) [1/2] - 1] = 0.0591 = 5.91%.

Notice that the BEY will always be less than the annual-pay bond's yield to

maturity.

To convert the BEY of a semiannual-pay basis so that it can be

compared to the yield to maturity of an annual-pay bond, the following

formula can be used:

Yield to maturity on annual-pay basis = [1 + (Yield to maturity on a BEY

basis/2)] [2]  - 1.

For example, suppose that the yield to maturity of a semiannual-pay bond is

quoted on a BEY basis is 5.5%.The yield to maturity on an annual-pay basis

would then be

[(1 + 0.055/2) [2] ] − 1 = 0.0558 = 5.58%.

The yield to maturity on an annual-pay basis is always greater than the yield

to maturity on a BEY basis.

```
High-Yield Sector

```

As already noted, high-yield bonds are issues with a credit rating below

triple B. Bond issues in this sector of the market may have been rated

investment grade at the time of issuance and have been downgraded

subsequently to noninvestment grade, or they may have been rated

noninvestment grade at the time of issuance, called **original-issue, high-**

.

**yield bonds**

Downgraded bonds fall into two groups: (1) issues downgraded because

the issuer voluntarily significantly increased its debt as a result of a

leveraged buyout or a recapitalization, and (2) issues downgraded for other

.

reasons. The latter issues are commonly referred to as **fallen angels**

**`Role of high-yield bonds in financial markets`** The introduction of

- riginal-issue, high-yield bonds proved to be an important financial
innovation with wide impact throughout the financial system. A common
view held that high-default-risk bonds would not be attractive to the
investing public, at least at interest rates that would be acceptable to the
borrower. The view rested on the skewed nature of the outcomes offered by
the instrument: The maximum return that an investor can obtain is capped
by the coupon and face value, but the loss could be as large as the principal
invested. It was the merit of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and particularly of
Michael Milken of that firm, to disprove that view, as evidenced by the
explosive growth of this market.

Before the development of the high-yield market, U.S. corporations that

could not issue securities in the public debt market would borrow from

commercial banks or finance companies on a shortto intermediate-term

basis or would be shut off from credit. With the advent of the high-yield

bond structure, financing shifted from commercial banks to the public

market.

In essence, the high-yield bond market shifts the risk from commercial

banks to the investing public in general. Several advantages occur with such

a shift. First, when commercial banks lend to high-credit-risk borrowers,

that risk is accepted indirectly by all U.S. citizens, who may not wish to

accept the risk. The reason is that the commercial bank liabilities are backed

by the FDIC and so carry the guarantee of the U.S. government. If highcredit-risk corporations default on their loans, causing an FDIC bailout, all

taxpayers eventually may have to pay. The liabilities of other investors

(excluding thrifts that have invested in high-yield bonds) are not backed by

the U.S. government (and, therefore, not by U.S. citizens). The risks of this

investing are taken by the specific investor group willing to accept them.

The second advantage is that commercial bank loans are typically shortterm, floating-rate loans, which make debt financing less attractive to

corporations. High-yield bond issues give corporations the opportunity to

issue long-term, fixed-rate debt. Third, commercial banks set interest rates

based on their credit analysis. When high-yield bonds are traded in a public

market, the investing public establishes the interest rate. Finally, the highyield market opens up the possibility of funding for some firms that

previously had no means to obtain it.

Corporate bond issuers use the proceeds from a bond sale for various

purposes, including working capital, expansion of facilities, refinancing of

- utstanding debt, and financing takeovers (mergers and acquisitions). In the
case of noninvestment-grade bonds, it is the use of the proceeds to finance
takeovers (particularly hostile takeovers) that aroused public concern over
the excessive use of debt by U.S. corporations. [5]

**`High-yield bond structures`** In the early years of the high-yield market,
all issues followed a conventional structure: The issues paid a fixed coupon
rate and were term bonds. Today, however, more complex bond structures

- ccupy the junk bond space, particularly for bonds issued for leveraged
buyout (LBO) financing and recapitalizations producing higher debt.

In an LBO or a recapitalization, the heavy interest payment burden that

the corporation assumes places severe cash flow constraints on the firm. To

reduce this burden, firms involved in LBOs and recapitalizations issue

bonds with deferred coupon structures that permit the issuer to avoid using

cash to make interest payments for a period of three to seven years.

Deferred coupon structures include (1) deferred-interest bonds, (2) step-up

bonds, and (3) payment-in-kind bonds.

**Deferred-interest bonds** are the most common type of deferred coupon
structure. These bonds sell at a deep discount and do not pay interest for an
initial period, typically for three to seven years. (Because no interest is paid
for an initial period, these bonds are sometimes referred to as "zerocoupon" bonds.) **Step-up bonds** do pay coupon interest, but the coupon rate
is low for an initial period and then increases ("steps up") to a higher
coupon rate. Finally, **payment-in-kind bonds** give the issuer an option to
pay cash at a coupon payment date or give the bondholder a similar bond
(i.e., a bond with the same coupon rate and a par value equal to the amount

- f the coupon payment that would have been paid). The period during
which the issuer can make this choice varies from 5 to 10 years.

As explained earlier in this chapter, **leveraged loans** are bank loans in

which the borrower is a noninvestment-grade borrower. Hence, leveraged

loans and high-yield bonds are alternative sources of debt for

noninvestment-grade borrowers. Here we summarize the distinguishing

characteristics of these sources of debt funding.

The coupon rate on high-yield bonds is typically a fixed interest rate.

For leveraged loans, it is a floating rate, with the most common reference

rate being the three-month LIBOR. High-yield bonds usually have a

maturity of 10 years and are noncallable until three or five years after

issuance. Leveraged loans are shorter term, usually five to eight years, and

- ffer no call protection: They are callable at any time.

In the capital structure, leveraged loans are the most senior bonds, and

high-yield bonds are subordinated to bank loans. With respect to covenants,

they are stronger for leveraged loans than for high-yield bonds, which is

- ne of the reasons corporate borrowers prefer to issue bonds. Finally, as we
explain below, investors are concerned with the amount that can be
recovered in the case of a default. Historically, the average recovery rate for
defaulted leveraged loans is much higher than that for defaulted high-yield
bonds.

**`Corporate bond defaults and recovery rates`** A good deal of
published research has investigated corporate bond default rates. [6] Various
methodologies are used by CRAs and researchers to measure corporate

bond default rates. As expected, all studies indicate that historically, there

was a higher percentage of defaults as the credit rating declines. For

example, Moody's reports that for 1982 to 2010, virtually no defaults

- occurred for corporate bonds rated in its top three rating categories (Aaa,
Aa1, and Aa2). In contrast, for Moody's Ca-rated corporate bonds, the
default rate was about 33%. Looking at default rates for investment-grade
and speculative-grade bonds, the average Moody's default rate for the
former was less than 1%, whereas for the latter it was 4.8%. [7]

To evaluate the performance of the corporate bond sector, more than just

default rates are needed. The reason is that default rates by themselves are

not of paramount significance: It is perfectly possible for a portfolio of

corporate bonds to suffer defaults and to outperform Treasuries at the same

time, provided the yield spread of the portfolio is sufficiently high to offset

the losses from defaults. Furthermore, because holders of defaulted bonds

typically recover a percentage of the face amount of their investment, this is

called the **recovery rate** . Therefore, an important measure for studying the

performance of the corporate bond sector is the **default loss rate**, which is

defined as follows:

Default loss rate = Default rate × (100% − Recovery rate).

For instance, a default rate of 5% and a recovery rate of 30% means a

default loss rate of 3.5% (5% × 70%). Therefore, focusing exclusively on

default rates merely highlights the worst possible outcome that a diversified

portfolio of corporate bonds would suffer, assuming all defaulted bonds

would be totally worthless.

As with default rates, different methodologies have been used to

compute recovery rates. The annual average recovery rate on defaulted

bank loans from 1982 to 2010 as reported by Moody's was 65.8% for firstlien bank loans, 29.1% for second-lien bank loans, and 47.8% for third-lien

bank loans. For bonds, the average annual recovery rate by the bond's lien

position ranged from 50.8% for senior secured bonds to 24.7% for junior

subordinated bonds. [8]

```
Corporate Issuance in the Eurobond Market

```

The Eurobond market is divided into sectors depending on the currency in

which the issue is denominated. For example, when Eurobonds are

**Eurodollar bonds** .
denominated in U.S. dollars, they are referred to as

.

Eurobonds denominated in Japanese yen are referred to as **Euroyen bonds**

It has become increasingly difficult to classify a bond issue as a foreign

bond or a Eurobond based on the distinguishing characteristics cited earlier.

It is common to refer to a corporate bond as a "Eurobond offering" if it has

- nly one underwriter and its issue is placed primarily outside the national
market of both the issuer and the underwriter. Another characteristic of a

Eurobond is that it is not regulated by the single country whose currency is

used to pay bondholders. In practice, however, only the United States and

Canada do not place restrictions on U.S. dollar-denominated or Canadian

dollar-denominated issues sold outside the two countries. Regulators of

- ther countries whose currencies are used in Eurobond issues have closely
supervised such offerings. Their power to regulate Eurobond offerings
comes from their ability to impose foreign exchange or capital restrictions.

Although Eurobonds are typically registered on a national stock

exchange (the most common being the Luxembourg, London, or Zurich

exchanges), the bulk of all trading is in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.

Listing is purely to circumvent restrictions imposed on some institutional

investors who are prohibited from purchasing securities that are not listed

- n an exchange. Some of the stronger issuers privately place issues with
international institutional investors.

```
Asian Corporate Bond Market

```

The principal market for raising capital in the debt market in Asian

countries has been via traditional bank borrowing. Following the global

financial crisis, however, corporations have made greater use of the bond

market to diversify their funding sources. Measured in terms of the amount

- f corporate bonds outstanding relative to the size (in terms of GDP) of a
country's economy, five countries have outstanding bonds exceeding 50%

- f GDP and are viewed as having advanced bond markets: Hong Kong,
Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan. [9] China, India, Indonesia,
and Thailand are countries in the early stages of development of their

corporate bond market, but there are signs that these markets will grow

rapidly. For example, China doubled the share of corporate bonds

- utstanding relative to GDP in 2009–2013, making it the largest regional
corporate bond market in terms of U.S. dollars.

The Asian corporate bond market is divided into two sectors, based on

whether the currency of denomination of the issue is a foreign currency or

the local currency. Corporate bonds denominated in a foreign currency are

referred to as the **regional corporate bonds**, whereas corporate bonds

denominated in the country's own currency are referred to as **local**

**currency bonds** . The foreign currency for most regional corporate bonds is

the U.S. dollar. The corporate issuers in this market are global and top-tier

local corporate entities. Approximately 83% of Asian non-financial

corporate bonds markets are denominated in their local currencies. [10]

```
The Secondary Corporate Bond Market and Its Regulation

```

As with all bonds, the principal secondary market for corporate bonds is the

OTC market. The major concern is market transparency.

In the United States, the reporting system and compliance vehicle of the

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the **Trade Reporting**

**and Compliance Engine** (TRACE), requires that all broker-dealers who

are members of FINRA must, under a set of rules approved by the SEC,

report transactions in corporate bonds (investment grade, high yield, and

convertible bonds) to TRACE. At the end of each trading day, market

aggregate statistics are published on corporate bond market activity. The

end-of-day recap information provided includes (1) the number of securities

and total par amount traded; (2) advances, declines, and 52-week highs and

lows; and (3) the 10 most active investment-grade, high-yield, and

convertible bonds for the day.

The European Union has passed various legal acts dealing with financial

markets. The legal acts are in the form of what the European Union refers to

as "regulations" and "directives." [11] There are EU regulations and directives

- n various aspects of the financial markets. These legal acts deal with wideranging issues and attempt to create a single European financial market that
provides greater protection for investors, improved conduct by market

participants, stability for the financial system, and market transparency. The

key regulations for providing transparency in the secondary bond market

(including securitized products) are part of the Markets in Financial

Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), Level 1 adopted in April 2014 by the

EU Parliament The rules are now applied to bonds and derivatives, whereas

the MiFID, referred to as MiFID I, set rules only for equities.

MiFID II introduces a market structure framework that ensures that

trading, wherever appropriate, takes place on regulated platforms. The

regulation calls for the reporting of post-trade information in as close to real

time as possible. Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation allows

waivers to the reporting requirements based on certain factors, with the

specific rules regarding waivers (as well as delayed reporting) left to the

European Securities and Markets Authority to formulate. Improved

transparency was established by rules to enhance the effective consolidation

and disclosure of trading data. These rules oblige trading venues to make

available to market participants preand post-trade data at a reasonable cost

and to do so by establishing a consolidated tape mechanism for post-trade

data.

**`Electronic bond trading`** Traditionally, corporate bond trading has been
an OTC market conducted by telephone and based on broker-dealer trading
desks that take principal positions in corporate bonds to fulfill the buy and
sell orders of their customers. There has been a transition away from this
traditional form of bond trading and toward electronic trading.

Electronic bond trading makes up about 30% of corporate bond trading.

The major advantages of electronic trading over traditional corporate bond

trading in the OTC market are (1) the ability to provide liquidity to the

markets, (2) enhanced price discovery (particularly for less liquid markets),

(3) the use of new technologies, and (4) trading and portfolio management

efficiencies. As an example of the advantage, a portfolio manager can load

buy and sell orders on a website, trade from these orders, and then clear the

- rders.

There are five types of electronic corporate bond trading systems.

**Auction systems** allow participants with a low market share to conduct

electronic auctions of securities offerings for both new issues in the primary

market and secondary market offerings. Auction systems are not typically

used. **Cross-matching systems** bring dealers and institutional investors

together in electronic trading networks that provide real-time or periodic

cross-matching sessions. Buy and sell orders are executed automatically

when matched. **Interdealer systems** allow dealers to execute transactions

electronically with other dealers through the anonymous services of

"brokers' brokers." The clients of dealers are not involved in interdealer

systems. **Multidealer systems** allow customers with consolidated orders

from two or more dealers to execute from among multiple quotes.

Multidealer systems, also called **client-to-dealer systems**, typically display

to customers the best bid or offer price of those posted by all dealers. The

participating dealer usually acts as the principal in the transaction. **Single-**

**dealer systems** permit investors to execute transactions directly with the

specific dealer desired; this dealer acts as a principal in the transaction, with

investor access to the dealer, which increasingly has been through the

Internet. Thus, single-dealer systems simply replace telephone contact

between a single dealer and a customer with Internet contact.

```
Medium-Term Notes

```

A **medium-term note (MTN)** is a corporate debt instrument with the

unique characteristic that such notes are offered continuously to investors

by an agent of the issuer. Investors can select from several maturity ranges:

nine months to one year, more than one year to 18 months, more than 18

months to two years, and so on, up to 30 years. MTNs are registered with

the SEC under Rule 415 (the shelf registration rule), which gives a

corporation maximum flexibility for issuing securities on a continuous

basis.

The term "medium-term note" to describe this corporate debt instrument

is misleading. Traditionally, the term "note" or "medium term" was used to

refer to debt issues with a maturity greater than one year but less than 15

years. Certainly, this characteristic is stretched for MTNs, because they

have been sold with maturities from nine months to 30 years, and even

longer. For example, in July 1993, Walt Disney Corporation issued a

security with a 100-year maturity off its medium-term note shelf

registration.

In 1982, Rule 415 was adopted, making it easier for issuers to sell

registered securities on a continuous basis.

Borrowers have flexibility when designing MTNs to satisfy their own

needs. They can issue fixedor floating-rate debt. The coupon payments

can be denominated in U.S dollars or in a foreign currency.

When the treasurer of a corporation contemplates an offering of either

MTNs or corporate bonds, two factors affect the decision. The most

- bvious is the cost of the funds raised after consideration of registration and
distribution costs. This cost is referred to as the **all-in-cost of funds** . The

second is the flexibility afforded to the issuer in structuring the offering.

The growth in the MTN market is evidence of the relative advantage of

MTNs with respect to cost and flexibility for some offerings. However,

some corporations raise funds by issuing both bonds and MTNs, which

would indicate that no absolute advantage can be gained in all instances and

market environments.

MTNs are rated by credit rating agencies. About 99% of all MTNs

issued receive an investment-grade rating at the time of issuance.

```
The Primary Market

```

MTNs differ from corporate bonds in the way that they are distributed to

investors when initially sold. Although some investment-grade corporate

bond issues are sold on a best-efforts basis, typically they are underwritten

by investment bankers. The traditional method of distribution for MTNs is

- n a best-efforts basis by either an investment banking firm or other brokerdealers acting as agents. Another difference between corporate bonds and
MTNs when they are offered is that MTNs are usually sold in relatively
small amounts on a continuous or an intermittent basis, whereas corporate
bonds are sold in large, discrete offerings.

In the United States, a corporation that wants an MTN program will file

a shelf registration with the SEC for the offering of securities. The SEC

registration for MTN offerings is between \$100 and \$1 billion, but once the

total is sold, the issuer can file another shelf registration. The registration

includes a list of the investment banking firms, usually two to four, that the

corporation has engaged to act as agents to distribute the MTNs. The large

New York-based investment banking firms dominate the distribution market

for MTNs.

The issuer then posts rates over a range of maturities: for example, nine

months to one year, one year to 18 months, 18 months to two years, and

annually thereafter. Usually, an issuer will post rates as a spread over a

Treasury security of comparable maturity. The rate offering schedule can be

changed at any time by the issuer either in response to changing market

conditions or because the issuer has raised the desired amount of funds at a

given maturity. In the latter case, the issuer can either not post a rate for that

maturity range or lower the rate. The agents then make the offering rate

schedule available to their investor base interested in MTNs. An investor

interested in the offering contacts the agent. In turn, the agent contacts the

issuer to confirm the terms of the transaction. Because the maturity range in

the offering rate schedule does not specify a specific maturity date, the

investor can choose the final maturity subject to approval by the issuer. The

minimum size an investor can purchase of an MTN offering typically

ranges from \$1 million to \$25 million.

```
Structured MTNs

```

It is common today for issuers of MTNs to couple their offerings with

transactions in the derivative markets (options, futures/forward contracts,

swaps, caps, and floors) so as to create debt obligations with more

interesting risk/return features than are available in the corporate bond

market. Specifically, an issue may have a floating rate over all or part of the

life of the security, and the coupon reset formula may be based on a

benchmark interest rate, equity index or individual stock price, a foreign

exchange rate, or a commodity index.

Some MTNs even offer coupon reset formulas that vary inversely with a

benchmark interest rate; that is, if the benchmark interest rate increases

(decreases), the coupon rate decreases (increases). Debt instruments with

.

this coupon characteristic are called **inverse floating-rate securities**

MTNs created when the issuer simultaneously transacts in the derivative

markets are called **structured notes** . The most common derivative

instrument used when creating structured notes is a swap—a derivative

instrument that we discussed in chapter 37. The motivation for issuing a

structured note is that investors are willing to pay a premium for such

securities and, as a result, the issuer will realize a lower funding cost than

by just issuing a standard MTN or corporate bond.

```
Lease Financing

```

The market for lease financing is a segment of the larger market for

equipment financing. Any type of equipment that can be purchased with

borrowed funds can also be leased. Our interest here is in the leasing of

equipment that can be classified as a big-ticket item (i.e., equipment costing

more than \$5 million). Included in this group are commercial aircraft, large

ships, large quantities of production equipment, and energy facilities. A

special type of leasing arrangement, known as a leveraged lease, is used

when financing such equipment.

Leasing works as follows. The potential equipment user, called the

**lessee**, first selects the equipment and the dealer or manufacturer from

which the equipment will be purchased. The lessee negotiates such aspects

- f the transaction as the purchase price, specifications, warranties, and
delivery date. When the lessee accepts the terms of the deal, another party,
such as a bank or finance company, buys the equipment from the dealer or
manufacturer and leases it to the lessee. This party is called the **lessor** . The
lease is so arranged that the lessor realizes the tax benefits associated with
the ownership of the leased equipment.

Basically, leasing is a vehicle by which tax benefits can be transferred

from the user of the equipment (the lessee), which may not have the

capacity to take advantage of the tax benefits associated with equipment

- wnership (e.g., depreciation and any tax credits), to another entity that can
utilize them (the lessor). In exchange for these tax benefits, a lessor
provides lower-cost financing to the lessee than the lessee could get by
purchasing the equipment with borrowed funds. Such leases are referred to

as **tax-oriented leases** .

The two ways in which a lessor can finance the purchase of the

equipment are, first, to provide all the financing from its own funds and

therefore be at risk for 100% of the funds used to purchase the equipment.

Such leasing arrangements are referred to as **single-investor** - r **direct**

**leases** . Essentially, such leases are two-party agreements (between the

lessee and the lessor). The second way is for the lessor to use only a portion

- f its own funds to purchase the equipment and to borrow the balance from
a bank or group of banks. This type of leasing arrangement is called a
**leveraged lease** . The three parties to a leveraged lease agreement are the
lessee, the lessor, and the lender. The leveraged lease arrangement allows
the lessor to realize all the tax benefits from owning the equipment and the
tax benefits from borrowing funds—deductible interest payments—while
putting up only a portion of its own funds to purchase the equipment.
Therefore, leveraged leasing is commonly used in financing big-ticket
items.

In a leveraged lease transaction, it is necessary for a party to arrange for

the equity and the debt portions of the funding involved. The same party

can arrange both. The equity portion is typically provided by one or more

institutional investors. The debt portion is arranged with a bank. Because

leveraged lease transactions are for large-ticket items, the bank debt is

typically arranged as a syndicated bank loan. For example, the financing of

aircraft is normally accomplished through leveraged lease financing.

```
Insolvency Laws

```

Every country has its own insolvency laws or bankruptcy laws for dealing

with corporations having financial difficulties paying off their creditors and

the treatment of corporate creditors. We first review the general issues

covered by the bankruptcy laws in all countries. However, we cannot

provide a description of every country's insolvency laws. Because many

countries base their bankruptcy procedures on the U.S. bankruptcy system,

we will review this system.

```
Issues Covered by Insolvency Laws

```

Insolvency or bankruptcy laws deal with the following issues:

   - who can file for bankruptcy;
   - the weight that the courts dealing with bankruptcy will give to
creditors, equity investors, and other stakeholders;

   - whether the company's management will be permitted to continue to
manage the enterprise;

  - the type of bankruptcy arrangement permitted (liquidation or
reorganization); and

   - whether there will be an automatic injunction that prevents creditors
from recovering their debt when a company files for bankruptcy
(referred to as an "automatic stay").

Preconditions must be satisfied for business enterprises to use the

country's insolvency laws. If these conditions are satisfied, a business

enterprise itself can apply for bankruptcy, referred to a **voluntary**

**bankruptcy**, or its creditors can force it into bankruptcy, referred to an

**involuntary bankruptcy** . After analyzing the conditions for bankruptcy for

about 42 countries, one study finds that "as a whole, most countries make

the inability to pay off debts the basic condition for bankruptcy." [12]

There is a priority of payments to creditors. Most countries follow

priority rules for creditors whereby senior creditors paid in full before

junior creditors are paid anything. Most countries give priority to secured

creditors over employee creditors (i.e., amount due to employees for their

compensation owed). This occurs depending on the development of a

country's financial market. Countries that give priority to secured creditors

- ver employee creditors do so because in the early stage of economic
development, raising capital in the financial market is viewed as being more
important than the need for labor. [13]

A common objective of the bankruptcy laws in most countries is the

ability to allow the business entity to work out with creditors a financial

plan to enable it to satisfy some creditor obligations and remain in business

as a new business entity. This is referred to a **reorganization** - f the

business entity. Bankruptcy rules deal with how reorganization is to take

place. Some holders of claims against the bankrupt business entity receive

cash in exchange for their claims, others may receive new securities in the

new business entity that results from the reorganization, and others may

receive a combination of both cash and new securities in the resulting

business entity. In contrast to a reorganization is the **liquidation** - f a

business entity. In a liquidation, all the assets of the bankrupt business

entity will be distributed to the holders of claims, and no business entity

will come into existence.

```
The U.S. Bankruptcy System

```

The law governing bankruptcy in the United States is the Bankruptcy

Reform Act of 1978 and its amendments. This act sets forth the rules for a

corporation to be either liquidated or reorganized. Another purpose of the

bankruptcy act is to give a corporation time to decide whether to reorganize

- r liquidate, and then the necessary time to formulate a plan to accomplish
either decision. The time is allowed because when a corporation files for
bankruptcy, the act grants the corporation protection from creditors who
seek to collect their claims. The petition for bankruptcy can be filed either
by the company itself (i.e., a voluntary bankruptcy) or by its creditors (an
involuntary bankruptcy). A company that files for protection under the
bankruptcy act generally becomes a "debtor in possession" and continues to

- perate its business under the supervision of the court.

The bankruptcy act consists of 15 chapters, each chapter covering a

particular type of bankruptcy. Of particular interest are Chapter 7 and

Chapter 11 bankruptcies. Chapter 7 deals with the liquidation of a company;

Chapter 11 deals with the reorganization of a company.

**`Priority: Theory and practice`** When a company is liquidated,
creditors receive distribution based on the absolute priority rule to the
extent assets are available. The **absolute priority rule** holds that senior
creditors are to be paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything. For
secured creditors and unsecured creditors, this rule guarantees their
seniority to equity holders.

In liquidations, the absolute priority rule generally holds. In contrast, a

good body of literature argues that in reorganizations, strict absolute

priority is not upheld by the courts or the SEC. [14] Studies of actual

reorganizations under Chapter 11 find that the violation of absolute priority

is the rule rather than the exception. [15]

Failure of the courts to follow strict absolute priority creates

implications for the capital structure decision (i.e., the choice between debt

and equity) of a firm. The view of financial economists that the firm is

effectively owned by the creditors who sold the shareholders a call option

- n the firm's assets is not sustainable if the stockholders are not viewed as

residual claimants. [16]

Several hypotheses have been suggested as to why, in a reorganization,

the distribution made to claimants diverges from that required by the

absolute priority principle. The **incentive hypothesis** argues that the longer

the negotiation process among the parties continues, the greater will be the

bankruptcy costs and the smaller the amount to be distributed to all parties.

In a reorganization, a committee representing the various claim holders is

appointed for the purpose of formulating a plan of reorganization. To be

accepted, a plan of reorganization must be approved by the parties.

Consequently, a lengthy bargaining process is expected. The longer the

negotiation process among the parties takes, the more likely it is that the

company will be operated in a manner not in the best interest of the

creditors, and, as a result, the smaller will be the amount to be distributed to

all parties. Because all impaired classes, including equity holders, generally

must approve the plan of reorganization, creditors often convince equity

holders to accept the plan by offering to distribute some value to them.

The **recontracting process hypothesis** argues that the violation of

absolute priority reflects a recontracting process between stockholders and

senior creditors that acknowledges the ability of management to preserve

value on behalf of stockholders. [17] According to the **stockholders' influence**

**on reorganization plan hypothesis**, creditors are less informed about the
true economic operating conditions of the firm than is management.
Because the distribution to creditors in the plan of reorganization is based

- n the valuation by the firm, creditors without perfect information suffer the
loss. [18] According to Karen Hooper Wruck, managers generally have a better
understanding than do creditors or stockholders of a firm's internal

- perations, whereas creditors and stockholders can have better information

about industry trends. Management may therefore use its superior

knowledge to present the data in a manner that reinforces its position. [19]

The essence of the **strategic bargaining process hypothesis** is that the

increasing complexity of firms that declare bankruptcy accentuates the

negotiating process and results in an even higher incidence of violation of

the absolute priority rule. The likely outcome is further supported by the

increased number of official committees in the reorganization process, as

well as the increased number of financial and legal advisers.

Some observers have argued that creditors receive a higher value in

reorganization than they would in liquidation, in part because of the costs

associated with liquidation. [20] Finally, the lack of symmetry in the tax

system (negative taxes are not permitted, although loss deductions may be

carried forward) results in situations in which the only way to use all

current loss deductions is to merge. [21] The tax system may encourage

continuance or merger and discourage bankruptcy.

Consequently, although investors in the debt of a corporation may feel

that they have priority over the equity owners and priority over other

classes of debtors, the actual outcome of a bankruptcy may be far different

from what the terms of the debt agreement state.

Fabozzi, Howe, Makabe, and Sudo examined the extent of violation of

the absolute priority rule among three broad groups—secured creditors,

unsecured creditors, and equity holders—and among various types of debt

and equity securities. [22] They also provide evidence on which asset class

bears the cost of violations of absolute priority, and an initial estimate of

total distributed value relative to liquidation value. Their findings suggest

that unsecured creditors bear a disproportionate cost of reorganization,

senior unsecured creditors may bear a disproportionate cost relative to the

junior unsecured creditors, and equity holders often benefit from violations

- f absolute priority.

Key Points

```

- Corporate debt obligations include commercial paper, bank loans, bonds,
medium-term notes, asset-backed securities, and equipment leases.

- Corporate debt obligations take priority over holders of a
corporation's common stock in the case of bankruptcy.

- Corporate bank loans, an alternative to the issuance of securities, are
classified as investment-grade loans and leveraged bank loans.

- Leveraged bank loans are sold to institutional investors and traded in
a secondary market.

- Although bank loans to corporations include both types of bank
loans, it is common in the market to use the terms "bank loan" and
"leveraged loan" interchangeably.

- In a syndicated bank loan, a group of banks provides funds to the
borrower.

- Corporate bonds are debts obligating a corporation to pay periodic
interest, with full repayment by maturity.

- The promises of the corporate bond issuer and the rights of the
investors are set forth in the bond indenture.

- Provisions to be specified include call and sinking fund provisions.
- Security for bonds may be real or personal property.
- Debenture bonds are not secured with a specific pledge of property.
- Subordinated debenture bonds are issues that rank after secured debt,
after debenture bonds, and often after some general creditors in their
claim on assets and earnings.

- Special corporate bond features include convertible and
exchangeable bonds, units of debt with warrants, putable bonds, zerocoupon bonds, and floating-rate securities.

- High-yield bonds are issues with a credit rating below triple B.
- There are several complex bond structures in the high-yield bond
sector, particularly bonds issued for leveraged buyout (LBO) financing
and recapitalizations producing higher levels of debt to equity.

- High-yield bond structures include deferred-coupon bonds (deferredinterest bonds, step-up bonds, and payment-in-kind bonds) and
extendable reset bonds.

- Focusing on the default rates of corporate bonds does not provide
sufficient insight into the risks and rewards of investing in corporate
bonds. An investor must look at both the default rate and the recovery

rate.

- The default loss rate is defined as the product of the default rate and
(1 − recovery rate).

- Several different methods can be used to compute default rates.
- Secondary trading information for corporate bonds is provided by
the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE).

- Electronic corporate bond trading systems are of five types: auction
systems, cross-matching systems, interdealer systems, multidealer
systems, and single-dealer systems.

- EU regulations and directives deal with a wide range of issues for
bonds, with the major legislation focusing on conduct by market
participants, stability of the financial system, and market transparency.

- The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), Level
1, improves transparency for the secondary bond market with respect
to the reporting of post-trade details and pre-trade indicative quotes.

- A medium-term note (MTN) is a corporate debt instrument with the
unique characteristic that such notes are offered continuously to
investors by an agent of the issuer.

- Investors in an MTN can select from several maturity ranges: nine
months to one year, more than one year to 18 months, more than 18
months to two years, and so on up to 30 years.

- MTNs differ from corporate bonds in the manner by which they are
initially distributed to investors: Unlike a typical investment-grade
corporate bond offering that is underwritten by investment bankers,
MTNs are sold on a best-efforts basis.

- Another difference between corporate bonds and MTNs when they
are offered is that MTNs are usually sold in relatively small amounts

- n a continuous or an intermittent basis, whereas corporate bonds are
sold in large, discrete offerings.

- In the United States, a corporation that wants an MTN program will
file a shelf registration with the SEC for the offering of securities.

- Issuers of MTNs often couple their offerings with transactions in the
derivative markets (options, futures/forward contracts, swaps, caps,
and floors) so as to create debt obligations with more attractive
risk/return features than are available in the corporate bond market;
such MTNs are referred to as "structured MTNs."

- Leasing is a form of bank borrowing that is basically a vehicle by
which tax benefits can be transferred from the user of the equipment
(the lessee), who may not have the capacity to utilize the tax benefits
associated with equipment ownership, to another entity that can utilize
them.

- A single-investor lease is a two-party agreement involving the lessee
and the lessor.

- In a leveraged lease, the lessor uses only a portion of its own funds
to purchase the equipment and borrows the balance from a bank or
group of banks.

- Insolvency or bankruptcy laws deal with (1) who can file for
bankruptcy, (2) the weight that the courts will give to creditors, equity
investors, and other stakeholders in a bankruptcy proceeding, (3)
whether management will be permitted to continue to manage the
enterprise, (4) the type of bankruptcy arrangement permitted
(liquidation or reorganization), and (5) whether there will be an
automatic injunction that prevents creditors from recovering their debt
when a company files for bankruptcy.

- In a voluntary bankruptcy, a business enterprise itself can apply for
bankruptcy; in an involuntary bankruptcy, the creditors can force it
into bankruptcy.

- Bankruptcy rules deal with how reorganization is to take place.
- In a reorganization, some holders of claims against the bankrupt
business entity receive cash in exchange for their claims, others may
receive new securities in the new business entity that results from the

reorganization, and yet others may receive a combination of both cash

and new securities in the resulting business entity.

   - In a liquidation of a business entity, all the assets of the bankrupt
business entity will be distributed to the holders of claims, and no
business entity will come into existence.

  - The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 governs the bankruptcy
process in the United States.

   - Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy act deals with the liquidation of a
company; Chapter 11 deals with the reorganization of a company.

   - In theory, creditors receive distributions based on the absolute
priority rule to the extent that assets are available, meaning that senior
creditors are paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything.

  - In practice, the absolute priority rule holds in the case of
liquidations, but this rule is typically violated in a reorganization.

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - how asset-backed securities are created;
   - the basic structure of a securitization;
   - who the parties to a securitization are;
   - how financial markets benefit from securitization;
   - what is meant by originate-to-hold and originate-to-distribute
approaches pursued by financial institutions;

   - the concerns about securitization;
   - how corporations can reduce funding costs via securitization;
   - the role of the special-purpose vehicle;
   - regulation of securitization resulting from the recent global financial
crisis;

   - the purpose of risk-retention rules in securitization regulation; and
   - how corporations can use securitization to manage risks.

In this chapter, we focus on a vehicle used by financial and nonfinancial

corporations for raising debt. This financial instrument, referred to as

"asset-backed security," is created through a process referred to as **asset**

**securitization** - r simply **securitization** . The creation of securitized

products was primarily done in the United States until the late 1980s, when

it became a technique used in some European countries. One reason for the

late development of securitized products outside the United States is that

the process requires the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework

that allows for the benefits of securitization. Although the major type of

securitization that has taken place throughout the world involves the

securitization of residential real estate mortgage loans, nonbanks and banks

have created products backed by a wide range of non–real estate consumer

loans and receivables. For example, banks and subsidiaries of automobile

manufacturers have securitized automobile loans and leases.

In this chapter, we explain the securitization process and the types of

bonds created by the process, the role of securitization in financial markets,

and the public policy issues concerning securitization following the

financial crisis of 2008–2009. This chapter provides an overview of

securitization used by corporations. In chapter 30, we take a close look at a

major sector of the securitization market, the market for securitized bonds

backed by U.S. residential mortgage loans issued by a government agency

and two government-sponsored enterprises. This market is so large that it

warrants its own chapter.

```
Securitization and the Creation of a Securitized Product

```

To explain how a securitized product is created and the parties to a

securitization, we will use an illustration. Suppose that FAF Lab Equipment

Inc. manufactures high-quality equipment used by both medical and clinical

laboratories throughout the world. Although the company has cash sales,

the bulk of its sales come from installment sales contracts. An installment

sale contract is a loan to the buyer of the laboratory equipment (e.g., a

dental, medical, or clinical laboratory) wherein the buyer agrees to repay

FAF Laboratory Equipment Inc. over a specified period of time for the

amount borrowed plus interest. The laboratory equipment purchased is the

collateral for the loan. We will assume that the loans are all for five years.

The credit department of FAF Lab Equipment Inc. makes the decision as

to whether to extend credit to a customer. That is, the credit department

receives a credit application from a potential customer and, based on

criteria established by the company, decides whether to make a loan. The

criteria for granting a loan are referred to as "underwriting standards."

Because FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is granting the loan, the company is

referred to as the .

**originator of the loan**

Moreover, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. may have a department that is

responsible for servicing the loan. **Servicing** involves collecting payments

from borrowers, notifying borrowers who may be delinquent, and, when

necessary, recovering and disposing of the collateral (the laboratory

equipment, in our illustration) if the borrower fails to make the contractual

loan payments. Although the servicer of the loans need not be the originator

- f the loans, in our illustration, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is the servicer.

Now let's get to how these loans are used in a securitization transaction.

We assume that FAF Lab Equipment Inc. has more than \$300 million of

installment sales contracts. We further assume that FAF Lab Equipment Inc.

wants to raise \$300 million. Rather than issuing corporate bonds for \$300

million, the treasurer of the corporation decides to raise the funds through a

securitization. To do so, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. will set up a legal entity

referred to as a **special-purpose vehicle** (SPV). At this point we will not

explain the purpose of this legal entity, but it will become clear later that the

SPV is critical in a securitization transaction.

In our illustration, the SPV that is set up is called "FAF Asset Trust"

(FAFAT). FAF Lab Equipment Inc. will then sell to FAFAT \$300 million of

the loans. FAF Lab Equipment Inc. will receive from FAFAT \$300 million

in cash, the amount of funds it wanted to raise. FAFAT obtains the \$300

million by selling securities that are backed by the \$300 million of loans.

The securities are the asset-backed securities mentioned above.

In the prospectus for a securitization issued in the United States, these

securities are usually referred to as "certificates."

```
The Parties to a Securitization

```

Let's clarify the parties to a securitization. In our hypothetical

securitization, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is not the issuer of the securitized

product (although it is sometimes referred to as the "issuer," because it is

the entity that ultimately raises the funds). Instead, it originated the loans.

Hence, in this transaction, FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is referred to by

different names: "seller" or "depositor" or "originator." The reason it is

referred to as the "seller" is because it sells the receivables to FAFAT. It is

referred to as the "depositor," because it deposits the receivables into the

pool of loans. And FAF Lab Equipment Inc. may be referred to as the

"originator," because it originated the receivables. In practice, FAF Lab

Equipment Inc. might have a subsidiary that is a captive finance company

whose responsibility is to finance the product of the parent company. In that

case, the captive finance company would be the seller, depositor, or

- riginator.

The SPV in a securitization is referred to as the "issuer" or in some

countries, the "trust" in the prospectus. In our simple transaction, FAF Lab

Equipment Inc. manufactured the lab equipment and originated the loans.

The critical role of the SPV will be explained later.

There will be a trustee for the securities issued. The responsibilities of

the trustee are to represent the interests of the bond classes by monitoring

compliance with covenants and, in the event of default, to enforce remedies

as specified in the governing documents. [1]

```
Securitized Products Created and Transaction Structure

```

The end result of a securitization is the creation of securities that are

generically referred to as **asset-backed securities** (ABSs). In a

securitization prospectus, ABSs are referred to as "certificates," "assetbacked notes," and "bond classes." In the market, the terminology often

used to describe the securities created is "tranches."

A securitization has transaction structure. This refers to the securities

created, the rules that set forth the way in which the losses are to be

distributed among the securities in the structure, the rules for the

distribution of interest each month among the securities in the structure, and

the rules for the distribution of principal repayment among the securities in

the structures. The rules are referred to as the structure "waterfall."

Let's look at some different types of structure, starting with a simple one

using the FAF Lab Equipment Inc. sale of receivables to FAFAT—the SPV

and issuer of the securities. Suppose in the bond structure there are three

bond classes, A, B, and C. Recall that the total amount of the receivables in

that hypothetical securitization transaction is \$300 million and that the par

amount of the bond classes sold is the same amount. Let's assume that the

par value of bond class A is \$260 million, bond class B is \$30 million, and

bond class C is \$10 million, and that the rules for the distribution of the

losses from the pool of receivables backing this securitization are as

follows:

   - Losses on the pool of receivables are first allocated to bond class C
up to \$10 million (the par amount of that bond class).

   - Subsequent losses on the pool of receivables are then allocated to
bond class B up to \$30 million (the par amount of that bond class)
above the \$10 million loss absorbed by bond class C.

   - Finally, should losses on the pool of receivables exceed \$40 million,
losses are then absorbed by bond class A.

For the distribution of principal when it is paid by the borrowers, the rules

are:

   - Pay bond class A with all principal received up to the amount of its
par value (\$260 million).

   - Once bond class A is fully repaid its par amount of \$260 million, the
principal received is distributed to bond class B up to its par value of
\$30 million.

   - Finally, after bond class B is paid off, any additional principal is paid
to bond class C.

Let's consider what happens under different situations with respect to

losses on the pool of receivables. Suppose that the total loss for the pool of

receivables over the life of the securities is \$6 million. In this case, bond

class A and bond class B will be repaid their par value in full. However,

bond class C will absorb the loss of \$6 million and therefore receive only

\$4 million of the \$10 million par value. If the total loss for the pool of

receivables over the life of the securities is \$28 million, then bond class C

receives no principal, and bond class A receives the entire principal.

However, bond class B must absorb the loss above \$10 million that is

absorbed by bond class C. That amount is \$18 million (\$28 million − \$10

million). Consequently, bond class B will receive only \$12 million of its par

value (\$30 million − \$18 million). Finally, let's consider the case where the

loss is \$60 million. In this case, neither bond class B nor bond class C will

receive any principal, and bond class A must absorb the excess losses that

the two other bond classes absorbed. That excess is \$20 million (= \$60

million − \$10 million − \$30 million), and therefore bond class A will

receive \$240 in principal rather than its par amount of \$260 million.

Notice what has happened in this structure. Bond class C is providing

credit support against losses from the pool of receivables for bond class A

and bond class B up to \$10 million. Moreover, bond class B is providing

credit support against losses from the pool of receivables for bond class A

up to an additional \$30 million above that provided by bond class C. For

this reason, we say that bond class B and bond class C are "subordinated"

bond classes. Because bond class C is the first to absorb the losses, it is

referred to as the "first-loss" piece. We also say that because bond class A is

not providing credit support for the other two bond classes, it is the **senior**

**bond class** . The structure itself is a **senior-subordinated structure** .

We discuss the credit risk and the senior-subordinated structure in the

next section. Here we note only that each bond class will receive a credit

rating. The senior bond class will receive the highest credit rating, and the

two subordinated bond classes will receive lower credit ratings. More

specifically, bond class B will receive a lower credit rating than bond class

A but a higher credit rating than bond class C, because bond class B is

being provided credit support by bond class C.

As should be apparent, the purpose of this structure is to redistribute the

credit risk associated with the collateral (i.e., pool of receivables). This

process is referred to as "credit tranching"—that is, a set of bond classes is

created to allow investors a choice in the amount of credit risk they prefer

to bear.

Let's add one more wrinkle to the structure. Suppose that the structure is

as follows, where bond classes B and C are the subordinated bond classes,

as in the previous structure, but there are four senior bond classes, A1, A2,

A3, and A4:

Bond Class Par Value ($ millions)

A1 (senior) 150

A2 (senior) 60

A3 (senior) 30

A4 (senior) 20

B (subordinated) 30

C (subordinated) 10

Total 300

In this structure, the two subordinated bond classes, B and C, provide

credit support for all senior bond classes. Once again we see credit

tranching. In contrast to the prior structure, however, there is not one senior

bond class but four. The rule for the distribution of principal payments to

the senior bond classes is as follows:

   - All principal is paid to bond class A1 until that bond class is paid its
par value of \$150 million.

   - Once bond class A1 is paid off, then all principal is paid to bond
class A2 until that bond class is paid its par value of \$60 million.

   - Once bond class A2 is paid off, then all principal is paid to bond
class A3 until that bond class is paid its par value of \$30 million.

   - Once bond class A3 is paid off, then all principal is paid to bond
class A4 until that bond class is paid its par value of \$20 million.

Once all senior bonds are paid off, the rules for the distribution of

principal are the same as in the prior structure:

   - The principal received is distributed to bond class B up to its par
value of \$30 million.

   - Finally, after bond class B is paid off, any additional principal is paid
to bond class C.

In this example, it should be clear that the senior bond classes are not

providing credit support for any other senior bond classes. Suppose that at

the end of three years, the following situation exists:

1. There are no losses for the pool of receivables through year 3, but
in the first month of year 4, the pool suffers a \$60 million loss.
2. The principal paid to bond class A1 through year 3 is \$70 million.

Thus as of the end of the first month in year 4, the two subordinated

bond classes are wiped out (i.e., will not receive any principal). The

principal due (before adjustment for the losses) is the same as when the

securitization was issued, with the exception that bond class A1 has a par

value that is reduced by the \$60 million principal paid to that bond class.

That is, the par value is \$90 million (\$150 million − \$60 million). So we

now have the following situation before the adjustment for the loss of

receivables above and beyond what was allocated to the two bond classes:

Bond Class Par Value ($ millions)

A1 (senior) 90

A2 (senior) 60

A3 (senior) 30

A4 (senior) 20

Total 200

The four senior bond classes must be allocated the loss not absorbed by the

two subordinate bond classes. That amount is \$20 million: the loss of \$60

million minus the \$40 million that the two subordinated bond classes

absorbed. Because the par value at the beginning of year 4 is \$200 for all

senior bond classes in total, that means each senior bond class has to be

allocated 10% of the loss (\$20 million to be allocated divided by \$200

million in par value for the senior bonds). So the principal owed to each

bond class is as follows:

Bond Class Par Value ($ millions)

A1 (senior) 81

A2 (senior) 54

A3 (senior) 27

A4 (senior) 18

Total 180

What was accomplished by carving up the senior bond into four bond

classes that are paid off sequentially? Effectively, the senior bond class

(bond class A) in the prior structure had a certain maturity. With the use of

four senior bond classes, bonds with different maturities can be created

(we'll see this in more detail in chapter 30). Consequently, carving up a

senior bond class is referred to as **time tranching** (i.e., creating bonds with

different maturities). Therefore, this structure has both time tranching for

the senior bond class (through the creation of bond classes A1, A2, A3, and

A4) and credit tranching (through the creation of the senior bond classes

and the two subordinate bond classes B and C).

The first-loss piece (i.e., the first bond class to absorb losses from the

collateral) is critical in a structure. As we'll see when we discuss the

concerns about securitization, investors are concerned that the

loans/receivables in the pool be properly underwritten. Because the

- riginator of loans/receivables is not going to hold those assets on its
balance sheet but instead will package those assets and distribute them to
the public through a securitization, how does one control for this moral
hazard problem (i.e., the poor underwriting of loans)?

In the United States and Europe, as explained later in this chapter, there

are regulations requiring that originators retain in their portfolio the firstloss piece, for the purpose of placing originators at risk if they underwrite

poor credit loans.

```
Benefits of Securitization to Financial Markets

```

As we stress throughout this book, some vehicles have been introduced into

financial markets to reduce the reliance of borrowers on banks. High-yield

corporate bonds, the subject of chapter 26, are one example of such

vehicles. Securitized bonds issued through the securitization process are

another example.

Just before the onset of the global financial crisis, which can be traced

back to the subprime mortgage crisis starting in the early summer of 2007

- a crisis allegedly caused in part by securitization—major public officials
in the United States were commenting on the critical role of securitization
in the financial markets. For example, several months after the beginning of
the financial crisis, then–U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson,
Jr., described securitization in a speech as "a process that has been
extremely valuable in extending the availability of credit to millions of
homeowners nationwide and lowering their cost of financing." [2]

On June 1, 2008, José Manuel González-Páramo, a member of the

executive board of the European Central Bank (the central bank for the

Eurozone and the monetary policy administrator of the 17 EU countries),

described the benefits of securitization for banks as follows:

The securitization of their loan portfolios has provided banks with access to an additional funding

source and enabled them to mitigate some of the risks intrinsically related to their core business of

liquidity transformation.… By allowing banks to transform their illiquid assets into marketable

securities and providing an additional source of funding to expand lending, securitization provides an

effective mechanism to mitigate such risks and reduces the role in liquidity transformation

traditionally performed by depository banks. [3]

Some observers think that in Asia, securitization will play an even more

critical role than in the United States and Europe, for two reasons. [4] First, in

contrast to the developed bond markets in the United States and Europe, the

Asian bond market is still underdeveloped. Second, funding by Asian

companies is still highly dependent on banks. Securitization offers a means

for developing the Asian bond and moving countries away from relying

solely on the banking system. The same is true in Russia.

Finally, in January 2012, John Walsh, then acting U.S. comptroller of the

currency, stated the following about securitization, which drives home the

key point about its benefits:

Securitization is sometimes maligned and frequently misunderstood, and its importance to our

nation's economy is often not fully appreciated. Whether in mortgages, credit cards, auto finance, or

student loans, meeting the needs of American consumers depends heavily on securitization. It is hard

to imagine full recovery of the financial system without the liquidity and funding avenues provided

by a well functioning securitization market. [5]

It should be clear at this point that securitization plays a critical role in

financial markets. Let's tie this observation into our earlier discussion of the

important role of financial intermediation for a financial market, and more

specifically, the three economic functions of financial intermediaries, which

are (1) to provide maturity intermediation, (2) to reduce risk through

diversification, and (3) to reduce the costs of contracting and information

processing (see chapter 3). However, securitization is a vehicle for raising

funds directly in the public market without the need for a financial

intermediary. That is, securitization results in financial disintermediation.

Let's see how securitization can fulfill the three economic roles of

financial intermediaries. First, a pool of loans can be used to create ABSs

with different maturity ranges. For example, as explained earlier in this

chapter, time tranching can be used to create securitized vehicles with

maturities that are short, intermediate, and long term. (In chapter 30, we

illustrate this principle with a pool of 30-year residential mortgage loans.)

Hence, securitization provides maturity intermediation.

Second, diversification within an asset type is accomplished because of

the large number of loans in a typical securitization. Hence, securitization

reduces risk through diversification.

Finally, the costs of contracting and information processing are provided

for in asset securitization. The contracting costs are provided by the

- riginator of the loans. Information processing is provided at two levels.
The first is when a loan is originated. The second is when a credit rating
agency rates the individual ABSs in the transaction.

The key benefit of securitization to financial markets is that it allows the

creation of tradable securities with better liquidity for financial claims that

would otherwise have remained in the portfolio of financial intermediaries

and would therefore be highly illiquid. For example, very few institutional

- r individual investors would be willing to invest in residential mortgage
loans, automobile loans, or credit card receivables. Yet they would be
willing to invest in a security backed by these loan types. By making
financial assets tradable in this way, securitization (1) reduces agency costs,
thereby making financial markets more efficient, and (2) improves liquidity
for the underlying financial claims, thereby reducing liquidity risk in the
financial system.

```
Concerns about Securitization

```

The major benefits of securitization do not come without a significant

potential risk. To understand the major risk, let's look at the traditional

approach to lending followed by banks, and then be more specific and

consider the process for originating loans to purchase residential property.

First we consider the approach taken by a bank when it originates a loan

to purchase a property and, after origination, the bank retains the loan on its

balance sheet. The approach is referred to as the "originate-to-hold"

approach, with the "hold" meaning that the bank will retain the loan in its

portfolio. In this approach, the bank's lending officer reviews an applicant's

request for a loan. The applicant provides information about his or her

credit history and employment history, as well as information about the

property to be purchased. The lending officer retains the services of a

competent appraiser (employed by the bank or an independent third party)

to assess the property's attributes and obtain an appraised value. Based on

the due diligence performed by the lending officer, the loan is either

approved or denied. If approved, the loan is held in the bank's portfolio.

The performance of the loan portfolio in terms of defaults is closely

monitored by bank management, and problem loans in the portfolio are

investigated. If it is determined that the lending officer or the appraiser

failed to properly assess the credit risk of the loan, then action is taken

against the individual or individuals responsible. Because the bank is at risk

for the loans, it will exercise the necessary due diligence to minimize that

risk.

Now let's consider the case involving securitization. This approach

involves what is referred to as the "originate-to-distribute" approach. In this

case, a bank may either originate loans with the intent to securitize them or

the bank may purchase loans originated by other entities (e.g., acquired

from mortgage banking firms that are subsidiaries of the bank). Employees

- f these other entities who originate loans, as well as the entities
themselves, receive compensation from loans that are approved. Because
the loans will be sold to a bank, which will then include those loans in a
securitization and not hold them in its portfolio, the credit evaluation
process breaks down. The entities originating the loans have an incentive to
approve as many loans as possible to generate revenue from loans approved
and for the bank not to re-underwrite the loans it purchases, because the
loans will not be held by the bank. Instead, the bank generates fees
associated with a securitization (i.e., earning a higher interest rate on the
loans in the pool of loans backing a securitization than it has to pay to the
investors in the securitized bonds). The economic incentives to originate as
many loans as possible that can eventually be securitized without bearing
the credit risk is the major concern that arises in securitization.

```
Need for the Development of an Accommodating Legal Structure

```

A market for securitized products cannot efficiently develop until a legal

structure is in place that can accommodate securitization. Here we explain

the role of the SPV, the entity in a securitization that we have touched on

- nly briefly. Indeed, without a provision equivalent to an SPV in the trust

law of a country seeking to develop a market for securitized products, the

benefits of securitization by an entity seeking to raise funds would be

limited. Law based on case law or precedent is called "common law" and is

based on judicial decisions. A trust is a relationship that involves one party

holding property on behalf of another party, and it is also based on a

common law system. In a securitization, therefore, a trust is created (the

SPV), and the treatment of that trust is based on a country's common law

system.

```
Role of the SPV

```

Let's illustrate this pivotal role of the SPV using our hypothetical case of

FAF Lab Equipment Inc., a corporation that has a credit rating obtained

from a credit rating agency. For illustrative purposes, let's suppose that the

credit rating assigned to FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is single B. Such a credit

rating means that FAF Lab Equipment Inc. has a noninvestment-grade

rating.

Recall that the treasurer of FAF Lab Equipment Inc. wants to raise \$300

million. One alternative is to issue a five-year corporate bond rather than

use securitization to issue a securitized bond. A major concern of the firm's

treasurer is the cost of borrowing (i.e., the interest rate) that would be paid

- n the corporate bond. The treasurer's primary objective is to obtain the
lowest possible interest rate available. Interest rates or funding costs are
measured as a spread over some benchmark. Let's suppose that the
benchmark interest rate is the U.S. Treasury rate of the same maturity as the
corporate bond that would be issued. Because we are assuming that the
treasurer would issue a five-year corporate bond, the interest rate would be
the five-year Treasury rate plus a spread, and that spread reflects the
compensation investors want in order to be induced to purchase the
corporate bond. The rating assigned to the corporate bond issue by the
credit rating agency will be the major factor affecting the size of the spread.
Another factor that influences the spread arising from credit risk is the
collateral that might be used for the bond issue. As explained in chapter 26,
a corporate bond that has collateral is a secured bond and would be
expected to reduce the credit spread by a small amount compared to the

spread on a corporate bond that has no collateral (i.e., an unsecured

corporate bond). The treasurer can use the loans as collateral for the secured

corporate bond offering. So if FAF Lab Equipment Inc. issues a five-year

corporate bond to raise \$300 million, then, with its credit rating of single B,

the credit spread will reflect its credit rating primarily and the collateral

slightly. We'll see why the collateral would have only a slight impact on the

credit spread.

Now suppose that instead of using the loans to its customers as collateral

for a secured corporate bond issue, the treasurer of FAF Lab Equipment Inc.

undertakes a securitization by creating a legal entity and selling the

contracts in an arm's-length transaction to that entity, the SPV, which we

called "FAFAT" earlier in the chapter. In our illustration of the mechanics of

a securitization, after the sale of the receivables by FAF Lab Equipment Inc.

to FAFAT is completed, FAFAT legally owns the receivables, not FAF Lab

Equipment Inc. As a result, if FAF Lab Equipment Inc. is ever forced into

bankruptcy while the receivables sold are still outstanding, FAF Lab

Equipment Inc.'s creditors cannot recover the receivables, because they are

legally owned by FAFAT.

As a result of securitization, then, when the SPV (FAFAT, in our

illustration) issues the securitized bonds that are backed by the cash flow

from the pool of loans, investors contemplating the purchase of any bond

class in the securitization structure will evaluate the credit risk associated

with collecting the payments due on the receivables independent of FAF

Lab Equipment Inc.'s credit rating.

The credit ratings will be assigned to the different bond classes created

in the securitization and will reflect how the credit rating agencies evaluate

the credit risk based on the expected performance of the collateral (i.e., the

pool of loans). As a result of the SPV, the quality of the collateral, and the

capital structure of the SPV (i.e., the number of senior and subordinated

bond classes), a corporation can raise funds through a securitization in

which some of the bond classes have a better credit rating than the

corporation itself that is seeking to raise funds. And so in the aggregate, the

funding cost is less than that of issuing a secured corporate bond. This is the

key role of the SPV in a securitization.

It is important to understand why a securitization may have a lower

funding cost than a corporate bond secured by the same collateral as the

securitization. The reason lies in the treatment of secured creditors in the

case of a corporate reorganization in many countries. In the United States,

for example, during the liquidation of a corporation, the absolute priority

rule dictates how the bankrupt corporation's assets are to be distributed

among creditors and stockholders (see chapter 26). The absolute priority

rule is the principle that senior creditors are paid in full before junior

creditors are paid anything. For secured creditors and unsecured creditors,

the absolute priority rule guarantees their seniority to equity holders. In

liquidations, the absolute priority rule generally holds. In contrast, it is well

documented that in actual reorganizations, the courts have not followed

strict absolute priority rules when distributing assets. Consequently,

although investors in the debt of a corporation may feel they have priority

- ver the equity owners and priority over other classes of debtholders, in
practice, the actual outcome of a bankruptcy may deviate greatly from the
terms of the debt agreement. That is, there is no assurance that if a
corporate bond has collateral (i.e., is a secured bond), the rights of the
debtholders will be respected should a reorganization occur. It is for this
reason that the credit spread does not decrease dramatically for a secured
bond compared to that for an unsecured bond. In contrast, for a
securitization, the courts have no discretion. This is because no bankruptcy
takes place. Instead, there are only rules (i.e., the "waterfall," or the rules
for distributing losses, interest, and repayment of principal among the
securities in a structure) that the trustee must follow when cash flow is
received from the pool of loans. Those rules specify how the losses are to
be absorbed by each bond class in the securitization's capital structure.

An actual example of the cost reduction benefit of securitization should

make this clear. Our example is that of Ford Motor Company, an

automobile manufacturer. Beginning in 2000, there were concerns that the

credit rating of Ford would be downgraded. The company has a captive

finance company, Ford Motor Credit, whose credit rating would also be

downgraded. However, the captive finance company had the ability to

securitize its auto loans to customers, and it issued a securitized bond. What

Ford Motor Credit did was reduce its exposure from \$42 billion to \$8

billion of standard corporate bond issuance, substituting the sale of

securitized automobile loans that carried the highest credit rating, triple A.

In fact, from 2000 to mid-2003, Ford Motor Credit increased securitizations

to \$55 billion (28% of its total funding) from \$25 billion (13% of its total

funding). Also, even though the credit ratings of not only Ford Motor

Company but also the other major auto manufacturers were downgraded in

May 2005, the credit ratings on several of the securitization transactions of

these automobile manufacturers were not downgraded. In fact, some were

upgraded.

Understanding this important decoupling of the credit risk of the entity

needing funds and the bond classes issued by the SPV should make it clear

that the SPV's legal role is critical. This occurs in the United States because

- f the treatment of SPVs by the legal system. That is, despite several
challenges that have occurred (discussed next), the assets in a properly
structured securitization belong to the SPV, not to the entity that sold the
assets to the SPV in exchange for funds.

However, other countries may not have the same legal framework as the

United States. This is why outside the United States, there have been

impediments in some countries with respect to the issuance of securitized

bonds created from a securitization, because the concept of trust law does

not exist.

```
Legal Challenge in the United States

```

The long-standing view is that investors in ABSs are protected from the

creditors of the seller of the collateral. That is, when the seller of the

collateral transfers it to the trust (the SPV), the transfer represents a "true

sale," and therefore, in case of the seller's bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court

cannot penetrate the trust to recover the collateral or cash flow from the

collateral. However, this issue has never been fully tested. The closest

challenge was the bankruptcy of LTV Steel Company. In the bankruptcy,

LTV argued that its securitizations were not true sales and therefore it

should be entitled to the cash flows it had transferred to the trust. Although

the case was settled and the settlement included a summary finding that

LTV's securitizations were a true sale, the court's decision to permit LTV to

use the cash flows prior to the settlement is a major concern for investors.

```
Securitization Regulation

```

The abuses and problems identified by the global financial crisis led to one

- f the most significant changes in the regulation of financial markets
throughout the world. Although the abuses were due to the securitization of
real estate loans (which we describe in chapter 30) and collateralized debt

- bligation (securitization technology applied to the pooling of debt
instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities and certain types of
ABSs), the postcrisis financial regulations apply to securitization in general.

Steven Schwarcz classifies the regulations dealing with securitization

into four categories: increasing disclosure, requiring risk retention,

reforming credit rating agencies, and imposing capital requirements. [6] The

last category involves rules with respect to risk-backed capital requirement

described in chapter 6. Reforming credit rating agencies was included by

regulators because of the questionable practices of these entities when

rating certain types of mortgage-backed securities.

In the United States, the primary regulation is provided for in the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of July 2010,

which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). This legislation,

referred to simply as the "Dodd-Frank Act," deals with more issues than

just the regulation of securitizations in the United States. However, we will

focus here only on that part of the Dodd-Frank Act dealing with

securitization. Although Congress passed the act in mid-2010,

implementation of the act's provisions was delegated to various government

agencies: the SEC, the three federal banking agencies (the Federal Reserve

Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC), the

Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and

Urban Development.

The Dodd-Frank Act refers to the entity that does a securitization as the

"securitizer" and defines a securitizer or sponsor of a securitization as "a

person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by

selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through

an affiliate, to the issuer." An ABS is generally defined by the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 to be "a fixed income or other security collateralized

by any type of self-liquidating financial asset (including a loan, lease,

mortgage, or other secured or unsecured receivable) that allows the holder

- f the security to receive payments that depend primarily on cash flow from
the asset."

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt several rules regarding

securitization. These rules deal with

   - reporting standards and disclosure for a securitization transaction in
an ABS prospectus;

  - the representations and warranties required to be provided in
securitization transactions and the mechanisms for enforcing them; and

   - due diligence requirements with respect to the loans underlying the
securitization transactions.

The importance of the last rule should be clear from what we discussed

in the chapter regarding the need for better underwriting standards when

loans are to be distributed through a securitization.

Section 941 of the of the Dodd-Frank Act deals with another key

element to mitigate the risks associated with shoddy underwriting of loans

and receivables included in a securitization. The basic principle underlying

Section 941 is that the issuer should hold enough economic interest in the

securitization transaction so that failure to properly perform due diligence

- n the loans or receivables will have an adverse impact on the securitizer.
This is done by having the securitizer hold a meaningful portion of the bond
classes issued. The rule addressing this issue is referred to as the "risk
retention rule." The rule is designed to ensure that the amount of credit risk
retained by the securitizer would be economically meaningful while at the
same time reducing the potential for the risk retention rule to adversely
affect the availability and cost of credit to consumers and businesses. [7]

The European Parliament and Council proposed regulations in

September 2015 that set forth rules dealing with securitization. In addition,

this entity created a European framework for simple, transparent, and

standardized securitization. There are risk-retention rules under the

proposed EU regulations just as in the United States.

```
Securitization as a Corporate Risk Management Tool

```

In the previous section, we explained why securitization offers the

corporate issuer the potential to reduce funding costs. Moreover, it allows

corporate issuers to diversify their funding sources. As stated by Toyota

Motor Credit Corporation, a captive finance subsidiary of Toyota, in its

filing with the U.S. SEC: "Asset-backed securitization of our earning asset

portfolio provides us with an alternative source of funding." [8]

Beyond the potential funding benefits is another important benefit from

securitization: it can be used as a corporate risk management tool. More

specifically, it can be used to manage (1) interest rate risk, (2) credit risk,

and (3) other risks associated with the collateral.

First let's consider interest rate risk. The loans or receivables backing a

securitization are debt obligations or fixed income instruments.

Consequently, if the loans or receivables remain on the books of the

- riginator, their value declines if interest rates increase. That is, the
- riginator of the portfolio of loans or receivables is exposed to interest rate
risk. However, if that portfolio of loans or receivables is removed from the

- riginator's balance sheet by being used as collateral for a securitization,
the originator no longer is exposed to the interest rate risk associated with
those loans or receivables.

Second, the credit risk associated with the portfolio of loans and

receivables is removed. To understand why, consider once again Ford

Motor Company and its captive finance subsidiary, Ford Motor Credit.

Since 2000, Ford Motor Credit has used securitization to reduce its

portfolio of automobile loans. By doing so, it has reduced its exposure to

the credit risk associated with those loans (i.e., the risk that the borrower

will default). At the end of 2001, Ford Motor Credit carried \$208 million in

auto loans and realized first quarter credit losses of \$912 million. By 2003,

credit losses for the first quarter had declined to \$493 million, with loans on

the balance sheet down by \$28 million to \$180 million.

Third, consider managing the other risks associated with a portfolio of

loans or receivables. Let's look once again at securitization as done in the

automobile industry. As explained later in this chapter, not only are loans

used in a securitization, so also are leases (the asset being lease

receivables). In an automobile lease, the user of the automobile (referred to

as the "lessee") makes payments to the owner of the automobile (called the

"lessor") over the term of the lease. At the end of the lease term, the lessee

has the option either to buy the automobile at a predetermined fixed price or

to return it to the lessor. The market value of the leased automobile at the

end of the lease term is referred to as its "residual value." The lessee's

decision at the end of the lease term depends on the market value of the

automobile compared to the predetermined fixed price set forth in the lease

agreement. If the market value is less than the predetermined fixed price,

the lessee will return to the automobile to the lessor. The lessor therefore

then owns a portfolio of automobiles whose market value is below what

was expected when the leases were originated. This risk in a lease

transaction from the perspective of the lessor or originator is called

"residual risk." This risk is removed when a securitization is created,

because the risk is passed on to the investors in the securitized bonds.

```
Key Points

```

- Asset securitization (or simply, "securitization") plays a critical role in the
financial markets and the real economy.

   - The end result of a securitization is the creation of securities that are

generically referred to as asset-backed securities (ABSs) or bond

classes or tranches that are backed by a pool of loans or receivables.

   - The main parties to a securitization are the seller/originator (the
party seeking to raise funds), a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), and the
servicer.

   - Securitization has resulted in financial disintermediation.
   - The motivation for an entity seeking funds to issue ABSs rather than
a corporate bond is the potential reduction in funding cost.

- The key to the potentially lower funding cost that may arise from a
securitization is the role of the SPV.

- In a securitization, the transaction structure or "waterfall" refers to
the securities created, the rules that set forth the way in which the
losses are to be distributed among the securities in the structure, the
rules for the distribution of interest each month among the securities in
the structure, and the rules for the distribution of principal repayment
among the securities in the structure.

- ABSs are credit enhanced to provide greater protection to bond
classes against defaults.

- In a senior-subordinated structure, the credit support for the senior
bonds is provided by the subordinated bonds.

- The senior bond class will receive a higher credit rating than the
subordinated bond classes.

- The purpose of the senior-subordinated structure is to redistribute the
credit risk associated with the collateral (i.e., pool of receivables); the
redistribution is referred to as "credit tranching."

- The senior-subordinated structure allows investors a choice in the

amount of credit risk they prefer to bear.

- The senior bond class can be tranched further to create bonds with

different maturities, referred to as "time tranching," allowing investors

a choice of maturity.

- Securitization plays a critical role in financial markets in terms of the
three functions that have historically been provided by financial
intermediation: (1) providing maturity intermediation; (2) reducing
risk through diversification; and (3) reducing the costs of transacting
and information processing.

- Securitization is a fundraising vehicle, with funds raised directly in
the public market without the need for a financial intermediary, and
hence results in financial disintermediation.

- The key benefit of securitization to financial markets is that it allows
the creation of tradable securities with better liquidity for financial

claims that would otherwise have remained in the portfolio of financial

intermediaries and therefore would be highly illiquid.

- The two approaches that a bank originating loans can follow are
- riginate to hold and originate to distribute.
- Securitization is the originate-to-distribute approach.
- Securitization raises concerns of moral hazard (i.e., poor
underwriting standards in loan origination) because originators of
loans/receivables are not going to hold those assets on their balance
sheet (i.e., originate to hold) but instead will pool them and distribute
securities backed by the pool of loans to the public.

- The economic incentives to originate as many loans as possible that
can then eventually be securitized without the originator bearing the
credit risk is the major concern about securitization.

- Legislation in the United States has sought to mitigate the moral
hazard problem in the origination of loans associated with
securitization.

- A market for securitized products cannot efficiently develop until a
legal structure is in place that can accommodate securitization.

- Without a provision equivalent to an SPV in a country's trust law,
the benefits of using securitization by an entity seeking to raise funds
are limited.

- The SPV allows decoupling of the credit risk of the entity needing
funds and the bond classes issued through the securitization (where the
SPV is the issuer).

- Regulations dealing with securitization in the United States and the
European Union fall into four categories: increasing disclosure,
requiring risk retention, reforming credit rating agencies, and imposing
capital requirements.

- The abuses and problems associated with securitization identified by
the global financial crisis were addressed in the United States by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of

2010, which required the SEC to adopt several rules regarding

securitization.

   - In addition to the opportunity to raise funds at a lower cost through
securitization, securitization offers corporate issuers the ability to
diversify funding sources and a vehicle for transferring risk (i.e., it is a
corporate risk management tool).

Questions

```

1. How has asset securitization resulted in financial disintermediation?
2. Why is the entity seeking to raise funds through a securitization
referred to as the "seller" or the "originator"?

3. What is a special-purpose vehicle (SPV)?
4. What is meant by the "servicing of loans"?
5. What is meant by the "moral hazard" associated with the
securitization of loans?

6. What is meant by a securitization's "waterfall"?
7. In a securitization structure, explain the following:

a. first-loss piece.

b. senior bonds.

8. What is meant by a "senior-subordinated structure"?
9. A financial corporation with a BBB credit rating has a consumer
loan portfolio. An investment banker suggests that this corporation
consider issuing an ABS where the collateral for the security would the
consumer loan portfolio. What would be the advantage of issuing an
ABS rather than a corporate bond for which the consumer loan
portfolio serves as collateral?

10. In achieving the benefits associated with a securitization, why is
the SPV important to the transaction?

11. What is the difference between credit tranching and time
tranching, and how are they used to create securities that are more
appealing to investors?

12. The following statement appeared in the executive summary of a
report by a global joint initiative:

The securitization and structured credit markets have become critically important to the global capital

markets, and thereby also to the world economies. The absence of well-functioning securitization

markets negatively impacts consumers, banks, issuers and investors, resulting in lower economic

activity and fewer than needed new jobs being created in the future. The price of credit is likely to be

higher for the consumer and the availability scarcer. Banks will no longer have a tool to reduce risk

and diversify their financing sources to free up capital for other activities. Investors will encounter

rising difficulty in gaining exposure to an asset class that has become a significant part of their

portfolios. [9]

a. Explain why "securitization and structured credit markets have become

critically important to the global capital markets, and thereby also to the

world economies."

b. Explain why the "price of credit is likely to be higher for the consumer

and the availability scarcer."

c. Explain why banks "will no longer have a tool to reduce risk and

diversify their financing sources to free up capital for other activities."

13. The following appeared in an International Monetary Fund
working paper by Miguel Segoviano, Bradley Jones, Peter Lindner,
and Johannes Blankenheim:

Securitization, like other forms of financial innovation, has costs and benefits associated with it.

There are conditions under which securitization can be a net benefit for the financial system and vice

versa. As such, securitization as a concept is neither inherently good nor bad per se—a point

underscored by the marked variation in the performance of different classes of securitized assets

during and after the global financial crisis (GFC). This point of departure stands in contrast to some

- f the more polarizing views associated with securitization, which were advanced in the aftermath of
the GFC. [10]

What are the costs associated with securitization that the quotation is

referring to?

14. In the publication cited in the previous question, the following
statement appeared:

The Originate-to-Distribute Model associated with the boom in securitization meant that originators

- ften had little or no economic interest ("skin in the game") in the loans that were written and,
therefore, did not always have a strong incentive to originate loans that borrowers could realistically
repay, as long as there was a buyer for the loans.

What is meant by the "Originate-to-Distribute Model"?

15. When describing the response of European regulators to the
abuses attributable to securitization that caused the financial crisis,
Steven Schwarcz wrote: "To avoid a recurrence of the allegedly flawed

   - riginate-to-distribute model, the originator or sponsor must retain an

unhedged material net economic interest in the securitization of at least

5%." [11] What does this mean?

16. Securitization plays a critical role in financial markets in terms of
the functions that have historically been provided by financial
intermediation. Explain how securitization:

a. provides maturity intermediation.

b. reduces risk through diversification.

c. reduces the costs of transacting and information processing.

17. The following quotation is from Theodor Baums:

The slowest process of all has been the process of establishing the legal framework for securitization

in individual countries. Those countries which have been successful in doing so have found

themselves home to many special purpose vehicles issuing securities backed by assets from their own

and/or foreign countries. Nevertheless for most countries the process has been slow up to now. [12]

Explain what the author is referring to in the above quotation.

In the market for business financing, much of the focus in financial markets

is on the sources for funding publicly traded companies and the

characteristics of the financial instruments that they can use. Yet there is

considerable evidence that growth of a country's real economy is tied to

innovations in its product and service markets. These innovations create

jobs. Often, such innovations result from small and medium-sized

enterprises (SMEs) and startup companies. In many countries, firms

classified as SMEs are a large share of businesses, but a much smaller share

- f the country's GDP. For example, it is estimated that in the European
Union, about 90% of all businesses fall into what would be classified as an
SME. In Japan, about 4.69 million enterprises are classified as SMEs,
representing 99.7% of all enterprises and employing 70% of the workforce.
One of the most successful countries that has transititioned from one the

world's poorest countries to twelveth largest economy in terms of GDP is

the Republic of Korea, where 99.9% of all companies are SMEs,

accounting for 87.7% of all employees. [1]

The specific definition of what an SME is varies from country to

country. Although economists have argued that the link between SMEs and

a country's economic growth is not a simple one (and, in fact, may be a

weak link), governments view SMEs and new ventures as important

components of their econonomy and have instituted laws to support

financing for these business entities. This view about supporting SMEs is

shared by supranationals (such as the World Bank) and central banks.

In this chapter, we describe the markets for financing SMEs and new

ventures as well as the financing instruments used by new ventures.

```
Definition of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises

```

There is no universal definition of what an SME is. The definition is

important, because it may impact the ability of an enterprise to qualify for

access to financing programs in a country and those available from

suprantionals. In a country, it may impact an enterprise's tax status and

regulatory treatment.

The national governments and international organizations establish their

- wn guidelines for defining an SME. Typically this definition is based one
- r more of the following metrics: number of employees, level of sales
(revenue), or total assets. Table 28.1 shows the definition for an SME in
terms of the three metrics for three countries (Australia, Canada, and the
United States), the European Union, and three supranationals (the World
Bank, the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development
Bank, and the African Development Bank). As can be seen, there is

considerable variation in how an SME is defined. Moreover, emerging

countries have even greater variation in their definitions of an SME.

Government Programs and Initiatives

```

It is well known that the financing market available to SMEs is

characterized by market failures and market imperfections. The failure of

the market system to provide funding for SMEs as a result of the global

financial crisis that began in 2008 has highlighted this shortcoming. Market

imperfections in this market has resulted in information asymmetries and

high transaction costs for the small loan size typically sought by SMEs.

These undesirable characteristics of this market leads to a suboptimal

allocation of capital. Recognizing the importance of SMEs and new

ventures to the growth of their economies, governments and regional bodies

have developed policies for making access to financing easier for these

enterprises while also protecting investors. The failure of governments to

intervene to support SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures in the

manufacturing sector, for example, has lead to two adverse impacts. The

first is an underinvestment in research and development (R&D) that can

impede the creation of new jobs and products. The second is that because

SME manufacturers are less likely than larger firms to implement and adopt

new technology and to invest in worker training and education, SME

productivity improvements are slower than they would be with government

support.

A 2011 report by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation

identified and analyzed support programs and practices for SME

manufacturing companies implemented in 11 countries (Argentina,

Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Spain, the

United Kingdom, and the United States). [3] Focusing on the manufacturing

sector, more and more countries have introduced and funded agencies,

programs, and policy instruments supporting SME manufacturers to

enhance their global competitiveness, productivity, and innovation capacity.

According to John Ezell and Robert Atkinson, coauthors of the Information

Technology & Innovation Foundation's study, these government initiatives

seek to

1. Mentor and train SME manufacturers in continuously improving their processes and operational
performance by adopting lean or quality manufacturing principles and new manufacturing process
technologies;

2. Promote the diffusion of new technologies and knowledge from universities, national laboratories,

- r public research institutes to SME manufacturers;

3. Help SME manufacturers innovate new products and services by supporting their R&D and new
product development efforts; or

4. Address gaps in SME manufacturers' access to financing for their R&D and innovation
activities. [4]

The European Union's "Small Business Act" for Europe is its major

policy initiative supporting SMEs, providing a comprehensive framework

to promote entrepreneurship and strengthening the competitiveness of

European SMEs. The act focuses on three areas: (1) improving access to

finance, (2) formulating prudent regulation, and (3) taking advantage of the

single market concept that the European Union seeks to establish. To

improve SME access to finance, the act deals with financial instruments

that can be used to facilitate the raising of venture capital investments and

and provides guarantees for lending to SMEs. Furthermore, the European

Commission established a permanent SME Finance Forum that brings

together representatives of the SME community, banks, and other financial

institutions, including the European Investment Bank. The purpose of the

SME Finance Forum is to tackle the various obstacles faced by SMEs

seeking to obtain credit.

As we discuss the varying funding sources later this chapter, we'll give

examples of government programs, agencies, and initiatives.

```
Stages of Development and Financing for a Business Venture

```

Below we describe the stages of a privately held company in terms of the

milestones achieved, according to the American Institute of Certified Public

Accountants. [5] This categorization of a business venture is important for

understanding the sources of financing available to entrepreneurs.

The American Association of Certified Public Accountants provides the

following six stages of development and financing:

    **Stage 1:** In this stage, the venture is typically characterized as

follows: founders have an idea, but no product revenue has been

generated and possibly product development is in the initial phase.

This stage might be best described as the **pre-commercialization**

**stage**   - r **pre-marketing stage** . In terms of technology, the company is

in **early stage technology** : technology that is not yet commercialized

and has not been proven beyond the drawing board (i.e., nothing

beyond laboratory experiments). In fact, neither the basic research nor

the commercial feasibility may have been completed. Every new hightech product requires an extensive pre-commercialization stage. For

some companies, the legal structure may not have been decided on by

the founders, because no decision may yet have been made to proceed

with the formal formation of a company. Consequently, the founders'

financing needs can vary, based on the costs associated with (1)

conducting of business feasibility studies, (2) building prototypes, (3)

testing and validating the offering, (4) evaluating the market potential,

and (5) filing the legal documents to protect the intellectual property

developed. Financing is **seed capital financing** at the early phase of

this stage and **first round financing**   - r **series A financing** in the late

   - f phase of this stage.

    **Stage 2:** No product revenue but considerable expenses characterize

this stage. Product development has begun, and the founder team is

identifying and managing new business challenges as they arise. It is at

this stage that venture capitalists provide secondor third-round

financing. The founders need further guidance on management

strategies for growing the business, so that in addition to capital, the

new venture needs expertise and relationship building (partnerships)

that can be provided by suppliers of capital, such as venture capitalists.

    **Stage 3:** Typically, the venture is still operating at a loss due to a

lack of revenue generation. But it has made significant advances in

product development, such as the completion of alpha and beta testing

   - f its offering. The venture is further increasing its value by reaching
   - ther key milestones, such as the hiring of a management team.

    **Stage 4:** Although still operating at loss, typically milestones have

been reached regarding the product, and there is customer validation in

the form of first orders and first shipments. As a result, some revenue

has been generated. The new venture can now be viewed as being in

the expansion stage, because the venture now has to expand its

   - perations, hopefully improving its production process, improving its
product, and investing in more costly marketing efforts. The company
has surpassed a sufficient number of key nonfinancial milestones to
consider the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO).

    **Stage 5:** The general level of product revenue allows the venture to

reach key financial milestones, such as break-even operations,

   - perating profitability, or positive cash flows. It is possible for some
type of exit event to occur—possibly an IPO or the sale of the

company.

    **Stage 6:** If an exit event has not occurred by this stage, the company

has a sufficiently strong financial and operational track record to make

it a strong candidate for acquisition.

This general description of the stages of business development and

financing is not carved in stone. No two ventures have the same rate of

growth of revenue and product development. Therefore they have different

capital needs that do not fall neatly into the stages described above. The

conventions characterizing the stages in the literature can vary even among

venture capitalists. For example, suppose that a new venture's founders do

not seek funding for what we described above as seed capital until it has

developed a prototype for its product. A venture capitalist that provides

financing for this new venture might indeed classify this investment as seed

capital; however, another venture capitalist might classify it as early startup

financing. What is important is not the specific nomenclature used but

understanding what types of financing are needed as the business develops.

For purposes of describing the various funding sources available for new

venture financing, prior to the hopeful liquidation of a company resulting

from either an acquisition, a merger, or an IPO, we can simplify those six

stages into two broader stages of financing: early stage financing and

expansion stage financing.

Early stage financing includes Stage 1 of the six stages described above.

In turn, this can be divided into two phases: the seed round and first round.

In the **seed round**, the founders seek to finance the development of a

product or service (i.e., its offerings). Typically, there has not been the

commercialization of the intended offerings, and hence, this stage of

financing is sometimes referred to as the **pre-commercialization financing**

**stage** . In addition to administrative costs, the major costs incurred are for

developing a customer base, developing a prototype of the offering, and

market testing. It may be necessary to hire technical staff, such as

engineers, scientists, and software developers, particularly for high-tech

companies. For investors, this is the stage of a startup that has the greatest

risks and therefore should offer the greatest rewards.

Usually, funding in the very early stages comes primarily through the

use by the founders of whatever cash they can obtain from personal savings,

refinancing a home, using a home as collateral for a second mortgage,

cashing out on a life insurance policy, and from a personal bank loan (as

- pposed to a business bank loan). Some founders will start a business while
still employed by other organizations and use their salaries to help fund the
new business. Using these sources of funding by founders is referred to as
**bootstrap** **financing** . Other sources of funding at this stage may come from
the personal assets of the family members and friends, the prudent use of
credit cards, and the strategic use of vendor financing.

Probably the best-known use of credit card financing was by the

founders of Google. While doctoral students in the computer science

department at Stanford University in the mid-1990s, the founders of

Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, financed the company in its first two

years of operation with the prudent use of credit cards. Carefully watching

spending limits, they used credit cards to purchase used computers and

software. [6] Another example is Charles Huang, the designer of "Guitar Hero

III: Legends of the Rock," who in 2007 used credit cards to finance his

company. [7] Credit card financing is a form of debt financing and has the

risks associated with using debt. The advantage of credit card financing is

the ease with which founders with a good credit rating can obtain multiple

credit cards with generous lines of credit.

The use of suppliers to provide funding for the purchase of equipment,

material needed for production, and services needed for production is

known as vendor financing or trade credit. The benefit to vendors is that

- ffering attractive trade credit terms can stimulate sales, and vendors do
compete on the trade credit terms that they provide. Trade credit works as
follows. Suppose the founders of a company make a purchase from a
vendor. The vendor might give the founders a specified period to make the
payment and if made within the designated period, the founders are
permitted to take a discount from the invoice price. The period in which the
founders are entitled to take the discount is called the "discount period."
Once the discount period passes, the company must pay the full invoice
price. If the discount is not taken, vendor financing becomes another form

- f debt financing, and it, too, comes with a cost, although there is no stated
interest rate. Instead, there is an implicit interest rate that should be
estimated before using this form of debt financing and compared to
alternative forms of financing.

After the above sources are exhausted, management will seek other

sources. **First round financing** is commonly referred to as the **Series A**

**round** - r simply **A financing** . The milestone that has been reached at this

stage is the generation of revenue. Neither break-even operations nor a

profit are typically reached at this stage. Although the risk of first round

investors is still considerable, it is less than that for investors in the seed

round. The most common source of funding at the Series A round is venture

capitalists, which we describe later in this chapter.

In the seed stage, it is difficult for founders to obtain debt financing from

banks in the form of loans except when the founders have sufficient

collateral or assets to provide personal guarantees. Nor has the startup

generated sufficient cash flow to justify a business loan. However, once first

round financing is obtained from venture capitalists, there are specialty

banks and non-bank entities that are willing to provide such loans. These

loans are referred to as **venture debt** and contain an equity kicker for the

lender in the form of warrants.

**Expansion stage financing** includes the last five stages of business
development and financing described above. It is funding for the purpose of
expanding the company's business by expanding production and acquiring
customers based on its marketing strategy. Financing here includes bridge
loans, second round financing (also called Series B round), third round
financing (also called Series C round), and so on. Additional rounds of
financing may be necessary if the company does not have a liquidating
event after several rounds of financing. As explained later in this chapter,
the entry of a new investor group, institutional investors, has allowed
ventures to raise funds via an IPO, which provides substantial funds for a
company to expand without the need to go public.

```
Sources for Seed Stage Financing

```

After the abovementioned sources are exhausted, seed finance can come

from one or more of the following: government-supported funding via

agencies, programs, and initiatives; angel investors, angel groups, and super

angels; and seed accelerators.

```
Government-Supported Funding Programs

```

National governments have recognized the need to support SMEs and new

venture enterprises for the reasons described earlier in this chapter. The

types of government-supported funding programs that have been used by

countries make financing more accessible to SMEs and new ventures are

loan guarantees, direct credit loans, loan subsidies, grant programs, and

preferable tax treatment for lenders to SMEs. In 2008, the World Bank

reported the results of a study on bank financing for SMEs in developed and

developing countires. [8] One focus of the survey, which included 91 banks, is

- n the role of government loan programs. The study found that six of the
seven developed countries and 32 of the 45 developing countries had
government programs to foster financing for SMEs. The study concluded
that guarantee programs are the most common government program used
by developed and developing countries to support SME financing. The

second most popular program in developed programs was interest rate

subsidies. In contrast, for developing countries, the second most common

program was direct credit programs.

**`Types`** **`of`** **`funding`** **`arrangements  Loan`** **`guarantees`** (or **credit**
**guarantees** ) are not direct loans by a government to SMEs. Instead, the
loans are made by private financial institutions with guarantees from the
sponsoring government. The guarantee can cover the entire amount
borrowed or just a specified portion of it. Because the sponsoring
government and the private financial institution share the risk associated
with default by borrowers, such programs are referred to as "risk-sharing"

- r "cost-sharing" programs. This is the SME financing support model used
in the United States and the United Kingdom.

**Direct credit loans** are loans made by the sponsoring government to an
SME. The government is at risk for the entire amount of the loan. Canada's
SME funding program is primarily a direct credit program. There are also
loans with an interest rate subsidy and outright government grant programs.

**Preferable tax treatment** involves a range of tax reliefs provided for
qualified SMEs and new ventures. Tax relief can be in the form of a lower
tax rate for qualifying entities or even a tax holiday (i.e., no tax for a
designated period) and/or a tax credit which is dollar for dollar in the tax
liability. [9] France has a wide range of tax benefits targeting SMEs. Although
many countries provide tax credits for various reasons, France has a
specified R&D tax credit for SMEs. The credit features a full exemption
from the corporate income tax in the first fiscal year. In the United
Kingdom, the Seed and Enterprise Investment Schemes provide tax relief in
different forms to encourage investors to acquire equity in qualifying early
stage companies and small high-risk companies. The United Kingdom's
Small Business Rates Relief also provides tax benefits.

Here we describe the government supported-government supplied by

some countries.

In the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is an

independent agency of the U.S. government created by the Small Business

Act of 1953 with the mission to "aid, counsel, assist and protect the

interests of small business concerns, to preserve free competitive enterprise

and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation." [10] In the

programs available from the SBA, the agency is not the lender. Participating

banks and other lenders make the loans with a large portion the loans

guaranteed by the SBA.

The Japanese have long recognized the importance of SMEs and have

passed legislation and founded agencies aimed at supporting SMEs,

backing their efforts to start new enterprises or open new product markets. [11]

For example, in 1948, the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency was

established. As the Japanese economy grew rapidly in the 1960s, the "SME

Basic Act" was passed in 1963 to deal with disparities between SMEs and

large corporations. The SME Basic Act was revised in 1999 and 2013. [12]

Japan responded by strengthening the financing function of governmentaffiliated financial institutions, including the Japan Finance Corporation for

Small and Medium Enterprise established in 1953, the National Life

Finance Corporation, and the Shoko Chukin Bank.

As noted at the start of this chapter, the Republic of Korea has made an

amazing transition from one of the world's poorest countries with most of

the country's employees working in SMEs. To accomplish economic

growth, the government supported funding for SMEs, increasing that

support during the global financial crisis. The financing framework for

Korea includes (1) the central government via its Small & Medium

Business Corporation, the Korea Finance Corporation, the Credit Guarantee

Fund, and the Korea Technology Credit Guarantee Fund; (2) Bank of

Korea; and (3) local governments. For example, the central government

uses its Small & Medium Business Corporation to make direct and indirect

loans through Korean financial institutions. The local government support

is in the form of credit guarantees and interest rate subsidies.

```
Angel Investors, Angel Groups, and Super Angels

```

After founders have exhausted funding sources from their personal assets

and those of family and friends, and before venture capitalists have stepped

up to provide funding, the primary source of funding early-stage funding is

so-called **angel investors** . In Europe, angels are referred to as "business

angels." The European Business Angel Network defines business angels as

follows:

A business angel is an individual investor (qualified as defined by some national regulations) that

invests directly (or through their personal holding) their own money predominantly in seed or startup

companies with no family relationships. Business angels make their own (final) investment decisions

and are financially independent, i.e., a possible total loss of their business angel investments will not

significantly change the economic situation of their assets. BAs invest with a medium to long term

set time-frame and are ready to provide, on top of their individual investment, follow-up strategic

support to entrepreneurs from investment to exit. [13]

This definition mentions "qualified as defined by national regulations." In

the United States, for example, angel investing is available to individuals

who qualify under the SEC's definition of "accredited investors."

The funding vehicles used are typically convertible securities, which we

describe later in this chapter. In addition to providing funding, angel

investors provide strategic planning advice, assist in team building, and

provide contacts for developing key partnerships and further fundraising.

In the United States, there are approximately 270,000 active angel

investors. [14] According to _Forbes_, individuals who are the the most active

angel investors include Jeff Bezos (founder, president, chief executive

- fficer, and chairman of the board of Amazon.com), Paul Buchheit and Paul
Graham (partners at Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley-based seed
accelerator), Jean-François Clavier (founder and managing partner of
SoftTech VC), and David Lee (founder and managing member at SV Angel,
LLC). It is estimated that in 2012, angel investors invested about \$23
billion in more than 67,000 startup companies, representing nearly 90% of
the outside capital for these ventures. Compared to venture capital firms,
angel investors provided funding for roughly 20 times more startups, even
though venture capital firms invested \$27 billion. [15] Although venture
capitalists are credited with success stories such as Apple, AOL,
Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google, for seed stage financing, these
companies all relied on angel financing.

In Europe, it is estimated that there are about 75,000 business angels as

- f 2010. [16] Business angels are even more important than in the United
States because of the absence of venture capitalists in some European
countries and the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, which has resulted

in less bank lending and venture capital investment. Consequently, in such

countries, business angels are the major source of equity funding for seed

and startup enterprises. Compared to angel investing in the United States,

European business angel investing is still in its infancy. The amount

invested by business angels in the European Union is estimated to be €3–5

billion per year as of 2010 (compared to \$20 billion in the United States)

and in far fewer companies: 2,800 in the European Union compared to

62,000 in the United States. [17]

Since the mid-1990s, angel investors typically have invested through

groups or networks. Some of the groups specialize in particular industries

and may restrict their investments to particular regions of the country.

Angel investors enjoy four benefits from forming an angel group to

collectively evaluate and invest in startups. First, pooling of funds allows

for investing in more startups that, at least in theory, provides for risk

reduction via diversification. Second, the cost of information gathering and

contracting can be shared among members of the group. Third, the diverse

expertise of members of the angel group reduce the risk of not taking into

account key factors that may lead to potentially good ventures being

- verlooked. Finally, the greater name recognition of a group of wealthy
individuals, as opposed to a single individual, is likely to result in more
deals being made. From an angel investor's perspective, a disadvantage of
participating in (i.e., becoming a member of) an angel group is the time
commitment required. Members must attend events, particularly
participation in the screening of deals.

The Angel Capital Association, a trade association that supports the

American professional angel community, publishes an annual report on the

state of the industry. The report is titled the _Halo Report._ According to the

2017 _Halo Report_, 63% of angel group deals were concentrated in three

sectors: software (27%), consumer products and services (21%), and

healthcare (15%). While in prior years internet and mobile companies

dominated the deals, in 2017 these two sectors dropped from 11.2% to

4.48% of the deals. [18] In addition, this issue of the _Halo Report_ states that

the median round size was \$270,000 with an average size of \$637,000.

According to the report, the five largest angel groups in 2017 are Keiretsu

Forum, Houston Angel Network, Y Combinations, Central Texas Angel

Network, and New York Angels. .

Although venture capitalists invest primarily in first round financing,

some venture capital firms do provide seed financing. These firms, referred

to as **super angels**, are set up as private equity firms. (A description of

private equity firms is provided when we describe venture capital firms

later in this chapter.) They differ from traditional venture capital firms in

that the amount that can be raised from super angels is less.

One study investigated the role of funding for high-growth startup firms

by angel investors in terms of the growth, survival, and access to follow-up

funding. [19] The four key findings of the study are:

1. The success of a startup is highly correlated to the level of interest
that angel investors exhibit during the initial presentation and by the
follow-up due diligence performed by angel investors.

2. Startups are more likely to survive at least four years if they have
angel funding.

3. Startups are more likely to raise follow-up funding outside the
angel group if they obtain funding from angel investors

4. Startup performance and growth is more likely to improve if the
startup obtains angel investor funding.

Moreover, the study finds that it may not be access to capital per se that

angel groups provide entrepreneurs of startup firms. Instead, it may be the

benefits of advising and furnishing business contacts that are of greatest

value.

There is disagreement as to whether angel investors earn attractive

returns from the ventures in which they invest. [20] As Robert Wiltbank of

Willamette University observes:

The investing world seemed certain that angel investors were rubes. Conventional wisdom dictated

that they made reckless investments in very early-stage ventures mostly doomed to fail. And

whenever they might come close to succeeding, savvy "professional" investors would just swoop in,

cram them down, and win the real returns. In addition, angels were up against a selection problem:

All the best entrepreneurs and opportunities would naturally gravitate to the best venture capital

funds, leaving only the "scraps" for angel investors. [21]

Wiltbank and Boeker studied the returns to angel investments that were

completed by 2007 using the most comprehensive data available. [22] Their

findings for returns on group-affiliated angel investments were as follows:

   - The average was 2.6 times the return on investment after 3.5 years.
   - Almost 48% of the returns on exited investments provided a return
that was more than the amount invested by the angel group, or
equivalently, 52% resulted in a loss.

   - There were returns of more than 10 times the amount invested for

7% of the exited investments.

The above findings are the returns for individual ventures. When

looking at angel investor portfolios, they find that only 39% of the

portfolios realized a loss (in contrast to 52% of individual investments).

Overall findings appear to be comparable to those of venture capitalists that

we describe later in this chapter.

Instead of studying actual returns on angel investments, in a study

sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, DeGennaro and Dwyer

investigate the expected returns that drive investments. [23] For their sample of

588 angel investments during 1972–2007, which contains 419 investments

that were completed by the end of 2007 (i.e., exited investments), [24] they

found that angel investors can expect to earn net returns of 70% in excess of

the risk-free rate of return available in the market for an average holding

period of 3.67 years. This is roughly the same profile that has been found

for venture capitalists. [25]

```
Equity Crowdfunding Platforms

```

**Crowdfunding** is the practice of raising funds for a startup from a large
number of investors who invest small sums. Typically, the funds are raised
via the Internet. There are two types of crowdfunding: reward (donation)
crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding. [26] Our focus here is on **equity**
**crowdfunding**, which allows investors to obtain an equity interest in a

startup company.

Any startup that is interested in raising equity capital has to comply with

its home country's securities regulations. In the United States, for example,

startup companies must comply with the general solicitation and advertising

as set forth by the SEC. Prior to April 5, 2012, equity crowdfunding was not

allowed in the United States. However, provisions in the Jumpstart Our

Business Starts Act (JOBS Act) made possible the soliciting of funds by

startups, allowing for equity crowdfunding. Since that time, numerous

equity crowdfunding platforms have been started.

```
Seed Accelerators

```

Seed accelerators provide a vehicle for founders to launch a company in a

high-tech industry. They do so by providing seed stage financing in

exchange for a small equity stake in the startup. The amount of funding

available from accelerators ranges from $20,000 to $100,000 in exchange

for 2–10% equity in the company. Funding is in the form of a convertible

note, the same instrument used by angel investors and described later in this

chapter.

What is key for founders who are considering seed accelerators is the

- pportunity to gain access not only to needed funding but also to other
potential investors, training in a short period of time, temporary office
space, and access to a team of experts. By providing mentoring for
founders, seed accelerators prepare founders to present their ideas for a
product or service to potential venture capitalists. At the conclusion of the
program (i.e., on graduation from the program), there is a "demo day,"
where founders can make presentations to potential investors and the press.

```
Expansion Financing

```

Until about 2010, the primary sources for expansion financing have been

traditional venture capital firms, corporate venture capital firms, and online

venture capital funds. The most recent entrants providing financing for

startup companies in the very late stages are institutional investors, such as

mutual funds and closed-end investment companies.

```
Venture Capitalists

```

According to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture

capital firms are "professional, institutional managers of risk capital that

enables and supports the most innovative and promising companies." [27] The

funds invested in a startup business are in the form of equity. The

investments are typically made in a series or in rounds that typically occur

every two years, based on predetermined milestones being reached by the

startup company. The equity investments are typically highly illiquid and

have little value until the company matures, which is expected to take from

five to eight years after the company is launched.

Because venture capital firms typically take equity positions in private

companies, how do they differ from private equity firms that invest in

private companies? Venture capital firms are often said to be a special type

- f private equity firm that invests in startup companies. [28] In contrast, the
typical private equity firm invests in mature companies that are seeking to
go private or are considered to be underperforming and have the potential
for highly attractive returns. One important difference in how returns are
generated between the investments made by venture capital firms and
private equity firms is the use of leverage by the latter.

In 2015, capital venture investments were approximately \$59.1 billion,

used to finance the following stages as categorized by the NVCA: seeding

stage, 2%; early stage, 34%, late stage, 27%, and expansion stage, 37%. Of

the \$59.1 billion, \$42.1 was invested in 2,620 information technology

companies, \$10.9 billion in 664 medical/health/life science companies, and

the balance, \$6.1 billion, in 420 non-high-tech companies. Of the nine

industry sectors in which investments were made by venture capital firms in

2015, half were to just two industry sectors: the software sector (40%) and

biotechnology sector (13%). [29]

According to the NVCA, usually only 10% of the business plans

submitted to a venture capital firm for funding are given serious

consideration, and only 1% of the submitted business plans are eventually

funded.

Because of the long-term investment in a startup company, the partners

- f a venture capital firm actively engage in various aspects of the company
in which they invest. At a minimum, this takes the form of participation in
corporate governance by obtaining one or more seats on the board of
directors.

The process for creating a portfolio of ventures by a venture capital firm

is as follows. This portfolio of ventures is referred to as the "VC fund."

Typically, a limited partnership is formed by the venture capital firm. A

limited partnership has general partners and limited partners. The former

manage the investment portfolio of ventures and have unlimited liability,

whereas the latter do not participate in the selection of ventures to include

in the investment portfolio and have limited liability. For a VC fund, the

venture capital firm is the general partner, and the limited partners are the

- utside investors from whom the venture capital firm obtains commitments
to invest in the fund. Thus, an investor does not invest in the capital venture
firm or an individual venture but rather in a particular VC fund (i.e.,
portfolio of ventures).

The investors in the VC funds created by venture capital firms are

institutional investors, family offices, and high net worth individuals.

Institutional investors include pension funds, insurance companies,

endowments, and foundations. Family offices are entities that manage the

financial and personal affairs of a wealthy family.

A VC fund is created when the venture capital firm obtains sufficient

commitments from investors. As investors provide cash to the venture

capital firm, the VC fund's general partners make the investments in

ventures that are identified by the firm's analysts. Because there are

multiple rounds of financing, a certain amount of reserves are set aside for

those future rounds. The VC fund's return is realized when the venture

either goes public via an IPO, is acquired by another company, or merges

with another company.

An article published in the _Harvard Business Review_, [30] by Diane

Mulcathy, a former venture capitalist and a director of private equity for the

Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, [31] explains myths that she believes

exist about venture capitalists. Her motivation for busting the six myths is

"to help company founders develop a more realistic sense of the industry

and what it offers." Mulcathy's six myths are:

   - Myth 1: The primary source of funding for startup companies is
venture capitalists.

   - Myth 2: A venture capitalist takes a big risk when investing in a

startup.

   - Myth 3: Valuable advice and mentoring is provided by most venture
capitalists.

  - Myth 4: The returns generated by venture capital firms are
spectacular.

   - Myth 5: The larger the venture capital fund, the better.
   - Myth 6: Venture capitalists are innovators.

In disputing Myth 1, Mulcathy notes that (1) venture capital funds have

provided capital for less than 1% of U.S. companies and (2) in contrast to

angel investors, whose numbers are growing, the venture capital industry is

contracting. Myth 2 is clear: it is the investor in VC funds who takes on the

risks associated with investing in startups, not the venture capital firm that

is the general partner of a VC fund. Not all venture capital firms commit the

same amount of time to advising and mentoring a startup company (Myth

3). Thus, founders must perform due diligence when selecting a venture

capital firm so that the anticipated involvement sought will be provided by

the firm selected. As for Myth 4 regarding the return performance, we will

discuss that below. Suffice it to say here that the empirical evidence does

not support the view that VC funds have generated anything near

spectacular returns. Empirical evidence also fails to support the view that

the larger the VC fund, the better (Myth 5). In particular, the evidence

shows that as a VC fund's size increases above \$250 million, performance

declines. Finally, although venture capitalists may provide funding for

founders with innovative ideas that need to be commercialized,

management of venture capital firms has not been innovative over the past

two decades, according to Mulcathy (Myth 6). She concludes by saying that

although venture capitalists will play a significant role in funding startups in

the future, it will be less than in the past, because the venture capital

industry is contracting as new funding sources become available.

```
Corporate Venture Capitalists

```

Corporate venture capitalists are corporations that invest in startups that

have the potential for providing a good strategic fit to their company's

- fferings. Although we have described VC funds as sources for first round
financing, they are also involved in the seed phases of early stage financing.

Examples of corporate venture funds include Dell Venture, Google

Ventures, Cisco Investments, Lilly Ventures, Johnson & Johnson

Development Corporation, Microsoft Ventures, Intel Capital, and Samsung

Ventures. A benefit of obtaining funding from corporate venture capitalists

is that they provide the founders with access to corporate distribution

channels and infrastructure, as well as to potential strategic partners.

Corporate venture funds were an important source of startup funding

during the first half of 2011, a time when traditional venture capital firms

were finding it difficult to raise investment funds because of the global

financial crisis. At that time, corporate venture funds provided 11% of

venture capital financing. [32] According to the _Corporate Venture Capital_

_Report_, in the third quarter of 2013, investments by corporate venture funds

reached its highest level since 2011 with \$2.1 billion spread over 140

investments. Corporate venture funds accounted for 30% of all venture

capital financing. The dollar investment that is available from corporate

venture funds is greater than that provided by traditional venture capital

firms.

The potential benefits to the corporate venture fund's parent company

are threefold. [33] First, it may help the parent company respond to

technological changes faster than traditional R&D programs. Josh Lerner of

the Harvard Business School cites Lilly Ventures as an example of one such

corporate venture fund that helped its parent company, the pharmaceutical

company Eli Lilly, to "catch up with the rapid advances in bioscience that

were threatening to render their chemistry-based expertise irrelevant." [34]

Second, potentially attractive financial returns can be realized. Finally, a

corporate venture fund has the potential to provide a boost to the parent

company's product or services as a result of technological spillover.

Empirical evidence reported by Hyunsung Daniel Kang and Vikram

Nanda based on an analysis of technological and financial returns generated

by investments by 796 corporate venture funds in the bio-pharmaceutical

industry between 1985 and 2006 support this third benefit. They find that

the technological advances attributable to investments made by corporate

venture funds did increase the parent corporation's value. However, in

contrast to the positive spillover effect generated by technology on

corporate value, they found that financial returns had a negligible effect. [35]

```
Online Venture Capital Funds

```

In May 2012, a platform was launched by FundersClub that allows

accredited investors to become equity holders in startup ventures by

selecting ventures online. [36] At the time of launch, FundersClub had 5,000

members (i.e., accredited investors). It offers two types of funds to its

members: single-company funds and multicompany funds that are managed

by FundersClub. For a single-company fund, the member selects from a

prescreened list of startup companies whose investment profile is provided.

In contrast, for a multicompany funds, an investor is investing in a portfolio

- f yet to be determined startup companies, where the companies to be
selected are based on an investment strategy formulated and then executed
by the FundersClub investment committee. [37]

Although at the time of launch, 500 of the 5,000 members of

FundersClub invested approximately \$2.5 million in nine different funds,

the investment made by investors typically ranges from $2,500 to $250,000.

The startup companies available to invest in, which are early, mid-, and late

stage private U.S. technology companies, are prescreened by the

FundersClub Investment Committee and FundersClub Panel each week.

The startup companies that are screened typically are identified from

FundersClub network and partners. According to FundersClub, less than

5% of the ventures vetted are selected to be listed on its website for

members to review. Using a web platform, members can browse the

prescreened startup companies, review their investment profiles (which

include a pitch video by the founders), and sign the legal documents.

Members also have the opportunity to query a startup company's founder

via a moderated question and answer forum. To keep investors up to date

after they invest in a startup company, as well as to potentially get them

further involved, the startup company will identify on its profile the manner

in which it will communicate with its investors. Several methods of

communication are available, such as quarterly email updates or inclusion

- n an "insider investor distribution list" to inform investors of significant
milestones, developments that have been achieved, and video messages
from the startup company's founders.

The FundersClub platform might seem like crowdfunding as described

earlier in this chapter. However, it is not crowdfunding, because investors in

crowdfunding each invest a sum in one company on an individual basis.

Instead, FundersClub pools the amount invested by individuals and then

creates a VC fund to either invest in a single startup company or a portfolio

- f startup companies. Hence, this investment approach is no different than
what traditional venture capitalists do when creating VC funds and can be
correctly described as an "on-line VC fund." To avoid potential conflicts of
interest in the selection of startups included in one of the funds,
FundersClub does not charge startup companies to be included on its
platform.

```
Institutional Investors: Mutual Funds and Hedge Funds

```

The latest entrants providing expansion financing for new ventures prior to

an IPO, acquisition, or merger are institutional investors. These investors

include mutual funds and hedge funds.

Like VC funds, these institutional investors are collective investment

vehicles. Investors in these collective investment vehicles own a pro rata

share of the fund's portfolio. Several of the sponsors of mutual fund

families, such as BlackRock Financial Management, Fidelity Investments,

T. Rowe Price, Janus Capital Group, and Wellington Management, have

invested in startup technology companies for certain of their funds.

According to _CB Insight_, mutual funds and hedge funds invested in \$628

million in 11 startup technology companies in 2010. In the following three

years, they invested in more than 31 deals.

Because investments in startup companies are referred to as "alternative

investments," mutual funds that invest a significant portion of the fund's

assets in startup companies are referred to as a "alternative" or "alt" mutual

funds. For example, consider New Horizons Fund Inc. According to the

fund's prospectus, the fund pursues an "aggressive stock fund seeking longterm capital growth primarily through investments in small, rapidly

growing companies." The fund is permitted to invest in privately held

companies. This fund's 2013 annual report indicated that early-stage

companies accounted for about a third of the portfolio's holdings. An

example of this fund's holdings in a startup company is its 2009 investment

in Twitter.

An example of mutual fund participation in a startup company is Apptio.

Founded in 2007, Apptio develops on-demand, cloud-based business

software applications. The company's Series A financing of \$7 million was

- btained in the summer of 2007 from two venture capital firms and an angel
investor. Following two additional rounds of financing, by May 2012,
Apptio's existing investors included four venture capital firms. In May
2012, Apptio obtained its fourth round of financing (Series D financing) of
\$50 million from not only its existing venture capital firms but also from T.
Rowe Price, which acquired shares for several of the mutual funds it
sponsors. One year later in May 2013, Apptio investors added to its existing
investors another mutual fund, Janus Capital, as well as another unnamed
institutional investor, in a \$45 million Series E round financing.

Late-stage expansion financing rounds prior to an IPO typically have not

involved the megadeals or rounds that are now possible from institutional

investors, involving amounts that can run into hundreds of millions of

dollars. The advantage to the founding teams of a high-tech startup

companies is that they can postpone going public (i.e., IPOs), so that they

can come to the public market with a better track record regarding growth

and brand name. The motivation for these institutional investors is to get in

- n pre-IPO valuation. For example, in the first quarter of 2014, Airbnb Inc.
was said to have raised about \$450 million when institutional investors

participated. To put this amount in perspective, with the exception of the

Twitter IPO, no technology startup company has raised more than that

amount when it went public.

```
Initial Public Offering

```

As the need for financing increases as the company grows, the founders

turn to the general public to meet their needs. Public funding is obtained via

an IPO. It has long been viewed that an IPO is the holy grail of exit

strategies. But not all founders have as their exit plan strategy an IPO. For

some founders, an IPO is a necessary evil to obtain adequate funding that

was unavailable from traditional sources (which include angel and venture

capital financing). However, as explained above, new players in the market

- institutional investors—have made the need to rush to an IPO

unnecessary for some firms. Instititutional investors could provide a large

injection of funds to allow founders to expand without the need of public

funding and, as a result, some companies have delayed going public by

several years.

The decision to go public begins with discussions with the company's

financial advisor to determine whether the company is a suitable candidate

to go public and whether market conditions are right for an IPO. Financial

advisors know what investors will consider when acquiring the shares in an

IPO. For example, in some industries, a company may be able to go public

- nly by exhibiting a long history of strong financial performance, including
revenue and earnings growth. (However, a short history of performance
may be acceptable for going public for a companies in certain high-tech
industries.) In addition, the founders must determine the trading location for
their shares (i.e., an exchange or OTC market). In the case of a company
whose stock is listed on an exchange, there are listing requirements that the
exchange specifies. With respect to timing, market conditions may be such
that IPOs coming to market face low a stock valuation. Such unfavorable
conditions would encourage a postponement of an IPO until market
conditions improve.

**`Advantages of going public`** There are two principal advantages of a
company going public. First, publicly traded common stock provides
liquidity for the shares owned by founders as well as investors and
employees who are shareholders. For some founders who desire to harvest

- r cash out on the value that they created by building the company, an IPO
is allows them to do so.

Second, founders can use shares as a form of currency, allowing them to

make acquisitions needed to expand their business as well as to attract key

executives by offering stock options. The shares are a form of currency

because they have a market price, making it unnecessary in transactions

involving an acquisition or the hiring of a key officer to negotiate the value

- f the shares that are used in an exchange. Management of targeted
companies that founders seek to acquire and key officers the founders seek
to attract have a clearly defined idea of what is being offered by looking at
the market value of the shares.

Two other alleged advantages are cited for going public. The first is that

publicly traded companies have greater access to alternative financing

sources, such as bank loans and bond financing. The second is that a

publicly traded company is viewed as more prestigious than a private

company, providing greater exposure of its offerings to the public and

suppliers, as well as greater exposure to the public investing community.

**`Disadvantages of going public`** Some factors make going public less
appealing to founders. First, a publicly traded company must comply with
the regulatory requirements for reporting companies. For example, in the
United States, SEC regulatory requirements result in the occurrence of

- ngoing costs beyond the initial costs (legal, accounting, and banker fees)
associated with an IPO, as well as listing fees charged by an exchange if
that is the trading venue selected. The costs of being a public company have
increased in the United States as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002. Second, there are implicit costs that involve the time spent by
founders preparing the information that a reporting company must provide

- n a periodic basis to public investors.

Another concern is the potential loss of confidentiality, a third

disadvantage for some companies of taking a private company public. In

the United States, a reporting company in its prospectus in its IPO and in its

Form 10-K is required to disclose information that founders might view as

highly sensitive to it operations or business strategy. The information that is

not required from private companies but is from public ones includes

information about products, customers, R&D, and management strategies.

The potential loss of control and flexibility when making business

decisions as a result of going public is a fourth disadvantage of going

public. When the founders lose controlling interest, major decisions (and

even minor ones) may necessitate shareholder approval that require costly

proxy voting as well as a considerable time delay while approval is sought

from shareholders. The board of directors may no longer be controlled by

the founders but by major shareholder groups if more than a majority of the

shares are sold to the public. Of course, common stock with limited voting

rights can be sold, but this may make the common stock less appealing to

investors, resulting in a lower share valuation. Moreover, not all founders

will be in a position to issue shares with limited voting rights.

Finally, founders who remain with the company after the IPO will

experience pressure to perform as expected by shareholders and the

financial community to achieve targeted financial metrics, such as earnings

per share and earnings growth per share. This often results in the shifting of

focus of founders from building a stronger company to achieving short-term

financial targets at the expense of long-term performance.

```
Equity Dilutive Securities Used for New Ventures

```

The financial instruments that can be issued to raise funds are classified as

either equity or debt. For most publicly traded nonfinancial corporations,

equity is the larger component of the capital structure. For startup

companies, equity (or equity-type debt) is typically an even larger

component of the capital structure—particularly in the early stages of

financing—than it is for publicly traded nonfinancial corporations. This

decision about its capital structure (i.e., how much should be financed by

equity versus debt) is typically forced on the founders because of the

limited sources of pure debt financing available. By "pure debt" financing

refers to debt where the creditors are not entitled to convert the debt for

equity. As a startup enters into its later stages, there are opportunities to

issue pure debt.

Here we review the issuance of securities in the United States by new

ventures that lead to the issuance of common stock, referred to as **equity**

**dilutive securities** . These securities include convertible preferred stock and

convertible debt. Most investors in a startup company prefer equity dilutive

securities to common stock for the reasons described in this chapter.

When common stock shares or equity dilutive securities are issued to

- btain financing, the founders are concerned about the impact on ownership
and control of the company. With respect to ownership, founders will look
at how their ownership percentage changes following a round of financing.
Control means the flexibility afforded the founders when managing the
company in terms of strategic planning and directing the future of the

company.

Many startup companies have been moving away from the "one share,

- ne vote" common structure and toward a dual-class stock structure, where
each class of stock has different voting rights. The motivation for creating
different classes with different voting rights is that it allows the company's
founders to retain control of the company by controlling the class of
common stock with the largest number of voting rights. Typically in a dualclass structure, the two classes of common stock are referred to as "Class A
stock" and "Class B stock." One cannot simply tell which class has the
larger number of voting rights from the label. That is, there is no industry
rule stating A or B will have the larger number of voting rights.

Historically, founding members of companies have been able to

maintain control by owning less than a majority of the shares but by

controlling the voting shares. For example, Rupert Murdock, CEO of News

Corp., owns less than 1% of the nonvoting stock (which is traded in the

market) but controls 40% of the voting stock. In 2004, Google adopted a

dual-class structure—Class A and Class B common stock. Each share of

Class A common stock has one vote per share, whereas Class B has 10

votes per share. The two founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as well as

the then-CEO, held the Class B shares. When Google went public, its Class

A shares were sold via a Dutch auction. The dual-class structure gave the

founders and CEO control over two-thirds of the voting shares. Facebook

has a dual class structure with the same number of votes as Google for its

Class A and Class B stock. The CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg,

- wned shares of Class B stock that allowed the retention of control after the

Class A stock was sold via its IPO in 2012. [38]

Convertible Preferred Stock

```

Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines the features of common

stock and a debt obligation (such as a bond). Despite its debt-like feature, it

is considered a form of equity security and on the balance sheet appears as

part of stockholders' equity. Unlike common stockholders, preferred

stockholders typically do not have voting rights except under certain

circumstances described later. In the early stages of a startup company,

preferred stock that allows for such investors as angel investors and venture

capitalists to convert the preferred stock into common stock is the vehicle

- f choice for investors who seek to benefit from the price appreciation
potential for the common stock.

Preferred stock comes with provisions that convey rights, preferences,

and privileges to the investors. The holders of a company's preferred stock

have a claim on the dividends declared by the corporation's board of

directors, and this claim is senior to that of the holders of the company's

common stock. Preferred stock has a par value and a dividend rate.

However, as with common stock issued by a startup company, investors in

preferred stock are typically not paid a dividend due to the need to conserve

cash.

We now describe the different features of preferred stock.

**`Dividends`** The par value together with the preferred stock dividend rate
determines the dollar amount of the dividends that would be paid if there
are sufficient earnings to pay preferred stockholders. For example, suppose
that a company's preferred stock has a par value of \$100 per share and a
dividend rate of 6%. Multiplying the par value of \$100 by the 6% dividend
rate gives the annual dividend amount (\$6 in our example) that the
company agrees to pay its preferred stockholders.

A company is under no legal obligation to pay preferred stockholders

any dividends. However, in such instances, there is typically a provision

that imposes restrictions on management when dividends have not been

paid. One such provision conveys preferred stockholders voting rights to

elect some members to the issuer's board of directors. This feature is called

"contingent voting rights," because the voting rights are contingent on a

missed dividend payment. Despite this adverse impact, the legal

consequences for failing to make a preferred stock dividend payment are

not as dire as when a company fails to pay creditors the interest payment

due to them. In that case, the company is legally obligated to repay the

principal immediately (i.e., pay off the debt obligation), and failure to do so

may result in bankruptcy.

If there is a shortfall in the quarterly dividend payment to preferred

stockholders, is the company required to make up the shortfall in future

quarters? The answer depends on how this situation is provided for in the

preferred stock agreement. Preferred stock can be either cumulative or

noncumulative preferred stock. For cumulative preferred stock, the

dividend payment accrues until it is fully paid, and therefore common

stockholders cannot receive any dividends until that is done. In the case of

noncumulative preferred stock, any shortfall in a quarterly dividend

payment is lost. As noted earlier, dividends are typically not paid by

startups. Consequently, preferred stock issued by a startup company

typically will be cumulative preferred stock, where the unpaid dividends

will be added to the preferred stock's par value.

**`Liquidation preferences`** During a liquidating event, the par value is the
amount that the holder is entitled to receive before common stockholders

can receive any amount of the liquidation proceeds. Typically, a liquidating

event is defined broadly in the agreement. It is not limited to the actual

liquidation of the company as a result of bankruptcy or dissolution. Instead,

it will typically include the sale of the company and a change of control. In

practice, startups often will not have much in proceeds if there is a

liquidation event that results in the bankruptcy of the company.

The preference granted to preferred stockholders in the case of a

liquidating event is considered to be this type of security's key provision, as

well as impacting subsequent rounds of financing. To illustrate the

importance of the preference granted, let's consider the case of a liquidating

event where a company is sold for \$22 million (after all costs associated

with the sale) and assume the following for the pre-sale capital structure:

par value of preferred stock of \$5 million and debt of \$2 million. Once

creditors are paid their \$2 million, the amount available to all equity

investors (preferred stockholders and common stockholders) is \$20 million.

Now the question is how the \$20 million is allocated between the preferred

stockholders and common stockholders. If the preferred stockholders are

not permitted to participate in any proceeds above the amount of their par

value when there is a liquidation event, then the preferred stock is said to be

“nonparticipating preferred stock” (or “1× liquidation preference”). [39] In our

illustration, the distribution of proceeds resulting from the sale would be as

follows: \$5 million to preferred stockholders and \$15 million to common

stockholders.

Founders seek to negotiate terms such that the preferred stock is

nonparticipating. In contrast, preferred stockholders in new ventures will

seek to participate in the liquidation proceeds beyond the par value of the

preferred stock. If preferred stockholders are entitled to share along with

common stockholders any remaining liquidation proceeds, then the

preferred stock is said to be "participating preferred stock." Preferred stock

that conveys a participating right can have different forms of participation,

defined in terms of a multiple of the preferred stock's par value. For

example, if preferred stockholders are entitled to receive twice or triple

their par value (referred to as "2× liquidation preference" and "3×

liquidation preference," respectively), then the distribution would be as

follows:

Distribution to 2× liquidation

preference

Distribution to 2× liquidation 3× liquidation

preference preference

Preferred \$10 million \$15 million

stockholders:

\$10 million \$15 million

Common

stockholders:

\$10 million \$5 million

A hybrid of the two types of preferred stock just described is one in

which participation takes place, but it is capped at a specified amount. This

form of preferred stock is referred to as **capped participating preferred**

**stock** - r
**partially participating preferred stock** . For example, in our

previous illustration, suppose that the preferred stockholders are entitled to

share equally in liquidation proceeds up to \$8 million. Then the preferred

stockholders would receive \$8 million, and the common stockholders

would receive the balance of \$12 million.

**`Conversion provision`** The optional conversion feature in a preferred
stock offering often granted to investors in a startup company typically
grants the investor the right to convert to the company's common shares.
Restrictions may be imposed on when the conversion must occur. Typically,
conversion is mandatory if certain events occur, such as an IPO. There are
provisions to protect investors against dilution of their potential equity
position.

```
Convertible Note

```

A **convertible note** is typically issued to investors in the early stages of

financing of a startup prior to a first ("Series A") round of financing. Unlike

convertible preferred stock, which is a form of equity, a convertible note is

a form of debt. The holder of the convertible note either has the option to

exchange the note for an equity position or automatically has the position

converted into an equity position if there is a Series A round of financing.

The equity position received by the holder of a convertible note is typically

preferred stock.

**`Conversion terms`** Let's first look at a traditional convertible note issued

by a mature corporation. The traditional convertible note gives the investor

the right to convert into the issuer's common stock. The number of common

stock shares into which the convertible note can be converted is called the

"conversion ratio." Typically, the conversion ratio is fixed over the life of

the convertible note. If the par value of the convertible note is \$1,000 and

the conversion ratio is 20:1, then the investor is entitled to convert the note

into 20 shares of common stock. Effectively the price that the investor

would be paying for each share of common stock by exercising the

conversion privilege (i.e., the “conversion price”) is \$50 per share.

When used for seed financing by a startup, the conversion note differs in

two ways. First, the conversion is typically into preferred stock and not

common stock as in the case of a traditional convertible note. Moreover, the

preferred stock is convertible preferred stock. So the exercise of the

conversion privilege gives the investor the right to convert into a security

that, in turn, has the right to eventually convert into common stock. Because

a convertible debt can ultimately result in the issuance of more common

stock, it is a form of an equity dilutive security.

The second difference is the price paid for the preferred stock when

conversion occurs. The price that an investor will have to pay for the

preferred stock shares if conversion occurs is based on a provision set forth

in the convertible note offering. There could be a conversion discount or a

conversion valuation cap. As explained below, both these provisions are

included for the benefit of convertible note investors to compensate them

for the substantial risks that they accepted by being early investors.

**`Conversion discount`** Early investors in a startup who purchase the
convertible note do so in anticipation of generating an attractive return, if
the startup performs well and its common stock price increases.
Consequently, there must be provisions in the convertible note offering that
allow investors to be compensated for accepting this risk exposure at the
early stages of the startup. In addition, that reward should be potentially
greater than that given to investors who invest in later financing rounds of
the startup. In other words, when later investors (such as venture capitalists)
make a determination of the value of the startup to purchase the shares of
the preferred stock, investors in the convertible note want to be able to
purchase the preferred shares at a lower price, because they were the initial
bearers of the high risks associated with a startup company.

The provision that allows convertible note investors to do just that is the

conversion discount, which specifies the discount at which convertible note

investors can buy the preferred stock shares below what Series A investors

pay for their preferred stock shares. Here is an example of how it works,

assuming a 25% conversion discount.

Suppose that the convertible note funding is \$300,000 with an interest

rate of 10%. Two years later, there is a Series A financing by a venture

capital fund, where the terms obtained are such that preferred stock could

be purchased for \$1 per share. The 25% conversion discount means that the

convertible note investors would pay \$0.75 per share of preferred stock

(this is what we referred to earlier as the conversion price). How many

shares of preferred stock would the convertible note investors receive?

Because the convertible note investor is entitled to convert both the par

value (\$300,000) plus the accrued interest (\$60,000), the amount converted

is based on \$360,000. Because the convertible note’s amount to be

converted is \$360,000 and each preferred share can be purchased for \$0.75

per share, the number of preferred shares would be 480,000 shares

($360,000/$0.75).

The conversion discount need not be fixed over the life of the security.

Instead it can be structured so that it increases over time until Series A

financing is obtained. One might expect that the longer it takes to obtain

Series A financing, the greater will be the risk exposure of the convertible

note investor and therefore a higher conversion discount is warranted. This

is also an incentive for the founders to seek Series A financing as soon as

reasonably possible to avoid further dilution.

A startup company may not necessarily raise all funds via convertible

notes at one time. There may be several issues of convertible notes offered

at different times. The conversion discount can be different for each

- ffering, depending on what is needed to attract investors at the time of
each offering. For example, a conversion discount may be higher for very
early investors interested in purchasing convertible notes than for later
investors in convertible notes.

Unlike a traditional convertible note, where the investors benefit from a

rise in the value of the company, although investors in a startup's

convertible note also benefit from an increase in valuation, investors do not

want to see it rise that much by the Series A round of financing. The higher

the valuation placed by the Series A investors is, the fewer shares of

preferred stock will be received.

**`Conversion valuation cap`** A conversion valuation cap is the maximum
dollar amount that can be used for determining the conversion price that the
holder of the convertible note has to pay for the right to convert into

preferred stock. The reason that this provision benefits the investor is that a

lower price can be paid for the preferred stock than Series A investors pay.

To illustrate, suppose that an investor owns \$300,000 par value of a

convertible note with a conversion valuation cap of \$6 million, and the

company is raising funds in a Series A financing. Suppose further that the

pre-money valuation (recall that this is the valuation before angel financing)

is \$8 million in this financing for preferred stock with a par value of \$1. At

the time of financing, assume that the accrued interest for the convertible

note is \$60,000. The conversion valuation cap of \$6 million means that the

conversion price for the convertible noteholders to purchase the preferred

stock is adjusted below that paid by the Series A investors. The procedure

to obtain the adjustment is found by dividing the conversion valuation cap

(\$6 million in our example) by the pre-money valuation (\$8 million in our

illustration). In our illustration, the adjustment is then 75%. Thus the

convertible note investors will pay 75% of what is paid by the Series A

investors to buy the preferred stock. Because Series A investors pay \$1 per

share of preferred stock, the convertible note investors pay only \$0.75. And

so because the convertible note investors are converting \$360,000 (principal

plus accrued interest), they will receive 480,000 prefer stock shares

($360,000/$0.75).

```
Debt with Warrants

```

Another form of debt that is an equity dilutive security is debt with warrants

to purchase the company's common stock. A **warrant** is a form of option

that grants the warrant holder the right to exercise it and receive a specified

security. Often this type of financing is raised in the later stages of a

company to obtain financing between rounds of financing (i.e., bridge

financing).

For example, a company might issue convertible debt with warrants to

purchase up to 15% of the common stock. This is referred to as "convertible

debt with 15% warrant coverage." Suppose that the par value of this

convertible debt is \$5 million. Then investors in this convertible debt with

warrants have the right to purchase $750,000 (0.15 × $5 million) of the

issuer's common stock. The exercise price for the warrants is determined by

what investors in the next round of financing agree to pay for the common

stock. Thus, what is important is that investors are confident that there will

be another round of financing to determine the conversion price. This is

why such financing is used less often in the very early stages of financing

but occurs later on in bridge financing, when the company has already gone

through several rounds of financing. However, some observrs have

suggested tweaks in the convertible debt with warrant structure to increase

its use in certain early stage financing situations.

Key Points

```

- Every country has its own definition of what a small and medium-sized
enterprise (SME) is.

   - The governments   - f different countries and international
   - rganizations establish their own guidelines for defining SMEs.
   - The metrics used in classifying an enterprise as an SME include the
number of employees, level of sales (revenue), and total assets.

   - Governments provide various programs and initiatives to increase
the funding available to qualified SMEs.

   - Early-stage financing includes the seed round and the first round.
  - In the seed round, sometimes referred to as the "precommercialization financing stage," the founders seek to finance the
development of a product or service.

   - In very early stage financing, typically the major source of funding
is the personal assets of the founders. Such financing is referred to as
"bootstrap financing."

   - In first round financing (or Series A round financing), the milestone
that has been reached is the generation of revenue, even though neither
break-even operations nor profits are typically reached at this stage.

   - It is typically difficult for founders to obtain bank financing in the
seed stage (except when the founders have sufficient collateral or
assets to provide personal guarantees), but once first round financing is

   - btained, specialty banks and nonbank entities are willing to provide

venture debt that contains an equity kicker for the lender in the form of

warrants.

- Sources for seed-round financing are credit cards, vendors, Small
Business Administration (SBA) loans, angel investors and angel
groups, super angels, seed accelerators, incubators, and crowdfunding
platforms, with the most common source of larger amounts of seed
financing being angel investors.

- The types of government-supported funding programs that have
been used by countries make financing more accessible to SMEs and
new ventures are loan guarantees, direct credit loans, loan subsidies,
grant programs, and preferable tax treatment for lenders to SMEs.

- Expansion-stage financing is undertaken to expand the company's
business by increasing production and acquiring customers through
marketing.

- Expansion-stage financing includes bridge loans, second-round
financing (Series B round financing), third-round financing (also
called "Series C round financing"), and so on.

- Additional rounds of financing may be necessary if the company
does not have a liquidating event after several rounds of financing. The
entry of a new investor group—institutional investors—has allowed
ventures to raise funds through an IPO by providing substantial funds
for a company to expand without the need to go public.

- The primary source of early-stage funding is angel investors,
wealthy individuals who typically invest between \$150,000 and \$2
million and who qualify under the SEC's definition of "accredited
investors."

- In addition to providing funding, angel investors provide strategic
planning advice, assist in team building, and provide contacts for
developing key partnerships and further fundraising. Angel investors
typically invest through groups or networks.

- Although venture capitalists invest primarily in first round financing,
venture capital firms that do provide seed financing are referred to as
"super angels" and are set up as private equity firms.

- Crowdfunding is the practice of raising funds for a startup from a
large number of investors who invest small sums, typically over the
Internet. Equity crowdfunding, one form of crowdfunding, allows
investors to obtain an equity interest in a startup company.

- Seed accelerators offer the opportunity for founders to gain access
not only to early stage financing in exchange for equity but also to

- ther potential investors, training in a short period of time, temporary
- ffice space, and a team of experts.
- An incubator is another type of program that mentors entrepreneurs
and other similar services as a seed accelerator.

- The primary sources for expansion financing have historically been
traditional venture capital firms, corporate venture capital firms, and

- nline VC funds.
- Venture capital firms invest in a startup business in the form of
equity, with the investments typically made in series or rounds that
typically occur every two years, based on predetermined milestones
being achieved.

- Venture capital firms are often said to be a special type of private
equity firm that invests in startup companies, in contrast to a typical
private equity firm, which invests in mature companies seeking to go
private or that are viewed to be underperforming and have the potential
for highly attractive returns.

- Corporate venture capitalists are corporations that invest in startups
that have the potential to provide a good strategic fit with their
company's offerings.

- Institutional investors, such as mutual funds and hedge funds, are the
latest entrants providing expansion financing for new ventures prior to
an IPO, an acquisition, or a merger.

- The provision of funding in large sums for expansion by institutional
investors has resulted in new ventures postponing going to the public
to raise funds through an IPO or by being acquired.

- The founders of a company can turn to the general public to meet the
company's needs through an IPO of its shares, whose issuance is

governed by securities laws.

- The two principal advantages of an IPO are (1) publicly traded
common stock provides liquidity for the shares owned by founders, as
well as those owned by investors and employees who are shareholders,
and (2) founders can use shares as a form of currency, allowing them
to make the acquisitions necessary to expand their business and to
attract key executives by offering stock options.

- The disadvantages of an IPO are that the company must comply with
and incur the costs associated with SEC regulatory filing requirements,
faces implicit costs in the form of the time devoted by founders to
preparing the information that a reporting company must provide on a
periodic basis to public investors, faces loss of confidentiality because

- f required disclosures, and management experiences pressure to
perform as expected by shareholders and the financial community to
achieve targeted financial metrics, resulting in the founders shifting
their focus from building a stronger company to achieving short-term
financial targets at the expense of long-term performance.

- In the United States, new ventures issue securities that lead to the
issuance of common stock, referred to as to as "equity dilutive
securities," because investors in startup companies prefer these
securities to a direct investment in common stock.

- Equity dilutive securities include convertible preferred stock and
convertible debt.

- Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines the features of
common stock and a debt obligation; unlike common stockholders,
preferred stockholders typically do not have voting rights except under
certain circumstances.

- In the early stages of a startup company, preferred stock that allows
investors to convert preferred stock into common stock is the vehicle

- f choice for investors.
- Preferred stock comes with provisions that convey rights,
preferences, and privileges to the investors in this security.

   - The par value of preferred stock is important, because if there is a
liquidating event, it typically includes the acquisition or merger of the
company and the selling off of most of the company's assets.

   - Nonparticipating preferred stock does not permit an investor to
participate in any proceeds above the amount of their preference when
a liquidation event occurs.

   - Participating preferred stock allows investors to share along with
common stockholders in some fashion with respect to any remaining
liquidation proceeds.

  - Capped participating preferred stock (partially participating
preferred stock) is a form of preferred stock that allows participation
but is capped at a specified amount.

   - Convertible preferred stock allows the investor to convert into
common stock.

   - A convertible note, typically issued to investors in the early stages of
financing (prior to a Series A round), is a form of debt.

   - Convertible noteholders can have either the option to exchange the
note for an equity position or automatically has the position converted
into an equity position if there is a Series A round of financing.

requirement. The SEC defined a venture capital fund as one that invests in "qualifying investments."
A qualifying investment is mainly in shares of private companies. However, a capital venture fund is
permitted to invest 20% in nonqualifying investments. It may not use significant leverage.

The mortgage market in any country is a collection of markets that includes

a primary (or origination) market and a secondary market where mortgages

trade. A **mortgage** is a pledge of property to secure payment of a debt.

Typically, property refers to real estate. If the property owner/borrower (the

mortgagor) fails to pay the lender (the mortgagee), the lender has the right to

foreclose the loan and seize the property to ensure that the mortgage is

repaid. The types of real estate properties that can be mortgaged are divided

into two broad categories: single-family residential properties and

commercial properties. The former category includes houses,

condominiums, and cooperatives. In the United States, the term of a

mortgage (i.e., the number of years to maturity) ranges from 15 to 30 years.

For most countries in Europe, a residential mortgage typically has a term

between 15 and 40 years, but in some countries (e.g., France and Spain), it

can be as long as 50 years. Japan is an extreme case: The term can be 100

years. Commercial properties are income-producing properties and

multifamily properties (i.e., apartment buildings), office buildings, industrial

properties (including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, and health care

facilities (e.g., senior residential care facilities).

Although our focus in this chapter is on the U.S. residential mortgage

markets and the types of mortgage loans available, we do discuss the wide

range of mortgage types available in other countries. We also discuss the role

- f government in the residential mortgage market.

```
Origination of Residential Mortgage Loans

```

The original lender is called the **mortgage originator** . The principal

- riginators of residential mortgage loans in the United States are thrifts,
commercial banks, and mortgage bankers.

Mortgage originators may generate income from mortgage activity in one

- r more ways. First, they typically charge an **origination fee** . This fee is
expressed in terms of points, where each point represents 1% of the
borrowed funds. For example, an origination fee of two points on a \$200,000
mortgage is \$4,000. Originators also may charge application fees and certain
processing fees. The second source of revenue is the profit that might be
generated from selling a mortgage at a higher price than it originally cost.
This profit is called **secondary market profit** . If mortgage rates rise, an

- riginator will realize a loss when the mortgages are sold in the secondary
market.

Although technically, the sources of revenue attributable to the

- rigination function are origination fees and secondary marketing profits,
there are two other potential sources. First, mortgage originators may service
the mortgages they originate, for which they obtain a **servicing fee** .
Servicing of the mortgage involves collecting monthly payments from
mortgagors and forwarding proceeds to owners of the loan, sending payment
notices to mortgagors, reminding mortgagors when payments are overdue,

maintaining records of mortgage balances, furnishing tax information to

mortgagors, administering an escrow account for real estate taxes and

insurance purposes, and (if necessary) initiating foreclosure proceedings.

The servicing fee is a fixed percentage of the outstanding mortgage balance,

typically 25 basis points to 100 basis points per year. The mortgage

- riginator may sell the servicing of the mortgage to another party, who
would then receive the servicing fee. Second, the mortgage originator may
hold the mortgage in its investment portfolio.

**Mortgage banking** refers to the activity of originating mortgages. Banks
and thrifts undertake mortgage banking. However, there are companies not
associated with a bank or thrift that are involved in mortgage banking. These
mortgage bankers, unlike banks and thrifts, typically do not invest in the
mortgages they originate. Instead, they derive their income from the

- rigination fees. Commercial banks derive their income from all three

sources.

```
The Mortgage Origination Process

```

Someone who wants to borrow funds to purchase a home will apply for a

loan from a mortgage originator. The potential homeowner completes an

application form, which provides financial information about the applicant,

and pays an application fee; then the mortgage originator performs a credit

evaluation of the applicant. The requirements specified by the originator to

grant the loan are referred to as **underwriting standards** .

The two primary quantitative underwriting standards are (1) the

**payment-to-income ratio** (PTI) and (2) the **loan-to-value ratio** (LTV). The

first is the ratio of monthly payments to monthly income, which measures

the ability of the applicant to make monthly payments (both mortgage and

real estate tax payments). The lower this ratio is, the greater the likelihood

that the applicant will be able to meet the required payments.

The difference between the purchase price of the property and the amount

borrowed is the borrower's down payment. The LTV is the ratio of the

amount of the loan to the market (or appraised) value of the property. The

lower this ratio is, the greater the protection for the lender if the applicant

defaults on the payments and the lender must repossess and resell the

property. For example, if an applicant wants to borrow \$225,000 on a

property with an appraised value of \$300,000, the LTV is 75%. Suppose the

applicant subsequently defaults on the mortgage. The lender can then

repossess the property and sell it to recover the amount owed. But the

amount that will be received by the lender depends on the market value of

the property. In our example, even if conditions in the housing market are

weak, the lender will still be able to recover the proceeds lent if the value of

the property declines by \$75,000. Suppose instead that the applicant wanted

to borrow \$270,000 for the same property. The LTV would then be 90%. If

the lender had to foreclose on the property and then sell it because the

applicant defaulted, there is less protection for the lender.

If the lender decides to lend the funds, it sends a **commitment letter** to

the applicant. This letter commits the lender to provide funds to the

applicant. The length of time of the commitment varies between 30 and 60

days. At the time of the commitment letter, the lender will require that the

applicant pay a commitment fee. It is important to understand that the

commitment letter obligates the lender—not the applicant—to perform. The

commitment fee that the applicant pays is lost if the applicant decides not to

purchase the property or uses an alternative source of funds to purchase the

property. Thus, the commitment letter states that, for a fee, the applicant has

the right but not the obligation to require the lender to provide funds at a

certain interest rate and on certain terms. The lender has effectively granted

the applicant an option to borrow the funds, with the commitment fee paid

by the applicant being the option price.

Mortgage originators can either (1) hold the mortgage in their portfolios,

(2) sell the mortgage to an investor that wishes to hold the mortgage in its

portfolio, (3) place the mortgage in a pool of mortgages to be used as

collateral for the issuance of a security, or (4) sell the mortgage to another

party that will place the mortgage in a pool of mortgages to be used as

collateral for a security. When a mortgage is used as collateral for the

issuance of a security, the mortgage is said to be a **securitized mortgage** .

We discuss the securitization of residential mortgages in chapter 30. An

entity that purchases mortgages from mortgage originators for the purpose of

using them as collateral in a securitization is said to be a **mortgage conduit** .

```
Risks Associated with Mortgage Origination

```

The loan applications being processed and the commitments made by a

mortgage originator together are referred to as its _pipeline_ . **Pipeline risk**

refers to the risks associated with originating mortgages. This risk has two

components: price risk and fallout risk.

**Price risk** refers to the adverse effects on the value of the pipeline if
mortgage rates in the market rise. If mortgage rates rise, and if the mortgage

- riginator has made commitments at a lower mortgage rate, it will either
have to sell the mortgages when they close at a value below the funds lent to
homeowners or retain the mortgages as a portfolio investment earning a
below-market mortgage rate. The mortgage originator faces the same risk for
mortgage applications in the pipeline on which the applicants have elected to
fix the rate at the time the applications were submitted.

**Fallout risk** is the risk that applicants or those who were issued
commitment letters will not close (i.e., complete the transaction by
purchasing the property with funds borrowed from the mortgage originator).
A major reason potential borrowers may cancel their commitments or
withdraw their mortgage applications is that mortgage rates decline
sufficiently that it is economic to seek an alternative lender. Fallout risk is
the result of the mortgage originator giving the potential borrower the right
but not the obligation to close (i.e., the right to cancel the agreement).
Reasons other than a decline in mortgage rates may also cause a potential
borrower to fall out of the pipeline. The property inspection report may be
unfavorable, or the purchase could have been predicated on a change in
employment that does not occur.

Mortgage originators have several alternatives to protect themselves

against pipeline risk. To protect against price risk, the originator could get a

commitment from the entity to whom the mortgage originator plans to sell

the mortgage. This sort of commitment is effectively a forward contract, a

contract we will discuss in chapter 33. The mortgage originator agrees to

deliver a mortgage at a future date, and another party (such as a conduit)

agrees to buy the mortgage at that time at a predetermined price (or

mortgage rate).

Consider what happens, however, if mortgage rates decline and potential

borrowers elect to cancel the agreement. The mortgage originator has agreed

to deliver a mortgage with a specified mortgage rate. If the potential

borrower does not close and the mortgage originator has made a

commitment to deliver the mortgage to a conduit, the mortgage originator

cannot back out of the transaction. As a result, the mortgage originator will

realize a loss—it must deliver a mortgage at a higher mortgage rate in a

lower-mortgage-rate environment. This is fallout risk.

Mortgage originators can protect themselves against fallout risk by

entering into an agreement with a conduit for optional rather than mandatory

delivery of the mortgage. In such an agreement, the mortgage originator is

effectively buying an option that gives it the right, but not the obligation, to

deliver a mortgage. (Recall that when the originator issued the commitment

letter, it gave the applicant such an option.) The conduit has sold that option

to the mortgage originator and therefore charges a fee for allowing optional

delivery.

```
Mortgage Servicers

```

Every mortgage loan must be serviced. As explained earlier, servicing a

mortgage involves collecting monthly payments and forwarding proceeds to

- wners of the loan, sending payment notices to mortgagors, reminding
mortgagors when payments are overdue, maintaining records of principal
balances, administering an escrow balance for real estate taxes and insurance
purposes, initiating foreclosure proceedings if necessary, and furnishing tax
information to mortgagors when applicable.

Mortgage servicers include bank-related entities, thrift-related entities,

and mortgage bankers. Four sources of revenue arise from mortgage

servicing. The primary source is the servicing fee. This fee is a fixed

percentage of the outstanding mortgage balance. Consequently, the revenue

from servicing declines over time as the mortgage balance declines over

time if the borrower is required to make monthly payments to reduce the

mortgage balance. The second source of servicing income arises from the

interest that can be earned by the servicer from the escrow balance that a

borrower often maintains with a servicer. The third source of revenue is the

float earned on the monthly mortgage payment. This opportunity arises

because of the delay permitted between the time the servicer receives the

payment and the time that the payment must be sent to the investor. Fourth,

there are several sources of ancillary income: (1) a late fee collected by the

servicer if the mortgage payment is not made on time, (2) commissions from

cross-selling the borrowers' insurance products, and (3) fees generated from

selling mailing lists.

```
Types of Residential Mortgage Loans

```

There are different types of residential mortgages available in countries that

have a mortgage market. They can be classified according to the following

attributes:

   - interest rate type,
   - repayment structure,
   - treatment of prepayments,
   - lender's recourse,
   - lien status,
   - credit classification,
   - credit guarantees, and
   - conforming versus nonconforming status.

```
Interest Rate Type

```

The interest rate on a mortgage is referred to as the **mortgage rate** - r **note**

**rate** . Based on interest rate type, mortgages can be classified as follows:

   - fixed-rate mortgage,
   - indexed adjustable-rate mortgage,
   - reviewable adjustable-rate mortgage,
   - rollover (renegotiable) mortgage,
   - hybrid mortgage, or
   - convertible mortgage.

For a **fixed-rate mortgage** (FRM), the mortgage is unchanged over the

term of the mortgage. Mortgages of this type can be found in many

countries, including the United States, France, Germany, and Denmark, and

they are the most common mortgage type in the first two countries listed. In

the early years of the development of the mortgage credit market in those

countries, the FRM was the most common type of mortgage. The FRM was

the most common type in Denmark until recently and in Italy, Spain, and

Greece until the early 1990s. Today the dominant mortgage type in Europe

and in most other countries is the one we describe next.

An **adjustable-rate mortgage** (ARM), also referred to as a **variable-**

**rate mortgage**, is one whose rate resets periodically. The frequency at

which the mortgage rate resets can be monthly, semiannually, or annually.

The major risk of using an ARM from the borrower's perspective is that the

mortgage rate may increase so dramatically as a result of conditions in the

capital market that it may significantly impair the borrower's ability to meet

the mortgage payments. To reduce this risk for borrowers, referred to as

"payment shock risk," there is typically a cap on how high the mortgage rate

can increase. There may be a periodic rate cap, a lifetime rate cap, or both. A

**periodic rate cap** limits the amount that the mortgage rate may increase at

the reset date. A **lifetime rate cap** specifies the maximum rate that may be

imposed over the mortgage's life. When there is a cap, the lender is sharing

the payment shock risk with the borrower. An ARM may also specify a floor

below which the mortgage rate cannot be reduced, periodically or over the

mortgage's term. The inclusion of a floor in the mortgage reduces the

interest rate shock risk faced by the lender.

In the United States, a typical ARM agreement has both types of rate

caps. In some countries, any rate cap may be set so high that it does not

really reduce the borrower's payment shock risk. Spain is an example. It is

not uncommon to find realistic rate caps in EU member countries, where the

FRM dominates and the ARM is an alternative mortgage product offered by

lenders. This is the situation in France, where the rate cap is set at 200 basis

points above the initial mortgage rate. [1]

The method for determining the new mortgage rate at a reset date

determines the type of ARM, either index referenced or reviewable. For an

**indexed ARM**, referred to as an **index tracker ARM** in the European
Union, the mortgage rate at a reset date is set by a formula that links the
mortgage rate to an interest rate index. For example, in the United States, an
index-referenced ARM that resets every year might be linked to the one-year
U.S. Treasury bill rate. In Korea and Spain, index-referenced ARMs
dominate. [2] When the amount of the adjustment of the mortgage rate at a
reset date is at the discretion of the lender, the mortgage is called a
**reviewable ARM** . In Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, this is the
dominant mortgage type. [3]

As with an ARM, a rollover mortgage (or renegotiable mortgage) and a

hybrid mortgage have a fixed mortgage rate that is adjusted after a specified

period of time. What distinguishes a rollover mortgage from a hybrid

mortgage is the type of mortgage rate after the initial specified period. If

after the reset date the mortgage rate is fixed for another period, it is called a

**rollover mortgage** . In some countries, the new fixed rate might be for the

remainder of the mortgage's life. A rollover mortgage is the dominant form

in Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. [4] When the

mortgage starts out at a fixed rate and then becomes an ARM after a

specified initial term, the mortgage is referred to as a **hybrid mortgage** . For

example, a hybrid mortgage might have a fixed rate for the first five years,

then after five years it might convert to an indexed ARM that is adjusted

every year.

Finally, a **convertible mortgage** starts out with a mortgage rate that for a

specified period of time can be either fixed or adjustable. The borrower has

the option to convert the mortgage into an FRM or an ARM for the

remainder of the mortgage's term. The appeal to borrowers of this type of

mortgage is that it mitigates payment shock risk. This type of mortgage is

available in the United States and several other countries. Almost half of the

mortgages in Japan are convertible. [5]

```
Repayment Structure

```

The amount borrowed is referred to the "original mortgage balance." The

amount that must be repaid by the end of the mortgage term and the method

for doing so are referred to as the **repayment structure** . Typically a

mortgage payment is made monthly. If any amount of the monthly mortgage

payment exceeds the amount of the interest required for that amount, the

excess amount is used to reduce the original mortgage balance. A lender

would prefer a mortgage where some principal is repaid over the mortgage's

term to reduce the credit risk it faces when lending against the property.

The repayment of the principal borrowed as part of the monthly loan

payment is referred to as **amortization** . The mortgage can specify that each

monthly payment include amortization. That is, the monthly mortgage

payment can include the monthly interest based on the mortgage balance at

the beginning of the month plus a scheduled principal amount that represents

scheduled amortization. A mortgage that specifies a scheduled payment of

principal that the borrower must make is referred to as an **amortizing**

**mortgage** . An amortizing mortgage is typical in most countries.

For an amortizing mortgage, the monthly scheduled principal payments

can be such that when all scheduled principal payments are added, the total

is equal to the original mortgage balance. As a result, when the borrower

makes the final monthly mortgage payment, the last payment is enough to

cover the outstanding mortgage balance for that month. As a result, no

further payments are required by the borrower. For example, suppose a

mortgage has an original mortgage balance of \$200,000, a mortgage rate of

7.5%, and a term of 30 years. Then the monthly mortgage payment would be

\$1,398.43. Notice that the monthly mortgage payment is the same over all

360 months. How this monthly mortgage payment is determined is explained

in the appendix to this chapter. Assuming that the borrower has made all 360

monthly payments on a timely basis, then it can be shown (see the appendix)

that after the last monthly mortgage payment is made, the outstanding

mortgage balance is zero (i.e., the mortgage is paid off). This type of

amortizing mortgage is referred to as a **fully amortizing mortgage** and is

the typical mortgage in the United States.

Although our illustration is for an FRM, an ARM is also typically a fully

amortizing mortgage. Because the mortgage rate changes, the monthly

mortgage payment has to be recalculated at each reset date so that the new

monthly mortgage payments are sufficient to fully amortize the outstanding

mortgage balance at the reset date. This determination of the new monthly

mortgage payment, explained in the appendix, is referred to as "recasting the

mortgage." For example, let's consider once again a \$200,000, 30-year

mortgage. Assume that the mortgage is an ARM that adjusts annually and

that the initial mortgage rate (i.e., the mortgage rate for the first 12 months)

is 7.5%. It can be shown that at the end of the 12th month, the outstanding

mortgage balance would be \$198,156.33. Recasting the mortgage involves

computing the monthly mortgage payment that will fully amortize a

mortgage of \$198,156.33 for 29 years (348 months) because after one year,

there are 29 years remaining on the loan. The interest rate used to recast the

mortgage is the new mortgage rate at the reset date. Suppose that the reset

rate is 8.5%. Then the monthly mortgage payment to fully amortize the

mortgage can be shown to be \$1,535.26, and that is therefore the monthly

mortgage payment for the next 12 months.

An amortizing mortgage can be such that the total of the monthly

scheduled principal payments is less than the original mortgage balance. For

such amortizing mortgages, referred to as **partial amortizing mortgages**,

the amount owed at the end of the mortgage's term is the difference between

the original mortgage balance and the total of the scheduled principal

payment and any unscheduled principal payment that might have been made.

This amount, which must be paid by the borrower to the lender, is referred to

as a **balloon payment** .

In countries such as Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,

Greece, Ireland, Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and

the United Kingdom, and to a limited extent the United States, mortgages are

available that require no monthly scheduled principal payments for a

specified period of time. [6] Instead, only the monthly interest is paid for that

period, and therefore there is no amortization of the original mortgage

balance. This type of mortgage is referred to an **interest-only mortgage** .

The period of time during which there is no scheduled principal payment is

called the **lockout period** . After the lockout period, the monthly mortgage

changes so that the monthly mortgage payments include a scheduled

principal amount that is sufficient to fully amortize the original amount of

the loan over the remaining term of the loan. A special type of interest-only

mortgage is one with no scheduled principal payments over the life of the

mortgage. This type of mortgage, referred to as an **interest-only life**

**mortgage** - r a **bullet mortgage**, is available in Denmark, the Netherlands,

and the United Kingdom. This type of mortgage obviously exposes lenders

to greater credit risk than an amortizing mortgage.

```
Treatment of Prepayments

```

Borrowers often want the right to repay all or part of their mortgage balance

before the scheduled maturity date. This may be desirable for many reasons,

but a key reason is that if market interest rates decline and the borrower has

the opportunity to refinance at a lower mortgage rate, the economic value of

refinancing can be considerable, even after taking into account the costs

associated with obtaining a new mortgage.

The amount of the payment made in excess of the monthly mortgage

payment is called a **prepayment** . As an example, consider once again the

30-year, \$200,000 mortgage with a 7.5% mortgage rate. The monthly

mortgage payment is \$1,398.43. Suppose the borrower makes a payment of

\$5,398.43. This payment exceeds the monthly mortgage payment by \$4,000.

This amount represents a prepayment and reduces the outstanding mortgage

balance by \$4,000. This type of prepayment, in which the entire mortgage

balance is not paid off, is called a **partial prepayment** - r **curtailment** .

When a curtailment is made, the mortgage is not recast (i.e., the monthly

mortgage payment is not changed). Instead, the borrower continues to make

the same monthly mortgage payment. The effect of the prepayment is that

more of the subsequent monthly mortgage payment is applied to reduce the

- utstanding mortgage balance. The more common type of prepayment is one
in which the entire outstanding mortgage balance is paid off before the
mortgage's contractual maturity.

Effectively, the borrower's right to prepay a mortgage in whole or in part

without a penalty is a call option. The mortgage that mitigates the

borrower's right to prepay is a **prepayment penalty mortgage** . This type of

mortgage imposes penalties if the borrower prepays. The penalties are

designed to discourage refinancing activity and require a fee to be paid if the

loan is prepaid within a certain amount of time after funding.

Because the major concern for a lender is that the borrower will prepay

when interest rates decline, prepayment penalties can be viewed as a form of

yield maintenance provision that can be found in callable bonds and (as

explained in chapter 31) commercial mortgages. Prepayment penalty

mortgages that are available in the United States are typically structured to

allow borrowers to partially prepay up to 20% of their loan each year the

penalty is in effect, and charge the borrower six months of interest for

prepayments on the remaining 80% of their balance. Some penalties are

waived if the property is sold and are described as "soft" penalties; hard

penalties require the penalty to be paid even if the prepayment occurs as a

result of the sale of the property.

The laws and regulations governing the imposition of prepayment

penalties are established not only by each country but even by jurisdictions

within a country. Laws in European countries typically permit penalties for

prepayment, and in fact, prepayment penalty mortgages are common in

Europe. In the United States, usually the applicable laws for FRMs are

specified at the state level. Some states do not allow prepayment penalties on

FRMs. Other states do permit them but restrict the type of penalty. For

ARMS, certain federal laws override state laws. Consequently, although the

proportion of prepayment penalty mortgages is small in the United States,

they do exist in states that permit the imposition of such penalties.

```
Lender’s Recourse

```

Borrowers do default. When that occurs, the lender has the right to repossess

the property and then sell it. However, if the proceeds received from the sale

- f the property are less than the outstanding mortgage balance, what can the
lender do to recover the loss? The answer depends on whether the loan is a
recourse or a nonrecourse loan. If the lender is entitled to have a claim

against the borrower for the shortfall, the mortgage is said to be a **recourse**

**loan** . Thus, the lender can look to the borrower's other assets to try to

recover through the legal system as much of the shortfall as possible. With a

**nonrecourse mortgage**, unless there is some claim of fraud, the lender does

not have a claim against the borrower. That is, the lender can only look to

the property to recover the outstanding mortgage balance.

Whether the lender is entitled to recourse in the case of a default varies

by country. In the United States, all mortgages to purchase a residence are

nonrecourse mortgages. In European countries and Japan, mortgage lending

is on a recourse basis. This is one of the reasons for the higher mortgage

default rates in the United States than in European countries and Japan. It is

the statutory ban on recourse lending for residential mortgage property in the

United States that provides an incentive for borrowers to exercise their

- ption to default when their home values have declined below the
- utstanding mortgage balance, even if they have sufficient financial
resources to make timely mortgage payments. Such a practice by borrowers
is referred to as a "strategic default."

```
Lien Status

```

The **lien status** - f a mortgage indicates the lender's seniority in the event of

the forced liquidation of the property owing to the borrower's default. For a

mortgage that is a **first lien**, the lender would have first call on the proceeds

- f the liquidation of the property if it were to be repossessed. A mortgage
could also be a **second lien** - r **junior lien**, and the claims of the lender on
the proceeds in the case of liquidation would come after the lender who had
a first lien was paid in full.

```
Credit Classification

```

In the United States, a mortgage originated for which the borrower is

considered to be of high credit quality (i.e., the borrower has strong

employment and credit histories, income sufficient to make the mortgage

payments without compromising the borrower's creditworthiness, and

substantial equity in the underlying property) is classified as a **prime loan** .

A loan originated for which the borrower is of lower credit quality or where

the loan is not a first lien on the property is classified as a **subprime loan** .

Between the prime and the subprime sector is a somewhat nebulous category

referred to as an **alternative-A loan**, or more commonly an **alt-A loan** .

These loans are considered to be prime loans (the "A" refers to the A grade

assigned by underwriting agencies), but they have some attributes that either

increase their perceived credit riskiness or cause them to be difficult to

categorize and evaluate.

When assessing the credit quality of a mortgage applicant, lenders look at

various measures.

The starting point is the applicant's credit score. Several firms collect

data on the payment histories of individuals from lending institutions and,

using statistical models, evaluate and quantify individual creditworthiness in

terms of a credit score. Basically, a credit score is a numerical grade for the

credit history of the borrower. The three most popular credit reporting

companies that compute credit scores are Experian, Transunion, and

Equifax. Although the credit scores are determined using different methods,

the scores generically are referred to as **FICO scores** . [7] Typically, a lender

will obtain more than one score, to minimize the impact of variations in

credit scores across providers. FICO scores range from 350 to 850. The

higher the FICO score is, the lower is the credit risk.

The LTV has proved to be a good predictor of default: the higher the

LTV, the greater the likelihood of default. By definition, the LTV of the loan

in a purchase transaction is a function of both the down payment and the

purchase price of the property. Lenders calculate income ratios, such as the

PTI, to assess the applicant's ability to pay. These ratios compare the

monthly mortgage payment that the applicant would have to pay if the loan

is granted to the applicant's monthly income. The most common measures

are the front ratio and the back ratio. The **front ratio** is computed by

dividing the total monthly payment (which includes interest and principal on

the loan plus property taxes and homeowner insurance) by the applicant's

pre-tax monthly income. The **back ratio** is computed in a similar manner.

The modification is that the back ratio adds other debt payments, such as

auto loan and credit card payments, to the total payments. For a loan to be

classified as "prime," the front and back ratios should be no more than 28%

and 36%, respectively.

The credit score is the primary attribute used to characterize loans as

either prime or subprime. Prime (or A-grade) loans generally are made to

borrowers with FICO scores of 660 or higher, front and back ratios with the

above-noted maximums of 28% and 36%, and LTVs less than 95%. Alt-A

loans may vary in a number of important ways. Although subprime loans

typically are associated with borrower FICO scores below 660, the loan

programs and grades are highly lender specific. One lender might consider a

loan with a 620 FICO score to be a "B-rated loan," whereas another lender

could grade the same loan higher or lower, especially if the other attributes

- f the loan (such as the LTV) are higher or lower than average levels.

Outside the United States, there are loans available to credit-impaired

borrowers seeking to obtain a mortgage. For example, in the United

Kingdom, such mortgages are referred to as "nonconforming" mortgages

and include lending to individuals who had previously declared bankruptcy.

Two other countries that make mortgages available to credit-impaired

borrowers are Ireland and Spain (where lending is available to immigrants

who want to reside in major Spanish cities and who have no or limited credit

histories). Europe even has its version of Alt-A lending. [8]

```
Credit Guarantees

```

Mortgages can be classified based on whether there is some third-party

guaranty. The guaranty can be one provided by the national government, a

related entity, or a private entity.

In the United States, loans that are backed by agencies of the federal

government are referred to under the generic term of **government loans** and

are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The

Department of Housing and Urban Development oversees two agencies that

guarantee government loans. The first is the Federal Housing Administration

(FHA), a governmental entity created by Congress in 1934 that became part

- f the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1965. **FHA-**
**insured loans** are for those borrowers who can afford only a low down
payment and who generally also have relatively low levels of income. The
second is the Veterans Administration (VA), which is part of the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs. **VA-guaranteed loans** are made to eligible
veterans and reservists, allowing them to receive favorable loan terms.
Although there is no maximum amount for the loans that are guaranteed,
typically the loans are limited to an amount determined by statute, because
when the VA sells loans that it originates in the secondary market, these
limits become important, as explained later in this chapter and in chapter 30.

In contrast to government loans, other loans have no explicit guaranty

from the federal government. Such loans are said to be obtained through

"conventional financing" and therefore are referred to in the market as

**conventional mortgages** . A conventional mortgage may not be insured

when it is originated, but a mortgage may qualify to be insured when it is

included in a pool of mortgages that secures a mortgage-backed security

(MBS). More specifically, MBSs are securities issued by two governmentsponsored enterprises, Freddie Mac (previously the Federal Home Loan

Mortgage Corporation) and Fannie Mae (previously the Federal National

Mortgage Association), entities we discuss in more detail in chapter 30.

Because the guaranties of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae do not carry the full

faith and credit of the U.S. government, they are not classified as

government loans.

A conventional loan can be insured by a **private mortgage insurer** .

Typically the borrower is required to obtain private mortgage insurance

when the down payment is less than 20% of the property's purchase price

(i.e., when the LTV is greater than 0.8). Because the insurance comes from a

private entity, from an investor's perspective, the guaranty is only as good as

the credit rating of the insurer.

```
Conforming versus Nonconforming Status

```

As explained in chapter 30, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs) whose mission is to provide liquidity and

support to the mortgage market. Although they are private corporations, they

receive a charter from the federal government. This federal charter allows

these GSEs to operate with certain benefits that are unavailable to other

corporations. However, the federal charter imposes limits on their business

activities.

One of the ways that they fulfill their mission is by buying and selling

mortgages. [9] The mortgages they purchase can be held in a portfolio or

packaged to create an MBS. The securities they create are the subject of

chapter 30. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy or sell any type of

residential mortgage, but the mortgages that are packaged into securities are

restricted to government loans and those that satisfy their underwriting

guidelines. The conventional loans that qualify are referred to as

**conforming loans** . Thus, a conforming loan is simply a conventional loan

that meets the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Conventional loans in the market are referred to as **conforming**

**conventional loans** - r **nonconforming conventional loans** .

One of the underwriting standards is the loan balance at the time of

- rigination. For government loans and the loans guaranteed by Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae, there are limits on the loan balance. The maximum loan
size for oneto four-family homes changes every year, based on the
percentage change in the average home price (for both new and existing
homes) published by the Federal Housing Finance Board. The loan limits for
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are identical, because they are specified by the
same statute. For example, effective January 1, 2013, the conforming limit
for residential mortgages was \$417,000 and is higher for areas designated as
high-cost regions. Loans larger than the conforming limit for a given
property type are referred to as **jumbo mortgages** .

Other important underwriting standards that must be satisfied relate to the

following:

   - the type of property (primary residence, vacation or second home,
investment property),

   - loan type (e.g., fixed rate, ARM),
   - LTV ratio by loan type,
   - the borrower's credit history, and
   - documentation.

Qualifying for a conforming mortgage is important for both the borrower

and the mortgage originator, because the two GSEs are the largest buyers of

mortgages in the United States. Hence, mortgages that qualify as conforming

loans have a greater probability of being purchased by Fannie Mae and

Freddie Mac to be packaged into an MBS. As a result, they are available at

lower interest rates than are nonconforming conventional mortgages.

When the term "conforming mortgage" is used in other countries, its

meaning may be quite different. We mentioned in our discussion of the

credit classification of mortgages that in the United Kingdom, the term used

for mortgage loans made to credit-impaired borrowers is "nonconforming"

mortgage loans. In the United States, such a mortgage would probably be

classified as a subprime mortgage. A mortgage in the United Kingdom

provided to a creditworthy borrower (however that might be defined in that

country) is referred to as a "conforming mortgage." The important point here

is that in other countries, the terms "conforming mortgage" and

"nonconforming mortgage" have nothing to do with how the terms are used

in the United States, where they simply (and exclusively) denote whether a

mortgage satisfies the requirements of the two GSEs.

```
Investment Risks

```

The principal investors in mortgage loans include thrifts and commercial

banks. Pension funds and life insurance companies also invest in these loans,

but their ownership is small compared to that of the banks and thrifts.

Investors face four main risks when they invest in residential mortgage

loans: (1) credit risk, (2) liquidity risk, (3) price risk, and (4) prepayment

risk.

```
Credit Risk

```

Credit risk is the risk that the homeowner/borrower will default. For FHA

and VA-insured mortgages, this risk is minimal. For privately insured

mortgages, the risk can be gauged by the credit rating of the private

insurance company that has insured the mortgage. For conventional

mortgages that are uninsured, the credit risk depends on the credit quality of

the borrower. The LTV ratio provides a useful measure of the risk of loss of

principal in case of default. When the LTV ratio is high, default is more

likely, because the borrower has little equity in the property.

```
Liquidity Risk

```

Although there is a secondary market for residential mortgages, which we

discuss in chapter 30, the bid-ask spreads are nonetheless large compared to

those of other debt instruments. That is, mortgages tend to be rather illiquid,

because they are large and indivisible.

```
Price Risk

```

The price of a fixed-income instrument will move in the opposite direction

from market interest rates. Thus, a rise in interest rates will decrease the

price of a mortgage loan.

```
Prepayment Risk

```

The three components of the monthly cash flow are (1) interest, (2) principal

repayment (scheduled principal payment or amortization), and (3) any

prepayment.

**Prepayment risk** is the risk associated with a mortgage's cash flow
stemming from prepayments. More specifically, investors are concerned that
borrowers will pay off a mortgage when prevailing mortgage rates fall below
the borrower's mortgage rate. For example, if the borrower's mortgage rate

- n a mortgage originated five years ago is 6% and the prevailing mortgage
rate (i.e., the rate at which a new mortgage can be obtained) is 3.5%, then
there is an incentive for the borrower to refinance the mortgage. The
decision to refinance will depend on several factors, but the single most
important one is the prevailing mortgage rate compared to the borrower's

mortgage rate.

The disadvantage to the investor is that the proceeds received from the

repayment of the loan must be reinvested at a lower interest rate than that

currently earned on the proceeds lent to the borrower. This risk is the same

as that faced by an investor in a callable bond. However, unlike a callable

bond, there is no premium that may have to be paid by the borrower in the

case of a residential mortgage loan except possibly for a prepayment penalty

mortgage. Any principal repaid in advance of the scheduled due date is paid

at par value.

```
Development of the Secondary Mortgage Market

```

The foundations for the secondary mortgage market can be traced back to

the Great Depression and the legislation that followed. The response by

Congress to the Great Depression and its effects on financial markets was to

establish several public-purpose agencies. The Federal Reserve provided

increased liquidity for commercial banks through the Federal Reserve

discount window. Liquidity for thrifts was provided by the creation of the

Federal Home Loan Banks, which were granted the right to borrow from the

Treasury. The purpose of creating the Federal Home Loan Banks was to

construct a reserve credit system to support housing finance and provide

relief for both homeowners and lending institutions impacted by the Great

Depression.

Another creation of Congress to help the housing finance market was the

FHA, intended to address the problems presented by the mortgage loans

used in housing finance at that time. This government agency developed and

promoted the fixed-rate, level-payment, fully amortized mortgage. The FHA

also reduced credit risk for investors by offering insurance against mortgage

defaults. Not all loans could be insured, however—the mortgage applicant

had to satisfy FHA underwriting standards, which made the FHA the first

- rganization to standardize mortgage terms. Although we may take
standardization for granted today, it was the basis for the development of a
secondary mortgage market. In 1944, the VA began insuring qualified loans.

But who was going to invest in these loans? Thrifts could do so,

especially with the inducement provided by several tax and regulatory

advantages at the time. But the investment would be illiquid in the absence

- f a market for trading mortgages. Congress thought of that, too. In 1938, it
created a federal government agency, the Federal National Mortgage
Association. This agency, now officially known as Fannie Mae, was charged
with the creating a liquid secondary market for FHAand VA-insured loans,
which it tried to accomplish by buying loans. Fannie Mae needed a funding
source in case it faced a liquidity squeeze. Congress provided it by giving
Fannie Mae a credit line with the Treasury.

In 1954, legislation transformed Fannie Mae from a government agency

into a GSE. Despite the creation of Fannie Mae, the secondary mortgage

market did not develop to any significant extent. During periods of tight

money, Fannie Mae could do little to mitigate a housing crisis. In 1968,

Congress divided Fannie Mae into two organizations: (1) the current Fannie

Mae, and (2) the Government National Mortgage Association, popularly

known as Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae's function is to use the "full faith and

credit of the U.S. government" to support the FHA and VA mortgage

market. Two years later, in 1970, Congress authorized Fannie Mae to

purchase conventional loans (i.e., those not insured by the FHA or VA) and

created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (popularly known as

Freddie Mac) to provide support for FHAand VA-insured mortgages and

conventional mortgages.

Ginnie Mae accomplished its objective by guaranteeing securities issued

by private entities that pooled loans together and then used these loans as

collateral for the security sold. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae purchased

loans, pooled them, and issued securities, using the pool of loans as

collateral. The securities created are called "mortgage pass-through

securities" and are described in chapter 30. They are purchased by many

types of investors (domestic and foreign) who previously shunned

investment in the mortgage market.

The driving force in the development of a strong secondary market for

residential mortgage loans was a financial innovation that involved the

packaging (or "pooling") of loans and the issuance of securities

collateralized by these loans. As we explained in chapter 27, this process,

called "asset securitization," is radically different from the traditional system

for financing the acquisition of assets. The traditional system calls for one

financial intermediary (such as a commercial bank, thrift, or insurance

company) to (1) originate a loan; (2) retain the loan in its portfolio of assets,

thereby accepting the credit risk associated with the loan; (3) service the loan

by collecting payments and providing tax or other information to the

borrower; and (4) obtain funds from the public with which to finance its

assets (except for the small amount representing the institution's equity).

By using asset securitization, more than one institution may be involved

in lending capital. In the case of mortgage activities, a lending scenario can

look like this:

1. A thrift or commercial bank originates a loan.
2. The thrift or commercial bank sells its mortgages to an investment
banking firm that creates a security backed by the pool of loans.

3. The investment banker obtains credit risk insurance for the pool of
loans from a private insurance company.

4. The investment banker sells the right to service the loans to another
thrift or a company specializing in servicing loans.

5. The investment banking firm sells the securities to individuals and
institutional investors.

Besides the original bank or thrift, participants include an investment bank,

an insurance company, another thrift, an individual, and other institutional

investors. The bank or thrift in this case does not have to absorb the credit

risk, service the mortgage, or provide the funding.

In 1970, Ginnie Mae pioneered and issued the first MBS. The following

year, Freddie Mac issued its first MBS; and in 1981, Fannie Mae issued its

first MBS. In the 1980s, private issuers of MBSs that did not use the backing

- f the three agencies but instead some form of private credit enhancement
(described in chapter 30) began issuing MBSs backed by conventional
residential mortgage loans.

The major setback to the market and to the future of Fannie Mae and

Freddie Mac was the crisis in the subprime MBS market that began in the

summer of 2007. We describe the crisis in chapter 30 and explain how it led

to the placing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of

the Federal Housing Finance Agency in September 2008. In addition, we

discuss proposals to terminate the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

```
Key Points

```

- The mortgage market in any country is a collection of markets that
includes a primary (or origination) market and a secondary market where
mortgages trade.

   - A mortgage is a pledge of property to secure payment of a debt with
the property, typically a form of real estate.

   - The types of real estate properties that can be mortgaged are divided
into two broad categories: single-family residential properties and
commercial properties. The former category includes houses,
condominiums, and cooperatives.

   - Commercial properties are income-producing properties: multifamily
properties (i.e., apartment buildings), office buildings, industrial
properties (including warehouses), shopping centers, hotels, and health
care facilities (e.g., senior residential care facilities).

- Mortgage originators (i.e., the original lenders) include thrifts,
commercial banks, and mortgage bankers.

- Mortgage originators charge an origination fee and may generate
additional income in other ways.

- The two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, can purchase any type of loan; however, the only
conventional loans they can securitize to create a mortgage-backed
security (MBS) are conforming loans, that is, conventional loans that
satisfy their underwriting standards.

- For a mortgage originator, "pipeline risk" refers to the risks
associated with originating mortgages. This risk has two components,
price risk and fallout risk.

- "Price risk refers" to the adverse effects on the value of the pipeline if
mortgage rates in the market rise.

- Fallout risk is the risk that applicants or those who were issued
commitment letters will not close (i.e., complete the transaction by
purchasing the property with funds borrowed from the mortgage

- riginator).
- The two primary quantitative underwriting standards used by lenders
when determining whether to grant a loan are the payment-to-income
(PTI) ratio and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

- The PTI ratio is the ratio of monthly payments to monthly income
and measures the ability of the applicant to make monthly payments
(both mortgage and real estate tax payments). The lower this ratio is,
the greater the likelihood that the applicant will be able to meet the
required payments.

- The LTV ratio is the ratio of the amount of the loan to the market (or
appraised) value of the property. The lower this ratio is, the greater the
protection will be for the lender if the applicant defaults on the
payments and the lender must repossess and sell the property.

- Every mortgage loan must be serviced. Servicing of a mortgage
involves collecting monthly payments and forwarding proceeds to

- wners of the loan, sending payment notices to mortgagors, reminding

mortgagors when payments are overdue, maintaining records of

principal balances, administering an escrow balance for real estate taxes

and insurance purposes, initiating foreclosure proceedings if necessary,

and furnishing tax information to mortgagors when applicable.

- The different types of residential mortgages available in countries
that have a mortgage market are classified according to the following
attributes: interest rate type, repayment structure, treatment of
prepayments, lender's recourse, lien status, credit classification, credit
guarantees, and conforming versus nonconforming status.

- The interest rate on a mortgage determines the type of mortgage: a
fixed-rate mortgage, an indexed adjustable-rate mortgage, a reviewable
adjustable-rate mortgage, a rollover (renegotiable) mortgage, a hybrid
mortgage, or a convertible mortgage.

- The method for repaying the principal over time is called the
"repayment structure" and is typically paid monthly.

- A lender would prefer a mortgage where some principal is repaid
- ver the mortgage's term in order to reduce the credit risk it faces when
lending against the property.

- "Amortization" refers to the repayment of the principal borrowed as
part of the monthly loan payment.

- An amortizing mortgage specifies a scheduled payment of principal
that the borrower must make and is typical in most countries.

- With a fully amortizing mortgage, the monthly scheduled principal
payments are such that when all scheduled principal payments are
added up, the total is equal to the original mortgage balance.

- A partial amortizing mortgage is such that the total of the monthly
scheduled principal payments is less than the original mortgage
balance. A balloon payment must then be made at the end of the loan's
term equal to the difference between the amount owed and the total
principal payments.

- A prepayment is the amount of the payment made in excess of the
monthly mortgage payment.

- A prepayment penalty mortgage mitigates the borrower's right to
prepay by imposing a penalty for prepaying.

- With a recourse loan, the lender is entitled to have a claim against the
borrower for the shortfall if a default occurs; with a nonrecourse
mortgage, unless there is some claim of fraud, the lender does not have
a claim against the borrower.

- Whether the lender is entitled to recourse in the case of a shortfall

(default) varies by country. In the United States, all mortgages to

purchase a residence are nonrecourse mortgages.

- The lien status of a mortgage indicates the lender's seniority in the
event of the forced liquidation of the property as a result of the
borrower's default.

- For a mortgage that is a first lien, the lender has a first call on the
proceeds of the liquidation of the property if it were to be repossessed,
whereas for a second lien or junior lien, the lender's claim on the
proceeds in the case of liquidation comes after the first lien lenders are
paid in full.

- In the United States, loans are classified by the creditworthiness of
the borrower: a prime loan is one made to a borrower considered to be

- f high credit quality; a subprime loan is one made to a borrower of
lower credit quality or where the loan is not a first lien on the property;
and an Alternative-A loan (Alt-A loan) is made to a borrower
considered to be of prime creditworthiness but with some attributes that
either increase the borrower's perceived credit riskiness or cause the
borrower to be difficult to categorize and evaluate.

- The applicant's credit score is the primary measure used to
characterize loans as either prime or subprime.

- Mortgages can be classified based on whether there is a third-party
guaranty. The guaranty can be one provided by the national
government, a related entity, or a private entity.

- In the United States, loans that are backed by agencies of the federal
government are referred to under the generic term "government loans"
and are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

   - Loans that have no explicit guaranty from the federal government are
said to be "conventional mortgages."

   - A conventional loan can be insured by a private mortgage insurer.
   - A conforming loan is one that qualifies for purchase by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac so that it can be included in an MBS security that they
issue.

   - When investing in residential mortgage loans, investors are exposed
to credit risk, liquidity risk, price risk, and prepayment risk.

   - The three components of the monthly cash flow from a mortgage are
(1) interest, (2) principal repayment (scheduled principal payment or
amortization), and (3) any prepayment.

   - Prepayment risk is the risk associated with a mortgage's cash flow as
a result of prepayments.

  - Prepayment risk arises because the proceeds received from the
repayment of the loan might have to be reinvested at a lower interest
rate than that currently earned on the proceeds lent to the borrower.

   - Prepayment risk is the same risk faced by an investor in a callable
bond. However, unlike a callable bond, no premium has to be paid by
the borrower in the case of a residential mortgage loan unless it is a
prepayment penalty mortgage.

   - The driving force in the development of a strong secondary market
for residential mortgage loans was asset securitization: the packaging
(or pooling) of loans and the issuance of securities collateralized by
these loans.

```
Appendix: Mortgage Mathematics

```

The amount of the monthly loan payment that represents the repayment of

the principal borrowed is called the **amortization** . Traditionally, both

FRMs and ARMs were **fully amortizing loans** . What this means is that

the monthly mortgage payments made by the borrower are such that they

not only provide the lender with the contractual interest but also are

sufficient to completely repay the amount borrowed when the last monthly

mortgage payment is made. Thus, for example, for a fully amortizing 30year loan, at the end of the 360th month, the last mortgage payment is

sufficient to pay off any loan balance, so that after that last payment, the

amount owed is zero.

```
Fully Amortizing Fixed-Rate Loans

```

Fully amortizing fixed-rate loans have a payment that is constant over the

life of the loan. For example, suppose a loan has an original balance of

\$200,000, a note rate of 7.5%, and a term of 30 years. Then the monthly

mortgage payment would be \$1,398.43. The formula for calculating the

monthly mortgage payment is

where _MP_ = monthly mortgage payment ($),

_MB_ 0 = original mortgage balance ($),

_i_ = note rate divided by 12 (in decimal),

_n_

= number of months of the mortgage loan.

For example, suppose that

_MB_ 0 = \$200,000, _i_ = 0.075/12 = 0.00625, and _n_ = 360.

Then the monthly payment is

To calculate the remaining mortgage balance at the end of any month, the

following formula is used:

where _MBt_ = mortgage balance after _t_ months.

For example, suppose that for month 12 ( _t_ = 12) we have:

## MB 0 = \$200,000; i = 0.00625; and n = 360.

The mortgage balance at the end of month 12 is

To calculate the portion of the monthly mortgage payment that is the

scheduled principal payment for a month, the following formula is used:

where _SPt_ = scheduled principal repayment for month _t._

For example, suppose that for month 12 ( _t_ = 12) we have:

Then the schedule principal repayment for month 12 is

Assuming that the borrower has made all monthly payments on a timely

basis, then, after the last monthly mortgage payment is made, the

- utstanding balance is zero (i.e., the loan is paid off). This can be seen in the
schedule shown in table A29.1, which is referred to as an **amortization**
**schedule** . (Not all 360 months are shown, to conserve space.) The column
labeled "Principal Repayment" is the monthly amortization of the loan.
Notice that in the 360th month, the ending balance is zero. Also note that in
each month, the amount of the monthly mortgage payment applied to interest

declines. This is because the amount of the outstanding balance declines

each month.

Adjustable-Rate Mortgage

```

In the case of an ARM, the monthly mortgage payment adjusts periodically.

Thus, the monthly mortgage payments must be recalculated at each reset

date. This process of resetting the mortgage loan payment is referred to as

**recasting the loan** . For example, consider once again a \$200,000, 30-year

loan. Assume that the loan adjusts annually and that the initial note rate (i.e.,

the note rate for the first 12 months) is 7.5%. How much of the loan will be

- utstanding at the end of one year? We can determine this from table A29.1
by looking at the last column ("Ending Balance") for month 12. That amount
is \$198,156.33. (Alternatively, the formula given above can be used.) Now
recasting the loan involves computing the monthly mortgage payment that
will fully amortize a loan of \$198,156.33 for 29 years (348 months), because
after one year there are 29 years remaining on the loan. The note rate used is
the reset rate. Suppose that the reset rate is 8.5%. Then the monthly
mortgage payment to fully amortize the loan is \$1,535.26, which is the
monthly mortgage payment for the next 12 months.

```
Interest-Only Mortgage

```

A mortgage that involves the payment of only interest and no principal for

part of the life of the mortgage is an interest-only mortgage. With this type

- f loan, only interest is paid for a predetermined period, called the **lockout**
**period** . After the lockout period, the loan is recast such that the monthly
mortgage payments will be sufficient to fully amortize the original amount

- f the loan over the remaining term of the loan. The interest-only product
can be an FRM, an ARM, or a hybrid ARM.

For example, consider a \$200,000, 30-year interest-only loan with a

lockout period of five years and a note rate of 7.5% (i.e., an FRM). For the

first 60 months, the monthly mortgage payment is only the monthly interest,

which is $1,250 (7.5% × $200,000/12). In the 61st month, the monthly

mortgage payment must include both interest and amortization (principal

repayment). The monthly mortgage payment for the remaining life of the

mortgage loan is the payment necessary to fully amortize a \$200,000 25-year

loan with a note rate of 7.5%. That monthly mortgage payment is \$1,477.98.

Note that if the mortgage had been a 30-year fixed-rate loan at 7.5%, the

monthly mortgage payment for the first five years would have been

\$1,398.43 instead of \$1,200 for the interest-only loan. This is the appealing

feature of the interest-only loan. The homeowner can purchase a more

expensive home using an interest-only loan. The disadvantage for the

homeowner is that for the remaining term of the loan, the interest-only

mortgage requires a higher monthly mortgage payment (\$1,477.98) than

would a 30-year fully amortizing loan (\$1,398.43). However, if the

homeowner anticipates a rise in income, this could more than offset the

impact of the higher monthly mortgage payment. From the lender's

perspective, however, there is greater credit risk. This is because at the end

- f five years, the lender's exposure remains at \$200,000 rather than being
reduced by the amortization over the lockout period.

Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you will understand:

   - the process of securitizing residential mortgage loans;
  - what is meant by prepayment risk, and how prepayments are
measured;

   - the different sectors in the residential mortgage-backed securities
market: agency and private label;

   - the different types of agency mortgage-backed securities and their
investment characteristics: pass-through securities, collateralized
mortgage obligations, and stripped mortgage-backed securities;

   - the motivation for the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations
and the different types of tranches/bond classes;

  - how tranches with different prepayment risks are created in a
collateralized mortgage obligation;

   - the difference between prime and subprime residential mortgagebacked securities;
   - the subprime crisis in 2007.

As explained in chapter 29, investing in residential mortgage loans exposes

the investor to default risk, price risk, liquidity risk, and prepayment risk. A

more efficient way to participate in this market is to invest in a security that

is backed by a pool of these loans. This type of security is created by

applying the same securitization technology described in chapter 27 for

creating an asset-backed security (ABS). A residential mortgage loan used as

collateral to create the security is said to be "securitized." The general term

for a security created through the securitization technology process where

the security is backed by a real-estate related mortgage loan is called a

**mortgage-backed security** (MBS). More specifically, an MBS is a security

created when one or more holders of mortgage loans form a collection (pool)

- f loans and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool. A pool may
consist of several thousand loans or only a few. Risk-averse investors prefer
investing in a pool to investing in a single mortgage, partly because a
mortgage pass-through security is considerably more liquid than for an
individual mortgage.

Two sectors are classified in the MBS market, based on whether the loan

securities are for residential mortgage loans or for commercial mortgage

loans. We discussed residential mortgage loans in chapter 29, and we

describe commercial mortgage loans in chapter 31. An MBS backed by

residential mortgage loans is called a **residential mortgage-backed security**

(RMBS), and this market is the subject of this chapter. An MBS backed by

commercial mortgage loans is called a **commercial mortgage-backed**

**security** (CMBS) and is covered in chapter 31, where we describe the

commercial real-estate market.

As explained in chapter 29, the residential mortgage market can be

divided into two subsectors based on the credit quality of the borrower: the

prime mortgage market and the subprime mortgage market. The former

sector includes (1) loans that satisfy the underwriting standards of the

Government National Mortgage Association (known as "Ginnie Mae"),

Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac (i.e., conforming loans) and (2) those that fail

to conform for a reason other than credit quality, or if the loan is not a first

lien on the property. The subprime mortgage sector is the market for loans

provided to borrowers with an impaired credit rating or for whom the loan is

a second lien.

The RMBS market is divided into two sectors based on the characteristics

- f the loan. As explained in chapter 29, a conforming loan is one that
satisfies the underwriting standard of the agencies. An RMBS that uses
conforming loans is called an **agency RMBS** . Noncomforming loans can
also be used to create an RMBS, and a security using such loans is referred
to as a **private-label RMBS** - r a **nonagency RMBS** . In turn, the privatelabel RMBS historically has been further classified on whether the collateral
for the security is composed of prime residential mortgage loans or subprime
residential mortgage loans, which we described in chapter 29. An RMBS
backed by the latter are referred to as a **subprime RMBS** .

This chapter is divided into two major sections. The first is the agency

RMBS market, and the second is the private-label RMBS market.

```
Agency RMBS Market

```

The agency RMBS market is the largest sector of the U.S. investment-grade

market. That is, of all securities that have an investment-grade rating (a

category that includes U.S. Treasury securities), the agency RMBS market

has been the largest sector. The size of this sector has varied from 35% to

45% of the investment-grade market since 2000.

The agency MBS market includes three types of securities: agency

mortgage pass-through securities, agency collateralized mortgage

- bligations (CMOs), and agency stripped MBS. As we explain below,
agency stripped MBS and agency CMOs are created from mortgage passthrough securities. Agency MBSs are the subject of this section.

```
Agency Pass-Through Securities

```

The cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security depends on the cash flow

- f the underlying mortgage loans. As explained in chapter 29, the cash flow
consists of monthly mortgage payments representing interest, the scheduled
repayment of principal, and any prepayments.

Payments are made to security holders each month. The amounts and the

timing of the cash flow from the pool of mortgages and the cash flow passed

through to investors, however, are not identical. The monthly cash flow for a

pass-through security is less than the monthly cash flow of the underlying

mortgages by an amount equal to the servicing and other fees. The other fees

are those charged by the issuer or guarantor of the pass-through security for

guaranteeing the issue (discussed later).

The timing of the cash flow also differs. The monthly mortgage payment

is due from each mortgagor on the first day of each month, but a delay

affects the passing through of the corresponding monthly cash flow to the

security holders. The length of the delay varies by the type of pass-through

security.

Figure 30.1 illustrates the process of creating a mortgage pass-through

security.

```
Figure 30.1

Creation of a mortgage pass-through security.

**`Issuers of agency pass-through securities`** Agency pass-through
securities are issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. These
three entities were created by Congress to increase the supply of capital to
the residential mortgage market and to provide support for an active
secondary market.

**`Ginnie Mae`** Ginnie Mae is a federally related institution, because it is part

- f the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result, the passthrough securities that it guarantees carry the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government with respect to timely payment of both interest and principal.

That is, the interest and principal are paid when due even if mortgagors fail

to make their monthly mortgage payment. The security guaranteed by

Ginnie Mae is an MBS.

Although Ginnie Mae provides the guarantee, it is not the issuer. Passthrough securities that carry its guarantee and bear its name are issued by

lenders it approves, such as thrifts, commercial banks, and mortgage

bankers. These lenders receive approval only if the underlying loans satisfy

the underwriting standards established by Ginnie Mae. When it guarantees

securities issued by approved lenders, Ginnie Mae permits these lenders to

convert illiquid individual loans into liquid securities backed by the U.S.

government. In the process, Ginnie Mae accomplishes its goal of supplying

funds to the residential mortgage market and providing an active secondary

market. For the guarantee, Ginnie Mae receives a fee, called the "guaranty

fee."

**`Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac`** As explained at the end of chapter 29, the
mission of these two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is to support
the liquidity and stability of the mortgage market. They accomplish this by
(1) buying and selling mortgages, (2) creating pass-through securities and
guaranteeing them, and (3) buying MBSs. The mortgages purchased and
held as investments by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are held in a portfolio
referred to as the **retained portfolio** . However, the MBSs that they issue are
not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Instead,
the payments to investors in the MBSs are secured first by the cash flow
from the underlying pool of loans and then by a corporate guarantee. That
corporate guarantee, however, is the same as the corporate guarantee to the

- ther creditors of the two GSEs. As with Ginnie Mae, the two GSEs receive
a guaranty fee for taking on the credit risk associated with borrowers failing
to satisfy their loan obligations.

Although the securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are

referred to in this chapter as "agency MBSs," they are also referred to as

"conventional pass-through securities." This is because the collateral is

typically conventional loans that conform to the underwriting standards of

these two GSEs, as explained in chapter 29.

The pass-through securities issued by Fannie Mae are referred to as

"MBSs"; Freddie Mac uses the term **participation certificate** (PC) to

describe its pass-through security. All Fannie Mae MBSs are guaranteed

with respect to the timely payment of interest and principal. Although the

PCs that Freddie Mac now issues carry the same guarantee, there are some

- utstanding PCs that guarantee the timely payment of interest but the
eventual return of principal within one year of the due date.

**`Prepayment risks associated with pass-through securities`** An
investor who owns pass-through securities does not know what the cash flow
will be, because the cash flow depends on prepayments. The risk associated
with prepayments is called **prepayment risk** .

To understand prepayment risk, consider the following example. Suppose

an investor buys a 7.5% coupon Ginnie Mae at a time when the mortgage

rates are 7.5%. What will happen to prepayments if mortgage rates decline

to, say, 5.5%? Homeowners will have the incentive to prepay all or part of

their loan. Thus, the investor must reinvest the proceeds received at a lower

interest rate. The second adverse consequence is that appreciation potential

- f the pass-through security is limited. With a decline in interest rates, the
price of an option-free bond (such as a Treasury bond) will rise. In the case

- f a pass-through security, the rise in price will not be as large as that of an
- ption-free bond because a fall in interest rates increases the probability that
the market rate will fall below the rate at which the borrower is paying. This
fall in rates gives the borrower an incentive to prepay the loan and refinance
the debt at a lower rate. To the extent that this happens, the security holder
will be repaid not at a price incorporating the premium but at par value. The
holder risks capital loss, which reflects the fact that the anticipated
reimbursements at par will not yield the initial cash flow.

The adverse consequences when mortgage rates decline are the same as

those faced by holders of callable corporate and municipal bonds. As in the

case of those instruments, the upside price potential of a pass-through

security is truncated because of prepayments. This result should not be

surprising, because a mortgage loan effectively grants the borrower the right

to call the loan at par value. The adverse consequence when mortgage rates

decline is referred to as **contraction risk** .
