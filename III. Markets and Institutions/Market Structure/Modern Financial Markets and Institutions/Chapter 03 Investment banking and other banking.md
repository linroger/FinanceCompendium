# Investment banking and other banking

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

Banking is now a term that covers a surprisingly complex and intellectually rich range of activities. This chapter explains some of that diversity so that the reader might have a sounder grasp of the important functions performed by bankers. By the end of this chapter the reader should be able to: describe the wide variety of activities undertaken by investment bankers;

explain the nature and significance of international banking in the modern world;

- outline the important roles taken on by the banks set up as mutual organisations;

- discuss the nature of hire purchase, leasing and factoring businesses conducted by finance houses; describe Islamic banking and outline how it differs from conventional banking.

Most of us do not encounter investment banks in our daily lives. Despite them operating in the background, working with companies, governments and other large organisations they are highly influential. The extent of their importance was harshly brought home with the financial crisis of 2008. Even those of us who work in the field of finance had hardly heard of US sub-prime mortgages or the repackaging of these mortgages into bonds issued by investment bankers, let alone the repackaging of the repackaged bonds. And yet all this financial engineering led to a calamity with enormous implications for all of us.

The greedy repackaging of financial claims is to look on the dark side of the role of investment banks; their bread-and-butter jobs are far more down to earth and far more useful. For example, executives go to investment bankers when contemplating a once-in-a-career corporate move, such as buying another company. They lack the knowledge and skill set themselves to be able to cope with the regulations, the raising of finance or the tactics to be employed, so they turn to the specialists at the bank who regularly undertake these tasks for client companies. Another area where executives need specialist help is in raising money by selling bonds or shares. The sums raised can be in the tens or hundreds of millions, and all the details have to be right if investors are to be enticed and the regulators satisfied. Investment bankers also assist companies in managing their risks. For example, they may advise a mining company on the use of derivatives to reduce the risk of commodity prices moving adversely, or interest rates, or currency rates. Then there are their roles in assisting the workings of the financial markets, acting as brokers, market makers and fund managers. The list of people they help is long, despite most of us being unaware of their activities.

The chapter moves on to discuss a number of other types of banking. With increased liberalisation of financial systems, banking has globalised, with foreign banks becoming increasingly important in domestic systems; we thus look at international banking. Then, alongside banks set up as shareholder-owned companies, we have other types of organisation conducting banking-type activities. For example, there are a number of mutually owned (owned by their customers) entities that invite deposits, make loans and participate in the payment system. These include building societies, savings and loans and cooperative banks.

When people or businesses obtain an asset through hire purchase or leasing, the obligations under the agreement are in many ways similar to those of a bank loan. These are certainly considered alternative ways of borrowing money and so can be included under banking. Indeed, most of the large finance houses that operate in these areas are, in fact, subsidiaries of the major banks. Finally, this chapter highlights the differences between conventional banking and Islamic banking.

## Investment banking

Investment banks are complex organisations selling a wide range of services as well as trading securities for their own profit. Not all of them are active in the full range discussed below; many are content to specialise in certain services or trading areas. It is important to note that of the services they offer companies and governments, many are regarded as loss-leaders (e.g. analysis of company shares, or even lending by the bank to companies) so that they can engage with potential clients over a long period of time, gain their trust and then offer highly lucrative services when the company makes a major move such as the takeover of another company. Thus, for investment banks to maximise profits they need to be very good at coordinating their various activities so that they can sell a number of different services to a client company or government.

It is people who form relationships rather than organisations, so investment banks need talented employees who can form strong bonds with clients. Such talent is expensive, especially once they have some leverage with their employers because the client executives trust them as individuals, rather than the bank, to help them with, say, a rights issue – there is always the possibility of an investment banker taking his client contact list with him to another employer. This partly explains the high bonus culture at investment banks. Then, on the trading side, the talented individuals who make good bets on the movements of securities, commodities, exchange rates, etc. can also command high bonuses. Investment banks typically put aside around 50 per cent of income for employee compensation (salary + bonuses etc.). Just to give you some idea, the average compensation and benefits for each Goldman Sachs employee in 2010 was  $430,000: at the investment bank arm of JP Morgan Chase it was $369,651. See Exhibit 3.1 to gain some idea of more general pay in the sector – these are the rates after they made a major contribution to the financial crisis! (VP = vice president of a section, MD = managing director of a section – they tend to have a lot of VPs and MDs.) There are now new rules in the major economies limiting the amount that can be taken as cash to less than 30 per cent of the bonus, with the rest payable over five years or so in shares. This is an attempt to align the interests of the bankers with the long-term interests of their shareholders and wider society. It was felt that they had been focusing on short-term gains and taking high risks to do it so that they could get a large bonus – if it all went wrong then the government would bail them out, they reasoned. And anyway, after a year or two of high bonuses they already had the house in Mayfair and a bulging Swiss bank account.

But then there is the question of why investment banks generate such high profits to be able to pay bonuses in the first place. One place to look would be the small number of players in the field with high reputations for handling complex financing and deals – corporate executives are often willing to pay a great deal for what they perceive as the 'best'. On the investing side, when contemplating whether to invest some money, institutions often look for a big-name investment bank's stamp of approval of a firm issuing new securities (e.g. shares) or committing to a merger deal – the big names will refuse to handle an issue of shares or bonds for a company if there is a real risk of the issue upsetting investors by subsequently underperforming. The industry looks very much like an oligopoly in many areas of activity – for some services there may be a choice of only three banks in the world. Lord Myners, who has decades of experience in the City before becoming a government minister, is certainly suspicious – see Exhibit 3.2.

Exhibit 3.3 discusses the difficulties of introducing more competition into investment banking. Any new entrant that tried to challenge the current leaders would need large amounts of capital to be able to do the deals that clients expect. They would also need to attract the best employees, those capable of inspiring confidence and maintaining a long-term relationship of trust with corporate executives, offering exceptional expertise. They would need to offer the broad range of services that multinational corporate clients now expect. These barriers to entry are considered so strong that they rarely allow a newcomer to seriously attack the market shares of the leaders.

Another place to look for an explanation for the exceptional profits is the extent of the variety of tasks undertaken by the banks – perhaps they gain some special advantage in doing so many different things for other traders, for investors or for companies. So, while helping a company

#### Pressure rises for formal bank fees inquiry

Political pressure for a formal inquiry into investment banking fees mounted yesterday as Lord Myners, City minister, said there was clear evidence of restricted competition in the market.

"Certain aspects of investment banking in equity underwriting exhibit features of a semi-oligopolistic market," Lord Myners told the Financial Times.

His comments come less than a week after the Office of Fair Trading revealed it was looking at the fees charged by investment banks to decide whether to launch a formal probe.

Lord Myners told an international audience of shareholders at the International Corporate Governance Network yesterday that he welcomed the OFT's focus on this area.

He is understood privately to be encouraging the OFT not to drop the issue. But he also urged investment institutions as the users of investment banking services to launch their own public probe into fees "to test whether … vital capital-raising activity is the product of sufficient capital intensity".

He criticised institutional investors for complaining about the rising fees but doing "little or nothing about it themselves - they have, for the most part, acquiesced".

He told the FT: "Here is a real opportunity for investment managers to show they are acting on behalf of their clients and launch an inquiry."

Lord Myners spoke out following shareholder complaints to ministers asking for government reviews. The Association of British Insurers wrote to Lord Mandelson, business secretary, this week calling on him to add his weight to pressure on companies to clamp down on fees paid to banks.

The "enormous" fees paid to investment banks for advising companies on deals might be skewing the outcome of takeovers, the ABI letter warned, and acted as a "deadweight cost" on shareholders that could swallow part of savings derived from mergers and acquisitions.

Lord Myners said yesterday it was clear investment banks had profited from raising margins on trading and intermediating between companies and investors in capital markets.

"The rents attracted for intermediation appear on the face of it to be high for the value added of the risk taken," he said.

He noted that while banks were charging higher fees for assuring companies that a share issue went well, they have reduced their own risks by advising companies to issue shares at a discount and warming up investors to the issue in advance.

Lord Myners said that if shareholders launched their own inquiry into equity underwriting, institutional investors would "head off the charge that some investment managers are unwilling to challenge existing practices or pricing because their relationship with investment banks is too cosy".

Lindsay Tomlinson, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: "Shareholders are extremely vexed about fees charged by banks for equity issues and mergers and acquisitions, but whether they would set up their own probe is another matter."

### Exhibit 3.3

#### Outsized risk and regulation inhibit entrants

In all the furore over bankers' bonuses and bulging bank profits in recent months, one big question seems to have been forgotten: why is it that banks make so much money in the first place? Why does a Goldman Sachs rack up a return on equity of 22 per cent, when a BP makes 17 per cent, or a Pfizer makes 12 per cent - especially when so many of the now booming banks were at least partly responsible for the financial crisis? Is there a cartel in investment banking, as the UK's Office of Fair Trading last week implied?

The titans of Wall Street and the City of London have long seemed unassailable, that is for sure. The need for vast amounts of capital, a strong enough brand to attract staff and a compelling enough suite of products and services to draw customers has proved too big an obstacle for all but a tiny clutch of challengers. If Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank have been winners, their number is dwarfed by the losers. The still-trying category stretches from France

(Crédit Agricole, Natixis) to Japan (Nomura, Mizuho).

"The barriers to entry have always been pretty high," says Rob Shafir, who heads Credit Suisse in the Americas. "It takes years to build the technology, the human capital, and make the client investment."

But as politicians and regulators have grown increasingly uneasy with the size and scale of established banks - urging for balance sheets to be shrunk and universal banks to be broken up - surely now is the perfect time for new entrants to triumph.

There is certainly space for more players, bankers admit. "In the old days, before the financial crisis, there were 14 or 15 firms," says Colm Kelleher, co-head of Morgan Stanley's investment banking operations. "Now there are seven or eight. So perversely you've ended up with less competition." The investment banking chief of one European bank agrees. "Our industry is too consolidated, it is frightening," he confesses, before adding gleefully: "[Profit] margins in this business are fantastic."

Sure enough, last year was a bumper one for the earnings of investment banks that were not still swamped by the financial crisis. A combination of low interest rates, vanished giants (Lehman and Bear Stearns) and others weakened by toxic asset problems (Citigroup, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland) left the likes of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and BarCap to profit exponentially from inflated margins and booming demand from return-hungry investors.

Yet, according to the consensus views of lawyers, bankers and regulators, no matter how desirable or logical it might be to see stiffer competition, and the break-up of what many see as a global oligopoly, the odds of that happening have ironically widened. It is one of the unintended consequences of the post-crisis world that as regulators seek to make the financial sector sofer, they are also insulating it from fresh competition.

"We'd love to have smarter competitors," says one Wall Street boss. "But every time they ratchet up the regulations, it gets tougher."

Already regulatory authorities around the world have told banks they need to beef up their holdings of liquid funds, and the international architects of bank supervision, the Basel committee, are drawing up tougher rules governing how much capital must underpin riskier activities.

If analysts are right, the ramp-up in regulation will have an effect on banks' return on equity - cutting it from a range of 15-25 per cent to perhaps 5-15 per cent. But it will make breaking into the industry more demanding.

"The structural barriers are certainly higher than they were," says David Weaver, president of Jefferies International. "But it's not only regulatory capital that has got more demanding. If you're a lender, in these markets, you have to step up and provide capital on your balance sheet - the syndication market just isn't there."

That means life has become harder for smaller operators without the appetite to take outsized risks.

Even without tougher regulation, it has proved next to impossible to crack Wall Street without a significant acquisition. Nomura is trying just that - and for the fifth time. Having bought the European and Asian assets of the defunct Lehman Brothers, it is now seeking to build out a US operation to match - so far with limited success.

Even HSBC, which boasts one of the most powerful brands internationally, threw in the towel in 2006 and backed away from John Studzinski's aggressive three-year expansion plan. Executives say it was impossible to compete with rivals that had a greater appetite for risk, particularly when it came to backing transactions with balance sheet lending, or to break down their historic relationships with clients.

Hard as the Wall Street challenge is, there have nonetheless been striking changes of market share within the clique. Even banks that have thrived – such as Goldman Sachs – have lost out in some areas. A few years ago Goldman and Morgan Stanley controlled two-thirds of the prime brokerage market – the business of supplying finance and custody to hedge funds. Over the past 18 months, the likes of Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have stolen large amounts of that business, as hedge funds concluded, after the failure of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, that they should have relationships with more than just one bank.

There is also plenty of evidence of fresh competition in merger and acquisition advisory work, where virtually the only requirement for starting up in business is a contact book and a decent reputation - hence the profusion of advisory boutiques that spring up every year.

But if a typical company uses three or four advisers on a deal, only one of them would ever be a boutique, mainly because the company is often desperate for the lending capacity that only bulge-bracket banks can provide.

"It's a very, very competitive world out there," says one Wall Street M&A boss. "But there's a finite slice of the pie going to boutiques."

The big hope for those banks outside the bulge bracket is to find profitable niches. HSBC, for example, has retrenched to focus on servicing its core corporate clients, with a bent towards emerging markets.

"If you want to be everywhere in Europe, Asia, the US, it's true that the barriers are very high," agrees Sergio Ermotti, head of investment banking at Italy's Unicredit. "But our focus is on Europe and there we have big opportunities."

issue bonds they might also act as a market maker in the bond market and provide research to clients. They might also be dealing in that company's shares and acting as a broker for its derivatives trades, while selling its commercial paper, managing its foreign exchange deals and buying commodities for it. They might also be running large investment funds for pension funds and other investors. Like spiders at the centre of information webs, they can detect movements long before others and are in a position to benefit themselves from that superior knowledge. How much of this 'special knowledge' tips over into conflict-of-interest territory (or even insider dealing) is difficult for us to know, but some people suspect that quite a lot of it does - see Exhibit 3.4.

# Exhibit 3.4

# Conflicts of interest bubble beneath the surface

FT

The vexed question of potential conflicts of interest between investment banks and their corporate clients has been laid bare by Citigroup's role in Terra Firma's  $\S 4\mathrm{bn}$  acquisition of EMI.

Citigroup not only served as adviser, lender and broker to EMI, but it was also the sole financier to Terra Firma.

"Citi's increasing involvement with EMI in many areas led to inherent conflicts, set Citi up to broker the private equity deal that is at the heart of this action," Terra Firma's lawsuit claims.

However, by their very nature, integrated investment banks are inherently conflicted.

Their aim is to sell companies as many products and services as possible and package them together to maximise a greater "share of wallet".

By providing companies with multiple products and services - from advising on deals and financing them to hedging the related interest rate and currency exposure, and refinancing the debt when the deal closes - a bank can squeeze substantial fees from just one company.

Terra Firma claims, in its lawsuit, that its relationship with Citi was "highly lucrative" for the bank. Citi not only received  $\S 92.5\mathrm{m}$  in fees for its multiple capacities on the EMI deal, but also raked in more than  $\S 135\mathrm{m}$  between 2000 and 2007 for providing Terra Firma with advice and/or financing in connection with almost 20 transactions worth  $\S 57\mathrm{bn}$  ( $\S 35\mathrm{bn}$ ).

According to the lawsuit, it seems that some EMI executives were worried that Citi was using the same bankers that had previously worked on the renegotiation of EMI's credit facilities and as a result had access to confidential EMI information, to also arrange the debt financing package for Terra Firma's acquisition.

This, Terra Firma argues, suggests that Citigroup had more knowledge about EMI than it did, and would have therefore known what the business was valued. Citi denies this.

Usually, such arrangements do not cause a problem unless a client complains.

In 2006, for example, during Linde's €12bn (£10.8bn) takeover of BOC Group, the UK gases company asked Deutsche to step aside as its broker because of the German banks's multiple roles in the transaction.

Deutsche owned 10 per cent of Linde, was providing it with financing and the bank's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, was also a member of Linde's supervisory board. But when a client is not worried about the thorny issues of potential conflicts, the banks can put all their services into play.

That can even involve a bank co-investing alongside their client in a deal - a strategy Terra Firma should be familiar with.

Four years ago, Citigroup not only provided Terra Firma with the equity, mezzanine debt and advisory service to back the  $\S 7\mathrm{bn}$  buy-out of

Viterra, the real estate arm of Eon, but the US bank invested alongside its client in the deal.

This approach - known as the "triple play" in the industry - works until the banks start competing with their clients for an asset.

The more principal money the banks have to invest, the greater the chances of a conflict, which is what happened at the height of the debt boom.

One of the most controversial examples took place in 2006 when Goldman Sachs, having offered to advise airports operator BAA against a hostile bid from Ferrovial, put together its own bidding consortium for the UK airports operator.

The move caused Hank Paulson, Goldman's then chief executive, to publicly reinforce the bank's policy of not investing as a principal in the takeover of a public company without a board recommendation.

The BAA saga also highlighted the challenges banks faced during the recent private equity bidding frenzy of maintaining competitive tension in auctions and keeping potential bidders enthusiastic for as long as possible.

As in any deal, would-be buyers hope to underpay, but it is the job of the sellside bank to bankers running the auctions to get the best deal for the vendors while imposing some discipline on the sale.

One of the favoured tactics of ensuring this is the "dual track" - whereby an asset is sold via

# Exhibit 3.4 continued an auction and prepared for a potential initial public offering at the same time.

This creates pricing tension between the institutional and retail investor base of the company for sale and the private equity buyers, and usually results in the latter increasing their bids at the last minute.

But while auctions can be an effective way to get the best price for a business, it is not necessarily a victory to win one.

A generation ago we had merchant banks operating in the UK and a few other countries, now they have been relabelled as investment banks following the US nomenclature. In modern usage (i.e. US influenced) merchant banking is sometimes used for the subset of investment banking activities concerned with using the bank's capital to facilitate a transaction such as engaging in mergers and acquisitions.

The balance sheet of an investment bank is somewhat different to that of a commercial bank. Investment banks do not (generally) hold retail deposits – unless they are part of a universal bank, of course. Their liabilities come in the form of promises to pay on securities such as bonds or short-term wholesale money market instruments – they would also be using money placed in the company by shareholders (or by partners in a partnership – some investment banks are still partnerships rather than companies). Most of the money lent to investment banks is for repayment at a fixed date in the future and so they are less vulnerable to the risk of unforeseen withdrawals than retail banks, thus they hold little money in a truly liquid form. However, their reliance on wholesale market funding makes them vulnerable to a loss of confidence in the money and bond markets, leading to a lenders' strike – the bank may have to pay off old loans as per the original agreement but not be able to replace the money by borrowing again. This happened a lot in 2008 and 2009.

Instead of holding deposits with the central bank, investment banks tend to place cash at the retail banks or buy money market instruments if they have a temporary surplus of cash.

### Global investment banks

Bulge bracket investment banks are those that are regarded as the leaders. They are dominant in key activities such as assisting corporations with bond and equity issuance, underwriting and mergers and acquisition, particularly for larger companies. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Capital are examples of bulge bracket firms. Global banks are those active in a number of countries. The US investment banks became very large in the US between the 1930s and the 1990s because after the Great Depression US banks could become either commercial banks or investment banks but not both. Investment banks were not allowed to take deposits but they were allowed to assist with the issuance of securities, underwriting, securities dealing and other market-related activities. Commercial banks could take deposits and lend but were restricted in their business activities; in particular they were not to engage in underwriting and trading of securities.

Thus, as corporations grew and realised they needed investment banking-type services, they went to the few Wall Street investment banks that dominated the scene. In addition, the US is an economy that is very much oriented to financial markets when it comes to raising finance – much more so than, say, Europe, where bank loans and equity investments by banks into companies are much more normal. Thus, the US developed enormous bond markets (corporate, local authority, government) and enormous equity markets, and at the heart of these markets grew a handful of investment banks. As countries around the world reduced the restrictions inhibiting cross-border banking over the last three decades, the US investment banks became dominant in many other countries, too. They bought up many of the local operators and integrated them into a global operation, leading to more economies of scale and even greater dominance. Having said that, the Americans do not have it all their own way – there are some other large investment banks around, e.g. Barclays of the UK, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Deutsche Bank of Germany, Nomura and Daiwa Securities of Japan.

There are two main types of investment bank today. First, there are the huge, global banks that perform the wide variety of functions described in this chapter. Second, there are much smaller outfits that specialise in particular areas. Thus you might have a boutique investment bank that simply advises companies on financing issues and mergers but does not raise finance for the firm, or underwrite, or engage in securities trading. Rothschild and Lazard are two of the more established names, which, while not exactly boutique, do have fewer potential conflicts of interest as they concentrate on advice and do not undertake secondary market trading or many other aspects of the securities business conducted by the global investment banks. Occasionally boutiques get bought up by the global banks – see Exhibit 3.5 for an example.

#### Nomura takeover of Tricorn will see reversal of flight to boutiques

Nomura, the Japanese investment bank, is set to buy Tricorn Partners, the London-based corporate finance advisory firm, in a move that will see a reversal of the recent trend for bankers to leave large institutions for smaller, independent boutiques.

Guy Dawson and Justin Dowley, who have run Tricorn since leaving Merrill Lynch seven years ago, will join Nomura as vice-chairmen of Europe, Middle East and Africa investment banking with a mandate to build the Japanese bank's relationships with UK boardrooms.

The acquisition price has not been disclosed but part of the amount that Nomura will pay for Tricorn will depend on earnings that the bankers generate over the next two years.

The acquisition comes during a boom for advisory boutiques which have been able to hire senior bankers on the promise of better pay and healthy dealflow. Mr Dawson and Mr Dowley, whose careers have included the roles of co-heads of European investment banking at Merrill Lynch, have close relationships with several FTSE companies, including Unilever; 3i, Standard Chartered and Travis Perkins.

Nomura has been looking to build its European investment banking franchise following its acquisition of Lehman Brothers' European and Asian M&A and equities business in September last year. That deal triggered the defection of several senior London-based bankers including Michael Tory, who ran UK investment banking.

Mr Dawson and Mr Dowley will also focus on boosting Nomura's roster of corporate broking clients which currently stands at only eight, including four FTSE 100 companies: Tesco, the London Stock Exchange, Legal & General and Invensys.

### Corporate and government assistance

### Advice on financing and raising finance

A corporation reaching the point when it needs to raise capital from outside the firm (i.e. not rely on retained profits) faces a dizzying array of alternative types of finance and ways of raising that finance, from a syndicate bank loan to a bond to selling new shares. Investment banks can advise on the advantages and disadvantages of each and suggest paths to take.

Furthermore, the bank often has the knowledge, contacts and reputation to be able to bring a company needing finance to potential investors. They can help price a new issue of bonds or shares, having awareness of market conditions. They can assist in selling those securities, often roping in a number of other financial institutions to have greater impact in attracting investors. They know the legal and regulatory hurdles that have to be stepped over or manoeuvred around. They will also underwrite new security issues – guaranteeing to buy any not purchased by other investors. Just to confuse everybody the Americans commonly refer to the entire process of organising an equity or bond issue on behalf of a firm as 'underwriting', even though true underwriting (the guarantee of a sale) is only a part of it. To confuse even more: the US (and some other countries') investment bankers describe the process of 'underwriting' shares or bonds as meaning that the investment bank purchases the entire issue at an agreed price and then resells it in the market. In the UK and elsewhere the bank does not usually buy and then sell, but merely ensures that it will be sold.

Investment banks help with initial public offerings (IPOs), when a company issues shares on the stock market for the first time. The investment bank will coordinate the whole process, advise on price and try to find buyers for the shares. When underwriting, it usually gets other institutions to take most of the underwriting risk for a fee. Total underwriting fees are typically 6-7 per cent in the US and 3-4 per cent in Europe. There is more on IPOs in Chapter 9.

Investment banks also assist with seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), the issue of new shares for a company already listed or publicly traded on the exchange, also called follow-on offerings. This may be through a rights issue in which the existing shareholders are offered the new shares in proportion to the percentage of the shares issued that each investor already holds, thus an investor that has 4 per cent of the ordinary shares will be offered 4 per cent of the new shares. Again, the investment bank(s) will charge fees for many services, including advice, finding buyers and underwriting. There is a lot more on rights issues and other types of SEOs in Chapter 9.

Corporations are frequently attracted to the idea of raising money by selling a bond; they can often be sold with a lower rate of interest than that charged on a bank loan, and the restrictions placed on managerial action and demand for collateral can be less. Bond issuance, like share issuance, is an infrequent event for the typical firm (or local authority, or some governments) and so the directors are unfamiliar with the rules and regulations, the process and the methods of attracting buyers. Investment banks, for a fee, can help in these areas. Also, investment banks have high reputations among the investing institutions which buy bonds, thus they have more credibility when it comes to selling securities than would a company doing it on its own. Bond sales are usually underwritten by the bank (and sub-underwriters who work with the bank). Chapter 6 is devoted to the bond market.

Companies often need to raise shortand medium-term finance through the issue of financial instruments such as commercial paper and medium-term notes: investment banks stand ready to help them – for a fee, of course. There are also many other types of finance investment banks advise on and assist companies with, including project finance, sale and leaseback (in which the firm sells an asset, say a building and then rents it back so it can continue to use it), preference shares, convertible bonds (see Chapter 6).

The origin of many investment (merchant) banks was as providers of services to assist overseas trade in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Importers and exporters have always been nervous about trading with each other. Goods are sent to a foreign country with a different legal system and payment is made months later. This exposes the exporter to all kinds of risk, from the importer simply not paying to running out of money before being paid and currencies moving adversely. One way of reducing risk is for the exporter to get the importer to sign a document guaranteeing that in, say, 90 days it will pay  \$1m, for example, to the holder of the document. In most cases the exporter does not even have to wait 90 days; it can sell the right to receive\$ 1 million in a discount market (run by investment banks) and then the purchaser of the bill can collect the 1 millionthis is the bill of exchange market, discussed in Chapter 5. The risk for the importer and for the potential purchaser in the discount market can be lessened even more if the guarantor for the payment is a respected bank; thus a bank accepts the bill (for a fee) from the importer. Bank acceptances are also discussed in Chapter 5.

A number of investment banks were given a big boost hundreds of years ago when governments in Europe were keen to borrow money outside their home territory. The banks organised the borrowing. Still today there are dozens of governments faced with poorly developed domestic capital markets which need to raise funds by selling bonds on the international markets, and they often turn to the investment banks to assist with this – thus they issue emerging market bonds.

Here is a point of confusion: in order to distinguish the central activities of financial advice, raising funds for companies and governments, (including underwriting) from the other activities undertaken by the bank, the former are sometimes collectively referred to as 'investment banking' within investment banks. They are also referred to as corporate finance. (In some banks these terms may also encompass mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructuring.) But as you can see below there are many other activities within investment banks than 'investment banking'. I suppose, at least, it separates some of the core elements focused on helping companies (and governments) from the rest.

## Mergers, acquisitions, corporate restructuring

Investment banks often have large departments ready to advise companies contemplating the merger or takeover of another firm. This sort of help can be very lucrative for the bank – it would seem that for once-in-a-blue-moon corporate actions like this directors do not look too carefully at the amount they have to pay for what is supposedly the best advice available. Indeed, the M&A departments of the banks do attract some very able people, but the fees seem on the high side for handholding and guidance. But then, they do offer, besides expertise on, say, takeover regulation and tactics, a recognised 'name' respected by investors should the acquiring company need to raise additional finance through a bond issue or a rights issue. The fees for a bundle of services like this can run into tens of millions – see Exhibit 3.6. For pure advice (without fund raising) the fees for smaller company deals are around 3–4 per cent of the total sale value; for larger deals (billions) they are generally in the range of 0.125–0.5 per cent. When you consider that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each assist more than 600 billion of M&A each year, even 0.125 per cent fees amount to a large income for advice. And they make a lot more on top by raising finance for the deal makers. Other players in this market usually near the top of the rankings in terms of value of mergers advised on include Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Lazard, UBS, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In some cases fees are payable by the bidder only if the bid is successful or by the target if there is a successful defence

Prudential risks further enraging its shareholders after incurring costs estimated by bankers of more than  $750\mathrm{m}$  (\$511m) on its seemingly doomed  $\$35.5$ bn takeover of AIA.

The British insurer will have to pay AIG a break fee of  $153\mathrm{m}$  if it abandons the deal. Bankers said it could also incur costs of about 500\mathrm{m} in currency hedging and other financing expenses.

A collapsed deal would also deprive 30 banks of one of the biggest fee-generating opportunities in the City over the past decade at a time when their traditional revenue streams from M&A advisory have dried up.

Estimates from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting suggest the M&A advisory fees and underwriting fees on the planned  \$14.5bn rights issue would generate about\$ 850m.

That compares with Vodafone's  \$101bn hostile takeover of Mannesmann in 1999, which produced fees of\$ 283m for the advisers.

More recently, the 16 banks that worked on Royal Bank of Scotland's takeover of ABN Amro took home an estimated 275m in fees.

If Pru's deal succeeds, on the AIA side Citi, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group and Deutsche Bank will split about 53\mathrm{m}. On the Prudential side, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Lazard and Nomura will split about 59\mathrm{m}.

The proposed  \$21.7bn rights offer would generate about\$ 740m in underwriting fees to lead bookrunners HSBC, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Cazenove, to be divided among the 30-bank syndicate.

Banks traditionally pay subunderwriting fees to institutional investors for their help in guaranteeing to take up all new shares issued, ensuring companies receive their money.

Historically, companies paid 2 per cent in underwriting fees, of which banks kept about a quarter.

The Pru was paying banks between 3.5 and 3.75 per cent for underwriting the rights issue, of which 1.75 to 2 per cent would go to the sub-underwriters.

Corporate restructuring comes in many forms, from selling off a subsidiary (a divestiture) to assisting a company that has borrowed too much, found itself in difficulties and needs to 'restructure its debt'. This kind of balance sheet restructuring usually means the lenders accepting a reduction in their claim on the firm (e.g. a £100 million loan is reduced to £70 million or the interest that is in arrears is written off), an extension of the time period to pay, the acceptance of shares in the company in return for writing off debt or the replacement of one bunch of debt agreements with others more suited to the company's reduced circumstances.

Investment banks can assist with valuation and procedural matters for bolt-on acquisitions, e.g. the purchase of a subsidiary from another firm. They might also help with organising an alliance or joint venture of firms or represent the interests of one of the firms in an alliance or joint venture.

Sometimes the chief executive of a corporation announces that they are undertaking 'a strategic review' of the company. This is usually code for 'at the right price we might be in favour of someone buying the company, in the meantime we will try to improve matters'. The review is often assisted/conducted by an investment bank, which is likely to receive telephone calls from prospective buyers. Of course, the bankers will have to work out the value of the firm as a revitalised creature and its value to other companies, and will have to polish up their negotiating skills. A confidential memorandum presenting detailed financial information is likely to be prepared for prospective buyers and the bankers may screen enquiries to narrow them down to serious potential owners only.

The corporate finance bankers within investment banks are generally sophisticated, suave communicators who nurture long-term relationships with key executives in the large corporations. These relationship managers tend to spend their time visiting chief executives and chief financial officers of companies, either those that already work with the investment bank or prospective clients. They are not trying to push one particular product onto clients, but give advice on the most suitable from across the bank's full range for the client at that stage of its development – offering the right solution at the right time. The very best relationship managers (often the corporate broker in the UK) put the needs of the client first at all times. Over a period of years they develop a good understanding of the client's business strategy and financing needs. They are then in a position to draw on the various product specialists within the bank to put together a suitable package of services. They are focused on a very distant horizon, often providing financing advice without a fee for many years in the hope that when the time is right for the corporation to launch an IPO, an SEO or a merger bid, it will pay large fees to the bankers it has trusted for so many years. The following is crude stereotyping, but contains enough truth to be interesting: the traders within the banks (see below for trading activities) tend to have a different personality and culture and there can be a degree of suspicion and mutual misunderstanding between them and the corporate bankers. Traders are focused on making money over short time periods. Corporate bankers sometimes characterise the traders as pushy and uncouth. Meanwhile, the traders often fail to understand the corporate bankers' lack of impatience at making money.

## Risk management

The treasury departments of large companies have to deal with significant amounts of temporary cash and try to earn a return on this cash for a short period. They also need to manage various risk exposures that the firm has, e.g. the problems that can be caused by shifts in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign exchange rates. Investment banks are able to assist with the investment of temporary cash surpluses and discuss with corporate treuers the outlook for risk exposures and advise them on how to mitigate the risk.

## Lending

With a syndicated loan the investment bank may do more than simply advise and arrange the deal – they might participate as a lender. Investment banks may make other loans available to firms. The fact that most investment banks are part of universal banks is used as a competitive weapon – they can use the big bank's enormous balance sheet to offer low-cost loans to help win investment banking business.

## Privatisation

The Thatcher government in the 1980s hit upon the idea of selling off state-owned assets such as Rolls-Royce, British Airways and British Gas. The investment banks assisted in this process, advising and organising the sell-offs, and thus built up a specialised knowledge of privatisation which they were then able to take to other countries as the idea caught on around the globe. The banks have also helped set up public-private partnerships (PPPs) in which governments persuade private firms to build and operate, say, a school or a prison in return for an income flow in subsequent years.

Investment banks are looking forward to helping in the sale of the banks that were rescued by governments around the world and taken into public control - see Exhibit 3.7 for an example.

Thus investment banks benefit from the aftermath of a crisis they helped to create.

#### Exhibit 3.7

##### Advisers set to pitch for share sale of rescued banks

# George Parker and Patrick Jenkins

Investment bankers were yesterday invited to pitch for a share of what is likely to be a goldmine in advising on Britain's biggest ever privatisation: the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.

The government might hope to raise at least  \$100bn from the sale of shares in the two banks, recouping the\$ 70bn the taxpayer spent on rescuing them from collapse and turning a profit.

The sheer size of the privatisation means that UK Financial Investments - which manages the taxpayer shareholding - is expected to feed the shares into the market in tranches over several years.

Yesterday UKFI took the first steps towards assembling a "stable" of investment bank advisers, who might expect to reap fees running to tens of millions of pounds.

UKFI officials say fees will be "highly competitive" given the scale of the enterprise and the stakes involved for the taxpayer.

The privatisation would dwarf those undertaken by Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s, when NM Rothschild earned a reputation as an adviser whose expertise was sought around the world.

Credit Suisse has been one of the closest advisers to the government during the financial crisis. It has played a key role in the design of the government's asset protection scheme, the insurance vehicle that is being put in place to help clean up the toxic assets on the balance sheets of RBS and Lloyds.

Deutsche bank has also been involved in advising on the APS, as have Citigroup and UBS, though UBS's advice mandates with RBS and Lloyds probably preclude it from more government work, on the grounds of conflict of interest.

Much of the advice to the government has been provided for very low fees, in the hope of securing future mandates.

But some bankers believe the UKFI, which stresses its independence from government thinking, could opt instead for an investment bank it has not used before to ensure its advice is not conflicted with that given to the Treasury.

### Market activities

Alongside great skill in assisting companies with primary market issuance of bonds and shares, investment banks have developed experience and superior capability in secondary market dealing for equities, bonds, money market instruments, derivatives, commodities, currencies, etc. They perform one, two or all three of the following roles in market trading:

Broker Act on behalf of clients to try to secure the best buy or sell deal in the marketplace.

Market maker Quote two prices for a security: the price at which they are willing to buy and a (slightly higher) price at which they are willing to sell the same security. They 'make a market' in an instrument and expect to make numerous purchases and sells during a day, taking an income from the gap between the two prices.

- Proprietary trading The bank takes positions in securities in order to try to make a profit for itself rather than for its customers from subsequent favourable movements of prices.

As brokers, investment banks earn commissions on purchases and sales of a wide range of securities. As brokers they do not own the securities but merely act as middlemen, helping buyers and sellers to match up and do a deal. They mainly serve wholesale institutional (e.g. pension funds) and corporate clients rather than individuals, although they may own retail brokerage organisations that serve private investors.

An investment bank may also have a corporate broker arm, which acts on behalf of companies, e.g. providing advice on market conditions, representing the company to the market to generate interest, advising on the rules and regulations applying to stock market-quoted companies. They can also gauge likely demand should a company be interested in selling bonds or shares to investors. Then, during the process of a new issue, they can gauge a suitable price and organise underwriting. They work with the company to maintain a liquid and properly informed market in a client company's shares. They often stand ready to buy and sell the company's shares when market makers and others are refusing to deal. Companies are charged a regular fee by the corporate broker for regular services, but the broker keeps this to a minimum. The idea is to build up a long-term relationship so that the bank might earn a substantial amount should the client need advice and services during a major move such as a rights issue. The corporate broker can also be a bridge linking the client executives to other product providers within the bank. Exhibit 3.8 describes the tensions between clients and corporate brokers as the investment bank tries to cash in on the relationship in times of corporate activity.

# Exhibit 3.8

#### Broking under scrutiny as banks seek fees

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/c3539ebe906f0ca6b99cd3685d0fbcac2b179987d08b87018028fe926468a63b.jpg)

When Citigroup temporarily cut its ties with BHP Billington in the middle of the Anglo-Australian miner's  $39bn ($ 24.5bn) hostile bid for PotashCorp to work for a rival bidder, it sparked a furious debate in the City about the loyalties of corporate brokers to their clients.

As one of the two corporate brokers to BHP, Citigroup had expected to land a financing and advisory role on the company's biggest takeover attempt yet.

When it did not, the US bank switched allegiance and is now advising Sinochem, the Chinese fertiliser company, on a possible counter-bid for Potash. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BHP's other broker, is working with Potash on its defence. BHP's lead adviser on the deal is JPMorgan Cazenove, which is not a broker to the company.

Citigroup's swap highlights the pressure banks are under to turn their UK corporate broking relationships into lucrative advisory and financing mandates, and the tensions that can arise as a result.

As companies begin to emerge from the recession with new strategies and management teams, that pressure is set to intensify with banks looking to seize broking market share to win more of the expected advisory work.

Alisdair Gayne, head of corporate broking at Barclays Capital, said: "Some companies were clearly disappointed with the advice given during last year's cash calls and as a result are likely to review their broking relationships."

Corporate broking, a uniquely British business role that involves a bank acting as the main point of contact between companies and their investors, is a fiercely competitive sector, particularly for FTSE 100 clients. However, it is not generally a profitable line of business and its main value for the banks is as a way into more lucrative advisory roles.

It is also one of the hardest businesses to build. Relationships can be sticky, as several US banks discovered before the financial crisis when they went on expensive poaching sprees to help develop their franchises.

Lehman Brothers, for example, did not have a broking client in the FTSE 100 until 2006 when it replaced ABN Amro Hoare Govett as joint broker to Lloyds.

By the time the bank went bust in 2008, it had only added three other blue-chips to its roster.

"Corporate broking requires long-term investment by banks. It will take time for new entrants to build a client list. Long-term relationships build trust and give the client confidence to use the bank for advice and capital markets execution," said John Woolland, head of corporate broking at UBS.

As global regulators rewrite the industry's rule-book, forcing banks to hold more capital and pare back their riskier activities, corporate broking is seen as an increasingly vital way to boost less capital-intensive businesses, such as mergers and acquisitions advisory work.

BarCap, for example, is on a hiring drive as part of a push

#### Exhibit 3.8 continued into broking as it tries to build up its European equities business. However, it does not expect overnight success.

The three dominant forces in the market, JPMorgan Cazenove, UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, have historically focused on a strategy of critical mass.

The logic is that the more clients they have, the more chances of transactions taking place and the more opportunities to sell other products and boost fees.

Together, those three banks act as either broker or joint broker to 98 FTSE 100 clients.

Some other big institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, have instead chosen to concentrate on large-cap companies, which generate more consistent advisory revenues.

While the bank consistently hovers only in the high single-digits of FTSE 100 clients, for example, it ranks fourth by the overall market capitalisation of its corporate broking customers.

The focus by the bulge bracket on the larger clients has created opportunities for independent brokers, such as Collins Stewart and Evolution Group, to serve smaller companies neglected by the big banks.

Garry Levin, head of corporate finance at Evolution, said: "The economics of the mid-cap independent firms allows them to devote a proportionately greater resource to day-to-day corporate broking services."

As well as calling on their top clients two to three times a week,

Leading corporate brokers

<table><tr><td></td><td>FTSE100</td><td>FTSE 250</td><td>(2010 to date)</td></tr><tr><td>JPMorgan
Cazenove</td><td>37</td><td>100</td><td>2.9bn</td></tr><tr><td>Bank of America
Merrill Lynch</td><td>32</td><td>34</td><td>$2.6bn</td></tr><tr><td>UBS</td><td>29</td><td>39</td><td>$775m</td></tr><tr><td>Morgan Stanley</td><td>19</td><td>0</td><td>\$3.2bn</td></tr><tr><td>Deutsche Bank</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>\$1.8bn</td></tr><tr><td>Citi</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>483m</td></tr><tr><td>RBS Hoare

Mr Levin and his team write to all of their clients every evening updating them on trading in their stock and movements among their peers.

However, smaller operators lack the spread of experience and the muscle to handle, for instance, a large cross-border transaction.

Charles Donald, head of corporate broking at Credit Suisse, said: "Companies want the whole package so brokers with a full equities platform will win market share."

At the height of the financial crisis, banks with a strong balance sheet became the first port of call for many companies and financial institutions looking to raise capital.

For years big banks have also been trying to export the corporate broking model to Europe, with limited success.

Bankers had hoped this would finally change in March, when Citigroup was appointed as corporate broker to Deutsche Telekom, but so far no other European corporates have followed suit.

Market makers, also known as dealers, fulfil a crucial role in the markets: in those securities in which market makers agree to make a market there will always be someone available who will quote a price at which they will buy or sell – as a purchaser or seller you may not like the price but at least someone is making a trade possible. To take share trading as an example, imagine if you wanted to invest in a small company's shares and there were no market makers. You might hesitate because the shares would fail to have the important quality of liquidity, that is the ability to sell the shares quickly at a low transaction cost without moving the price against you. Investors in companies lacking an active secondary market will demand higher rates of return (lower share prices) to compensate for the inability to quickly find a counterparty willing to trade.

We refer to a trading system with market makers at the centre as a quote-driven system because client investing firms can obtain firm bid and offer (ask) prices on a security and the dealers stand ready to trade. A bid price is one that the market maker will buy at (what the client firm could get from selling). An ask or offer price is what the market maker is willing to sell at (what the client firm would have to pay should they want to trade). Naturally, because the market maker is trying to make a profit, the bid price is always lower than the offer price. If the gap becomes too wide, clients will be lured away by better prices offered by competing market makers in that security. The difference between the prices is known as the trader's spread or bid-offer spread. Many of these prices are displayed on electronic systems so that clients can see them displayed on their computer screens throughout the day. Other security bid-offer prices are given to you only if you telephone the market maker and ask for a quote.

Market makers take a considerable risk: they have to hold inventories of shares and other securities to supply those who want to buy. Tying up a lot of money in inventories of shares, bonds, etc. can be very expensive, and there is always the possibility of downward movement in price while they hold millions of pounds or euros in inventory. The degree of risk varies from one security to another and this helps explain the differences in the size of the bid-offer spread. For some securities it is significantly less than 1 per cent of the value, in others it can be 20 per cent or more. The other major factor influencing the spread is the volume of trade that takes place relative to the amount that has to be held in inventory – high volume gives access to a liquid market for the market maker. Thus Marks & Spencer has millions of shares traded every day and so the market maker is not likely to have M&S shares on its hands for long, because they are going out of the door as fast as they are coming in – spreads here can be around one-tenth of 1 per cent. Shares of a small engineering company, meanwhile, might trade in lots of only a few hundred at twoor three-day intervals. Thus the market maker has money tied up for days before selling and is fearful of a price fall between trading days.

We can see how the quote-driven system works through Exhibit 3.9. This could apply to markets in a wide variety of securities and instruments, from bonds to commodities, but we will assume that it is company shares. The demand curve shows that as the price declines, the amount demanded to buy from the market maker rises. The supply curve shows rising volume offered by investors with higher prices. The clearing price is  $199\mathrm{p}$  - this is where the demand from clients wanting to buy and supply of the securities from those wanting to sell is evenly matched. Naturally, the market makers in this security will be taking a spread around this clearing price so the true price to the buying client might be  $199.5\mathrm{p}$ , whereas the price that a seller to the market makers can obtain is only 198.5.

If one of the market makers is currently quoting prices of 200-201p (offering to buy at 200p and sell at 201p) then he will experience a flood of orders from sellers because investors are willing to sell 7,000 shares per hour if offered 200p. However, demand at 201p is a mere 3,000 shares. The market maker will thus end up buying a net 4,000 shares per hour if he takes all the trade. In fact, it is even worse than this for our market maker because the potential buyers can pick up their shares for only 199.5p from other market makers and so he ends up buying 7,000 per hour and not selling any.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/6dd2d60181964e3716d5f8c8f5795efbd4a5853805cd52eec859e8feec466a0a.jpg)

Exhibit 3.9 Supply and demand in a quote-driven market

Even if our market maker is exceptionally optimistic about the market equilibrium price rising significantly above 201p in the next few hours, he is not doing himself any favours by quoting such high prices because he could buy a large number of the shares he wants at a price a lot less than this – there are 5,000 per hour going through other market makers at 199.5p, for example. Thus there is a strong incentive for our market maker to move his prices down towards the intersection of the supply and demand curves.

Now consider a market maker who quotes 198-197.5p. She will experience a flood of buy orders from clients given the prices offered by other market makers in this competitive market. Under the rules governing market makers she is obliged to deal at the prices quoted up to a maximum number of shares (decided by the exchange that controls this particular market). Perhaps this obligation to sell 8,000 shares per hour to clients when she is attracting few (no) clients to sell to her may lead to problems in satisfying demand. She will thus be tempted (unless she has a lot of shares to shift) to move her bid and offer prices to around the market equilibrium price.

A market maker that tries to maintain a large bid-offer spread will fail when there are many market makers for a security. For example, consider the five market makers offering the following prices:

<table><tr><td>Market maker</td><td>Bid price</td><td>Offer price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>198.5p</td><td>199.5p</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>197.3p</td><td>199.5p</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>197.0p</td><td>200.0p</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>198.5p</td><td>199.7p</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>198.3p</td><td>202.0p</td></tr></table>

Any potential seller (or broker for the buyer) would look at the various market makers' prices and conclude that they would like to trade with either market maker 1 or 4 at  $198.5\mathrm{p}$ . Any buyer of shares would want to trade with 1 or 2. Market maker 4 may be temporarily under stocked with these shares and is content to see inventory build up – he is not going to get many to buy from him at  $199.7\mathrm{p}$  when buyers can get away with paying only  $199.5\mathrm{p}$ . Market maker 2, meanwhile, will see more sales than purchases – perhaps she has excessive inventory and wishes to allow an outflow for a while.

Of course, for most companies the intersection of the supply and demand curves moves over time. Perhaps the company announces that it has won a large export order at  $2\mathrm{pm}$ . Immediately the investors see this news on their computer screens and the demand curve shifts upwards while the supply curve shifts downwards. Market makers also read the news and anticipate the shifts and quickly move their price quotes to where they think they can trade with a reasonable balance between bid deals and offer deals, aiming for a large number of each and making a profit on the spread.

Proprietary trading ('prop trading') uses the bank's capital in order to try to make capital gains called 'trading income', which consists of both realised gains, where the trade is completed (there has been both a buy and a sell), and unrealised gains - say a buy has taken place and there is a paper gain but it has not yet been turned into cash by selling, thus all the accountant has to go on is the 'marking to market' of the value at the current price. Proprietary trading grew in volume significantly in the 20 years to 2010, but now governments and regulators around the world are clamping down (see Exhibit 3.10) on what can be risky, high-geared (lots of borrowing or using derivatives) bets; there is a fear that if a number of large bets go wrong in one bank it can lead to a domino-like collapse of other banks as one after the other reneges on its obligations, i.e. systemic risk.

It is not easy to draw a line between prop trading and other activities such as market making – see Exhibit 3.11.

You may think there might be some conflict of interest between advising a firm on its finances or acting as a broker to a pension fund, thus gaining advanced and special knowledge of client actions on the one hand, and to try to make profits by trading the same or similar securities on their own account on the other. You may think that, but I could not possibly comment.

#### Leaving a lasting Wall Street legacy

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/f81d5d40a8ac781cd920b06844bcdfc511deb06987081c8f2cc5dec5498c8198.jpg)

Justin Baer

Paul Volcker will leave a lasting imprint on Wall Street after all.

Derided by banks as politically motivated and ineffective to prevent future crises, the former Federal Reserve chairman's "Volcker rule" - much of it, at least - has survived months of lobbying and legislative horsetrading to remain in the landmark financial regulatory reform measure set to land on President Barack Obama's desk this week.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks will be forced to dismantle or shed proprietary trading desks that powered profits in the past decade - or nearly led to their demise, depending on the institution.

Regulators will also cap the amount of capital banks can invest alongside clients, prompting the gradual unwinding of funds whose performance has also helped fatten returns.

But it could have been worse. Legislators charged with resolving the differences between the two chambers of Congress softened elements of the Volcker rule.

Banks have been freed to hold on to their hedge fund and private equity arms as well as being allowed to invest some of their capital alongside clients.

They were also offered important restrictions on the proprietary trading ban, including trades made to hedge banks' risks or facilitate clients' needs.

And yet the Volcker rule will still challenge Wall Street in ways the public backlash against pay policies or its behaviour during the crisis had failed to. Designed to discourage banks from taking outsized risks and reaping profits at the expense of clients, the reforms will alter the plans of the industry's stalwarts and crimp future results.

None will face more questions than Goldman, whose trading and risk-taking acumen has come to overshadow its vaunted investment banking arm and now dominates the bank's culture.

Goldman has said its prop-trading activities generate about 10 per cent of its revenue, which totalled 45.2bn last year.

A ban on prop trading could sap 20 cents from Goldman's per-share earnings but a broader definition could cost more, according to Keith Horowitz, an analyst at Citigroup.

Goldman earned 22.13 a share last year.

The Volcker rule has also been weakened to allow banks to invest up to 3 per cent of tier one capital into in-house hedge funds and private equity. That too should also strike Goldman harder than its peers.

Goldman held about  \$15.5bn in its own hedge, buy-out and real estate funds as of March, or 23 per cent of its\$ 68.5bn in capital. While the bank will have at least four years to reduce its holdings below 3 per cent, Goldman will need to push billions of dollars into funds or other investments that may not perform as well as its own sponsored vehicles.

Morgan Stanley, whose near-death experience in the financial crisis had already convinced the bank to shift its focus away from prop trading, derives less than 5 per cent of annual revenues from its own accounts. With 23.4bn in revenues last year, it shut down its four credit-trading desks in the wake of a multibillion-dollar loss in 2007 and is considering spinning off its two equity prop arms.

Morgan Stanley had  \$4.6bn in its own sponsored funds at the end of the first quarter, or 9.2 per cent of the\$ 50.1bn it held in tier one capital.

From Wall Street to the City of London, "prop" traders - who deal for their bank's own (proprietary) account - are renowned as the widest of wide boys. They are the archetypal buyers of Rolex watches and red Ferraris, the incarnation of the fat-walleted banker.

Politically, then, they were a logical enough target for Barack Obama's broadside against banks, designed to "protect taxpayers" and "rein in excesses". The same motivation lay behind the UK's 50 percent supertax on bank bonuses.

For Mr Obama, though, there was an intellectually compelling justification too. By stopping banks from owning hedge funds, private equity and prop trading operations - the kind of "casino banking" that involves betting bank capital to generate quick profits - he is trying to cut risk in the financial sector.

# Exhibit 3.11 continued

The first two of the three taboos (if Congress backs the president's plan), will be straightforward to implement. But cracking down on prop trading will be far from easy.

Defining it is the core problem. While most banks, in the boom years up to 2007, had vast prop trading teams that would take big bets on anything from the future price of wheat to exchange rates in west Africa, most "dedicated prop" teams were wound down amid the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs, which says it still generates more than 10 per cent of revenues from prop trading, is a big exception.

But the absence of dedicated desks does not mean prop trading no longer exists, however much many banks would like to claim as much. Virtually any trading operation uses so-called "flow prop", whereby a bank piggybanks on the trades it is processing for clients, doing a bit here, a bit there, often hedging a client investment with an opposing risk on the bank's own account.

Such activity, much of it vital to be an effective market-maker for clients, is reckoned to be low-risk - except if a trader gets carried away. Société Générale racked up a loss of nearly €5bn when Jérôme Kerviel did so a couple of years ago.

Bankers and lawyers agree that it will be nightmarish for regulators to separate what is genuinely necessary trading from what is egregious prop. And with many pundits betting that at least some of Europe, notably the UK under any future Conservative administration, will adopt the US blueprint, this is not just an issue for US prop desks. But whether it is through legislative bans or high capital requirements imposed by regulators, prop trading is likely to become much less common within banks.

Banks insist such moves will not eliminate the risk to the system, though, just shift it elsewhere - probably to unregulated hedge funds and low-tax, light-regulation centres such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

Safeguarding banks and their depositors - virtually all of them taxpayers and voters - is a crowdpleasing move. But in a globalised business, with every kind of financial institution inextricably interlinked, sceptics fear it will do little to make the system safer.

Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United's manager, is not slow to react when a player incurs his wrath. It seems that the club's owners take the same approach with investment banks.

The Glazer family are considering severing ties with Goldman Sachs after Jim O'Neill, the bank's chief economist, was revealed as a member of a consortium looking to buy the football club.

Goldman insists that Mr O'Neill is working in a personal capacity, but his role brings back uncomfortable memories of a clash United had with JPMorgan four years ago when Malcolm Glazer first bid for the club.

At the time, JPMorgan Cazenove was acting as United's stockbroker while its parent company, JPMorgan, had been arranging  $265\mathrm{m}$  of debt for Mr Glazer's bid.

The dual role infuriated Sir Roy Gardner, then chairman of United, who claimed it represented a clear conflict of interest and was hostile in nature.

The row also had wider repercussions. Two months later, Centrica dropped JPMorgan Cazenove as its joint broker. Sir Roy happened to be chief exec utive of the UK energy supplier at the time.

In the same year, Roger Carr, who was chairman of Centrica, had his own clash with Goldman Sachs.

Mr Carr was also chairman of Mitchells & Butlers when Goldman made an indicative  $\S 4.6\mathrm{bn}$  debt-and-equity offer for the pub group, on behalf of a consortium in which it was one of the largest participants.

Mr Carr described the offer as "hostile and inappropriate", the bank withdrew from the consortium, and the bid evaporated. Mr Carr's anger struck a chord with Goldman - the bank acted as

# Exhibit 3.12 continued corporate broker to both Centrica and Cadbury, where Mr Carr was also a board member.

Goldman's private equity fund had also been involved in unsolicited approaches to ITV and BAA. Those episodes prompted Hank Paulson, Goldman's then chairman and chief executive, to warn its bankers not to use its principal investment funds in hostile situations.

The potential for conflicts of interest for banks has intensified in recent years in tandem with the rapid development of new financial products. Full-service banks incorporating private equity funds, advisers, traders and asset managers under one roof are likely to run more risks than single-discipline boutiques.

Banks have so-called Chinese Walls, which are supposed to limit the flow of information between different businesses, such as proprietary trading and investment banking.

In reality, these walls are only as sound as the integrity of the banks that erect them.

Megan Murphy and Francesco Guerrera

These "prop" desks are now having to live in a new post-crisis world of tougher regulation. Many star traders across Wall Street and the City of London are voting with their feet, decamping for hedge funds in their droves amid a crackdown that will sharply curtail banks' riskier activities. And financial groups are grappling with ways to salvage some of their proprietary operations.

In some cases, such as the recent exit of Pablo Calderini, Deutsche's former head of equity proprietary trading, departures come as institutions look to close "pure" prop desks, which trade exclusively for their own account, rather than clients. Deutsche's investment bank, for example, cut sharply the amount of capital available for equity proprietary trading by 90 per cent in the aftermath of the crisis and closed down its credit proprietary trading desk altogether.

US banks claim not to be in a rush to decide the fate of their own prop desks, noting the new rules give them at least two years to scrap those activities.

However, many are already scrambling behind the scenes to redeploy their best traders, precisely because they don't want them to succumb to the lure of hedge funds and other institutions that will escape the new legislation. Although the importance of prop trading varies between banks, ranging from the 10 per cent or so of Goldman's revenues to less than 2 per cent at Citigroup, all are faced with the same three alternatives.

The first is to shut down prop activities and let traders go. Wall Street executives say banks are unlikely to pursue that option, mainly because they do not want to lose good traders who could be useful elsewhere in the organisation.

However, some admit that they might be forced to take this route if the onset of the legislation prompts a large part of their prop trading workforce to flee for less regulated companies.

The second is to move prop traders to their main "flow" desks dealing with clients' orders. Although superficially attractive, this solution has the potential pitfall that traders who have so far thrived on the "prop" model - being given money by the bank to invest as they please - might not relish, or be any good at, carrying out orders on behalf of customers.

To obviate this problem, banks could opt to move the prop trading desk into their in-house asset management operations and require them to raise third party funds. This alternative has the advantage of placing traders in a set-up that closely resembles the pre-legislation prop desks while enabling the bank to earn fees on their work. In order to succeed, though, this strategy needs prop traders with good track records to persuade investors to park funds.

There is also a fourth more radical, alternative: the complete spin-off or sale of prop trading desks, a move that would lead to a cash windfall for banks but would force them to part company with talented and cash-generating traders.

With such highly-profitable employees leaving almost daily, banks may need to make their minds up sooner rather than later.

# Fixed income, currencies and commodities trading (FICC)

The FICC operations of an investment bank concentrate on sales and trading (e.g. market making) of highly liquid debt securities, swaps (see Chapter 11), currencies and commodities on behalf of client firms, rather than on their own account. The top 14 banks generate a combined revenue (income) of around 150 billion from FICC, which accounted for more than half of all revenues in 2009 and early 2010 (admittedly this was a particularly good period for FICC as bid-offer spreads remained high in historical terms following the crisis). The big players in this market are Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Barclays (following its acquisition of Lehman's New York operations).

The fixed-income section of a bank specialises in deals in interest-rate securities. This includes the following:

- High-grade (low-risk) corporate bonds: domestic bonds (under the laws and regulations of the country where they are issued where the issuer is a local firm), foreign bonds (the issuer comes from abroad but the bond is under the jurisdiction of the country of issue) and international bonds (or Eurobonds), where the bond is issued outside the jurisdiction of the country in whose currency it is denominated. See Chapter 6 for a description of bonds.
- Sovereign bonds - issued by governments (see Chapter 6).
- Credit derivatives such as credit default swaps, which allow investors to buy a kind of insurance against the possibility of a bond failing to pay the agreed interest and/or principal amounts (more in Chapter 11).
High-yield securities such as high-yield bonds (see Chapter 6).
- Bank loans - yes, there is a secondary market in bank loans.
- Local authority/municipal debt.
- Emerging market debt – bonds, etc. issued by governments or corporations in developing markets (some might be economically developed but under-developed with regard to financial markets).
Distressed debt - borrowers are not meeting their obligations under a debt agreement.
- Mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities - see securitisation later in the chapter.
- Interest rate derivatives such as interest rate futures – see Chapter 10.
Money market instruments - see Chapter 5.

There are other divisions that deal in currencies and currency derivatives (see Chapter 12). There is usually yet another division that specialises in commodities and commodity derivatives (see Chapter 13).

In all these FICC areas the bank often acts as a market maker in these products, creator of many of them, as an adviser and broker for clients and as a proprietary trader. How they manage the conflicts of interest inherent in this I cannot tell you – but I can tell you that there are scandals from time to time.

# Equities

The equities section of an investment bank helps clients with their investing and trading strategies in shares and equity-linked investments. The more exotic instruments they deal in include:

- futures in shares and futures in market indices (e.g. FTSE 100 index) - see Chapter 10;
- equity options giving the right but not the obligation to buy or sell shares at a pre-agreed price some time in the future - see Chapter 11;
- warrants on shares (similar to options but issued by the company rather than financial institutions) – see Chapter 9;
- preference shares - see Chapter 8.

Again, the bank will often act as market maker in these products, creator of many of them, as a broker for clients and as a proprietary trader.

# Derivatives

Investment banks not only act as market makers or brokers in the derivative markets but also create new derivatives (originating) and market them to clients. Much of the commodity market trading by investment banks is via derivatives such as futures, whereby the buyer enters into a contract to buy or to sell the underlying commodity at a fixed price at a point in the future, say three months hence. They may assist firms trying to hedge in these markets, e.g. an airline trying to fix the future price of its aviation fuel, or they may conduct proprietary trades to make a profit for the bank. Of course, investment banks will also assist with non-derivative commodity trading by helping a client buy for immediate use some quantity of a commodity - spot trading.

It has been known for investment bankers to get too enamoured of the fancy derivative strategies they devised for companies and governments. They can be very complex and it can be almost impossible for the client to understand the full implications of the risks they are exposed to. Whether the lack of understanding is to be blamed on the clients or on the lack of effort on the part of the bankers to explain themselves is a moot point. Many Italian local authorities are fuming at the bankers for getting them into a mess with interest rate derivatives. Now Goldman Sachs is heavily criticised in China for selling oil derivatives to state companies – see Exhibit 3.14.

By Jamil Anderlini in Beijing

Public criticism of Goldman Sachs has come to China, where the bank has been attacked in the state-controlled media.

Apparently emboldened by congressional inquiries and anger in the west, the media have slated Goldman, arguably the most successful foreign investment bank in China.

Many people believe Goldman, which goes around the Chinese market slurping gold and sucking silver, may have, using all kinds of deals, created even bigger losses for Chinese companies and investors than it did with its fraudulent actions in the US," the China Youth Daily said last week.

The report followed similar commentary and articles in 21st Century Business Herald and New Century Weekly.

The reports were critical of Goldman for designing and selling oil hedging contracts to state Chinese groups that then lost out when oil prices plunged, contrary to Goldman analysts' predictions, in 2008 and 2009.

Probably the most telling assertion is the complaint that Goldman has been too successful in China, that it has made too much money from underwriting initial public offerings, arranging deals and making its own private equity investments.

Goldman saw a 2007 investment in a pharmaceuticals export company of less than  $5\mathrm{m}$  rise to nearly  $\$1$ bn at the company's IPO.

# Securitisation (and other structured products)

During the 15 years to the end of 2008 banks (particularly US banks) built an enormous business in rebundling debt. So, say a bank has recently enticed 1,000 households to borrow money from it for house mortgages. It now has the right under the law to receive monthly interest and principal from the households. The traditional thing to do is to hold on to those bank assets until the mortgagees pay off the loan. Banks increasingly thought it better to do something else: 'originate and distribute' debt. Thus once they have the right to the interest, etc., the 1,000 rights on the mortgages are put into a special purpose vehicle (SPV) (a separate company), which issues bonds to other investors. The cash raised from selling the bonds goes to the bank so that it can originate another 1,000 mortgages. The investors in the SPV receive regular interest on the long-term bonds that they bought, which is paid for out of the receipts of monthly mortgage payments by 1,000 households.

In theory, the bank makes a nice profit because it gets more for selling the rights than it lent out in the first place. As banks became greedier and keener to originate mortgages and play this game they found they did not have enough of their own money to lend in high volume. They thus turned to the wholesale money markets to raise money. Many of these wholesale loans were only short term – they had to be repaid within days, weeks or months. This was OK if the banks could quickly securitise the newly originated mortgages. But what if everyone suddenly stopped buying securitised bonds? What if you as a bank had borrowed money for 30 days and then lent it out to mortgage holders for 25 years on the expectation of completing the securitisation (or simply expected to take out another 30-day loan when the first expired to tide you through to a securitisation the next month) and then everyone stopped buying securitised bonds or lending to banks wanting to do securitisations because of fears over the banks' solvency? Answer: financial system disaster.

As well as playing a major part in originating their own mortgage loans to people followed by securitisation, investment banks assisted other organisations to carry out securitisation, and they traded in the securitised financial instruments and their derivatives. A major driving motive for the rise in securitisation was to get around the prudential regulations for banks to hold high reserves. The more loans a bank has granted in addition to others that are still residing on the balance sheet, the more it has to hold in capital reserves. As we saw earlier, high capital reserves can lower the return on equity capital. Thus, to raise returns banks took the mortgages off their balance sheets by selling them.

Banks securitise more than simply mortgages, e.g. car loans, credit card debt, student loans and rights to royalties from David Bowie's music. Following the financial crisis of 2008-2010 the securitised market became very small and is no longer a major profit centre for banks. There is more on securitisation in Chapter 6.

The structured finance departments of investment banks have gone beyond simple securitisation. They have developed some weird – and not so wonderful – instruments such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs): these are discussed further when we consider the financial crisis in Chapter 16.

# Asset management

Many investment banks have fund management arms that manage assets on behalf of pension funds, charities or companies. They try to generate high returns relative to risk by selecting investments for the funds. These investments vary widely, from shares and bonds to property and hedge funds.

They also manage the savings of private individuals through the unit trusts, OEICS, mutual funds and investment trusts that they set up and market. As managers they will receive a fee and, possibly, a bonus for exceptional performance. These collective investment vehicles are discussed in the next chapter.

# Investment advice

Many investment banks have teams of investment analysts examining the accounts and other data relating to companies quoted on stock markets, so that they can make recommendations on whether or not their shares, bonds or other securities are good value for potential investors. Alongside the analysts there might be private-client representatives talking to individual investors and an institutional sales force assisting professional managed funds to find good investments and manage risk. As well as analysing companies they will provide analysis of industries, markets, macroeconomics and currencies worldwide.

Unfortunately, such research may be tainted because analysts within an investment bank are sometimes in contact with the section of the bank that advises the same companies on financing strategy. The corporate finance section may be keen on encouraging the analysts to provide positive research about an issuer of shares or bonds (or a company that they are advising in a merger deal) – if they succumb to this pressure their independence is compromised.

A further pressure comes from the fact that company managers do not like to read that their shares are regarded by an investment bank analyst as being over-valued. If they read such a report then they may retaliate by refusing to speak to analysts from that bank and this can mean that in-depth reports on that company cannot be compiled. Thus we have another incentive for analysts to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative in their reports. In the US, where this prob lem seems to be most acute, it can be that there are nine positive reports on companies for every negative one. Despite the availability of many unbiased bankers' analyses, the trend is increasingly for the investing institutions (the buy-side) to employ their own analysts rather than rely on the sell-side analysts who might be assisting the sale of securities.

# Wealth management and private banking

Wealth management and private banking (terms that are used interchangeably) are undertaken by a number of banks, some of which are investment banks. It involves services and advice to improve the management of the financial affairs of high-net-worth individuals, including their investments, current deposit accounts (possibly in numerous currencies and jurisdictions), obtaining of loans and tax issues. The definition of a high-net-worth individual varies, but usually means they have more than 1 million in net wealth besides the main home. There are some old and venerable names in this business, such as C. Hoare and Co., and Pictet & Cie, but most of the universal banks also have private banking arms for their wealthier customers.

# Prime brokerage for hedge funds

Some investment banks have prime brokerage arms that provide services for hedge funds (discussed in Chapter 14), such as acting as a broker buying and selling blocks of shares, derivatives, etc. (trade execution) for the fund, clearing and settlement of trades, risk management, back-office accounting services, cash management and custodial services. The main source of income for the bank from prime brokerage usually comes in the form of interest charged for lending to the hedge fund, fees for arranging debt supplied by others and income from stock (share) lending to enable the hedge fund to sell securities short (i.e. sell without first buying – the buying comes later, hopefully at a lower price than they were sold for). Another role for prime brokers is in helping their hedge fund clients find investors – called a cap-intro (capital introduction) service. Investment banks are often in contact with wealthy family investment offices, private banking offices and institutional investors (end-investors) and so can point them in the direction of those hedge funds for which they are prime brokers. A few investment banks also supply fast electronic trading systems to hedge funds so that they can tap into the markets directly and create automated buy and sell strategies.

# Private equity (venture capital) investment

This is finance for new and growing companies that have not gained a quotation on a stock exchange. It can consist of a mixture of debt and equity, and can be an investment for the bank itself or on behalf of clients of the bank. There is more on private equity in Chapter 14.

# International banking

International banking means banking business conducted across national borders and/or with foreign currencies. This can be retail or wholesale banking, personal or corporate banking, as well as investment banking. Fifteenth-century Florentine bankers set up subsidiaries in other European countries to help their clients with trade finance and to lend large volumes. The clients were sometimes Italian, but there were many non-Italians who recognised the need to obtain finance and other banking services beyond the confines of their own nation. Nineteenth-century colonialism and globalisation led to a rapid expansion in banking as British, Dutch and Belgian banks established branches in places as far flung as Australia and India, while building a strong presence in the Americas. Towards the end of the nineteenth century banks from many other countries, e.g. Canada and Japan, also developed international activities. The Americans were relatively slow in getting started because they were restrained by law from establishing branches abroad. The rules were relaxed, but the US banks did not respond in any significant way until after the Second World War. Even as late as 1960 only eight US banks had overseas branches. But once they got going they grew rapidly so that now more than 50 US banks have branches abroad and some of these institutions have grown to become the dominant banks in many of the financial centres around the globe.

We need to be clear what we are talking about when we use the term international banking. There are many different levels, different types of services. Exhibit 3.15 is my attempt at bringing some clarity to this area. Eurocurrency banking is very big business – billions every day. This is money deliberately held outside the control of the regulators and governments of the currency. Thus, for example, there is a vast quantity of US dollars held in Eurocurrency accounts in London and other places outside the US which is lent out at Eurocurrency interest rates. There are Euroyen (outside the control of the Japanese), EuroSwiss Francs, etc. This market in international money beyond government control was established long before the creation of the new European currency, the euro. It is important to note that the Eurocurrencies are not confined to European countries; much of the trading takes place in Singapore, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. There is much more on Eurocurrencies in Chapter 5.

As large companies established themselves in a number of countries they expected that their home-country bank would expand with them and provide services when they operated abroad. So, a French company operating in the US may need banking services from the US-based branch of its French bank. It might need a loan in dollars to build a factory in Chicago, for instance. Or, when goods are sold in dollars, it needs its bank to exchange them for euros. Of course, the French manufacturer could use a US bank, but companies often prefer to work with their home bank with which they have a long-term relationship, with mutual understanding of customs, culture and practices.

London is the largest cross-border lending financial centre, with an almost 20 per cent share of worldwide activity. It established this position in the days of the British Empire. As well as being at the centre of the English-speaking trading network it pulled in European bankers. The main attraction for the foreign banks coming to London before 1914 was that it allowed them to participate in the London money markets. Here they could invest surplus cash holdings in interest-bearing instruments that were highly liquid. They could not do this on the same scale in their home financial centres. In the 1960s and 1970s there was rapid growth of foreign banks in London due to the take-off of the Euromarkets. US bankers tended to lead here. By the mid-1980s there were more than 400 foreign banks in London. Since then there have been amalgamations and departures of smaller banks so at the time of writing that figure stands at around 250. Having a major presence in London seems to be seen as a requirement to be taken seriously as a player in the banking world. It is at the centre of the world time zones, has great depth and breadth of banking skills and support services (lawyers, accountants, etc.) and is the main Eurocurrency, international bond and foreign exchange trading location.

There are a number of ways in which overseas banking can be organised. A very simple method that does not require the establishment of an office overseas is to employ the services of a correspondent bank. Here, a well-established bank in the country is asked to undertake tasks for clients of the foreign bank, such as payment transactions, current accounts, custody services and investing funds in financial markets. They may also introduce banking clients to local businesspeople. Correspondent banks are paid a fee by the foreign bank.

An operation that requires slightly more commitment to a foreign banking environment is opening a representative office. These are often small, rudimentary affairs that assist the parent bank's customers in that country. They might provide information on the country to clients and help them form banking and business relationships in the country. However, they cannot provide core overseas banking business to clients, i.e. no deposits or loans in the overseas country, through the office. Representative offices are also used to entice potential foreign customers, acting as marketing offices for the parent.

An agency office is a greater commitment than a representative office. It is usually prohibited from accepting deposits from host-country residents, but can be used to transfer other funds and make loans. It is not subject to the same full regulatory requirement as the host-country banks, such as having insurance for deposits (so depositors can get money back from a government-regulated body if the bank goes bust – see Chapter 15).

A branch of the parent bank bears its name and legally acts as part of the overall bank. Creditors to the branch have a claim on the organisation as a whole, including the parent's assets. They often provide as full a range of banking services as the banking regulators in the host

# Exhibit 3.15 Different types of international banking country allow. Branches are a very common way for banks to expand, but following the 2008 financial crisis with the problems caused by branches not maintaining capital reserves in the host country (e.g. money could be taken back to the parent and if the parent then fails, the depositors (or depositor insurer) may not recover their money), regulators are pushing for less branch banking and more subsidiary banking.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/8d5594ceb2b3e8dcfb083395c4ccdb4876e2cc594225dbf7e4be8708dda4e2f7.jpg)

A subsidiary, set up as a separate legal entity in the host country, will be subject to the same regulations as the host country banks. It has its own capital reserves kept within the country and has to follow the same regulatory procedures as the host-country banks. If it runs into trouble, the host-country authorities will expect the parent to pump in more capital, but given the separate company status, the parent may not be obliged to do this and so a subsidiary structure may be safer for the parent. Subsidiaries may be grown from scratch or be formed as a result of an acquisition of a bank(s), as in the case of Santander in the UK, which bought Abbey National in 2004.

# The mutuals

There are thousands of financial institutions that perform many bank-type functions but which are member-owned rather than owned by shareholders. These are mutually owned, the members usually being depositors (or depositors plus borrowers together). Profits are either distributed to members or they are ploughed back into the business. They are called by a number of names, including mutuals, thrifts, building societies, cooperative banks, savings and loans, savings banks, people's banks, community banks and credit unions. Even with different labels they generally do much the same type of banking, but there are subtle differences in constitution, target members, borrowing purpose and legal structure from one country to another.

The big advantage they have compared with the corporate banks is that they do not have to pay returns to shareholders which, at least in theory, allows them to offer better rates to savers and borrowers. They also tend to develop a culture of cautious risk taking because they do not have to maximise profits by buying into the latest financial whizz-bang instruments or stretch their capital bases to conduct high levels of lending, thus they are better positioned to survive a financial crisis. However, while most prize conservative banking practices, some have been tempted to take higher risks through overseas expansions, venturing into investment banking and plunging into exotic instruments pools, such as US sub-prime mortgage-based instruments.

A general drawback with many mutuals is that they are vulnerable to going through a poor patch (e.g. a few borrowers failing to repay) because they do not have shareholders to turn to for fresh capital in a crisis, which can result in insolvency. They have to rely on an accumulation of profits and attracting new deposits to rebuild capital, and this can be too slow. Take the years 2008-2010, when European shareholder-owned banks raised more than €100 billion to buttress their capital by selling new shares. The mutuals, meanwhile, had limited options. Their main response was to increase the interest rate on deposits, which resulted in a profits squeeze because they could not raise lending rates to the same extent. This happened at the same time that the regulators were ratcheting up the amount of capital reserves they had to hold. As a result many of them were forced into selling themselves or combining with other mutuals or accepting venture capital money.

There are 4,500 mutuals in Europe alone and with 50 million members the mutually owned financial institutions account for a very substantial share of all the customer deposits in many countries. In France, for example, over 40 per cent of depositors' money goes to cooperatives and the like. In Finland, Austria and the Netherlands the figure is around one-third, and in Germany and the UK it is over 15 per cent. Almost one in five Europeans is a member of a mutual. In Germany alone there are 30 million customers holding more than €1,000 billion.

# Origins of the mutuals

People are often vulnerable to the predator-like behaviour of local moneylenders. Early in the nineteenth century, philanthropic Scots, English and Americans recognised the need for institutions that allowed the poor to save in a secure place and to borrow at reasonable interest rates as the need arose. These institutions were designed to avoid dominance by rapacious owners by making them mutually owned. Many Germans set up similar organisations later in the century, to be followed by dozens of others in countries around the world. Mutuals were principally seen as a good way for thrifty, hard-working families to save up to buy a home or to build their business.

We do not have the space to look at the mutuals in every country, so we will examine merely some of the leading economies.

# Germany

In Germany, each county or federal state seems to have its own Sparkasse or Landesbank (there are more than 430 Sparkassen and a handful of Landesbanken). In the strictest sense these are often not mutuals because local governments own and control them, but they are established to help the people of a region rather than being run for shareholder benefit. The Sparkasse were founded by local and regional governments to raise finance for infrastructure projects and to make loans to the poor, attracting deposits from households and firms. They opened up the possibility for ordinary people to create long-term, secure and interest-bearing reserves to cope with the adversities of life (illness, age, etc.). They lend over one-fifth of all loans to German households and domestic companies.

Sparkassen are much smaller than the Landesbanken, which were originally established to act as 'central banks' to the savings banks, providing payment clearing and other services and helping them survive rough patches. They carry out some of the international, financial market-orientated banking activities on behalf of the savings banks which are too small to do this.

The Landesbanken are controlled by regional governments (with savings banks having a stake), but depend on funding from markets rather than customer deposits. However, commercial sense often takes second place behind regional politicians' priorities in terms of local jobs, power and prestige. As a result, German bank profitability is one of the lowest in Europe, dragged down by the frequent losses of the Landesbanken. The Landesbanken offer a full range of banking services, including international banking – they are universal banks. They are now much larger than most shareholder-owned banks, e.g. WestLB has more than €250 billion in assets and BayernLB has over €340 billion. All told, they make up about one-sixth of German banking assets and issue about a quarter of corporate loans.

Until 2005 the Landesbanken benefited from state guarantees (creditors to the bank were reassured they would be repaid), which allowed them to borrow cheaply. This they did in abundance and then used the money raised to buy a lot of duff assets, such as US sub-prime mortgage-backed bonds and foreign property. They were prone to over-ambition, poor governance and excessive risk taking. Their adventurousness was to lead to the undoing of many of them in 2009. BayernLB and WestLB, for example, lost billions of euros and had to be bailed out by the government. They still receive state aid. Many commentators see them as market-distorting competitors to the conventional banks due to their special privileges, as well as being unstable. Further, they call for their winding down or privatisation. The EU Commission is furious at the way these inefficient giants are revived time and again by German politicians, thus putting pressure on the rivals not favoured by the government. Thus, Germany has only one world-class bank: Deutsche Bank.

There are also more than 1,100 German credit cooperative banks which are owned by members of a profession or trade. The German coops account for about 13 per cent of lending to households and German companies and 18 per cent of mortgage lending. Bausparkassen accept deposits and provide finance for people wanting to buy a house. They also provide finance to build houses.

# Spain

In Spain, there are 17 cajas (more properly, cajas de ahora, often with Caixa in their titles), which account for 40 per cent of the retail assets held by the banking system and more than half of mortgage lending. These local savings banks have their roots in the Catholic church's attempts at providing microfinance (very small deposits and loans) for the poor. But they were described as quasi-mutual because despite some control being in the hands of depositors and employees, they were heavily influenced by regional politicians and their cronies.

During the decade up to 2007 the cajas raised vast amounts of money from the bond markets (mostly by using their rights to receive money from mortgages as collateral – securitised bonds) and then lent heavily to property developers, other business organisations and politically motivated public works projects. The crash in the Spanish property market has been particularly painful, creating an enormous quantity of bad loans. The global financial crisis then exacerbated the problem. Before the crisis there were 45 cajas, but the weakest were forced to seek protection by merging with stronger ones as the government insisted that they reduce their cost bases, particularly by closing surplus branches. Other post-crisis innovations are the right to sell equity to investors (up to half the caja's equity) and the restricting of the number of elected politicians and public officials on their management and supervisory boards, with the intention of professionalising the management.

# The US

In the US, three types of organisation are collectively referred to as 'thriffs': savings and loan associations (S&Ls), savings banks and credit unions. Savings and loan associations (savings associations) are primarily focused on lending for real estate and house purchase by families. They have been around for over 180 years and they grew rapidly until the crisis of the early 1980s caused by imprudent lending and the restriction of being tied to lending fixed rate while borrowing floating rate (on deposits) at a time of rising inflation and interest rates. Today 80 per cent or more of the finance they raise comes from savings accounts (most of the rest from the wholesale financial markets), while over 90 per cent of their assets are secured by real estate. There are more than 1,000 S&Ls with over 1.5 trillion of assets.

US savings banks were established by philanthropists in the nineteenth century to encourage the poor to save. While they do lend for house purchase they are not as heavily concentrated on mortgages as the S&Ls. They are permitted to invest in a greater range of assets, so they hold large amounts of government bonds, money market instruments and corporate bonds. There are more than 300 savings banks, mainly concentrated in the northeast of the US (S&Ls are located throughout the country).

Credit unions (CUs) were established on both sides of the Atlantic in the early nineteenth century to help poor people by providing a safe place for their money and allowing them to borrow at reasonable interest rates. They are set up when people have some other association, e.g. church membership or workplace – a 'common bond membership'. The CU member regularly saves money into an account and can then borrow a multiple of the amount as small, fixed-term personal loans (rather than long-term mortgages). CUs are granted tax privileges to encourage the poor to save. Also, employers often help with office space and items such as free electricity. They offer checking (cheque) accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, certificates of deposit and online banking.

Typical loans sizes are 10,000 - 15,000, with more than one-third going for car purchase and one-third for house purchase. Most CUs have remained local, but a few are national or international, e.g. Navy Federal Credit Union (41 billion in assets and 3.4 million members). Multinational corporations often encourage workplace CUs (e.g. Boeing employees). The US has about 8,000 CUs with around 87 million members, accounting for some 10 per cent of consumer deposits and 15 per cent of consumer loans.

# United Kingdom

Building societies go back as far as the eighteenth century. They had a very simple function within a town or small region: households (members) saved into them and when they had saved enough they could borrow to purchase a house (if there was a good prospect of them being able to repay). They are not profit maximisers but try to balance the interests of borrowers seeking low interest rates and savers wanting high interest rates.

They dominated the mortgage market until the 1980s, but deregulation led to many new entrants, especially banks. In the last two decades of the twentieth century there was much deregulation so that building societies could offer cheque accounts, unsecured loans, ATMs and lend against commercial assets. In addition, an increasing proportion of their funding has come from the wholesale markets rather than retail members, although this rarely exceeds one-third of liabilities. In 1900 there were over 1,700, but this number has dwindled as a result of building societies combining into larger groups and many larger groups converting themselves into limited companies with shareholders (demutualisation) and floating on the London Stock Exchange. Others were bought by banking groups. The reasons for converting to companies include the ability to tap shareholders for funds to support the growth or survival of the business, to allow expansion into new areas such as life insurance and corporate lending, pressure from members to receive a windfall by selling their shares, and empire building by directors.

Of the remaining 49 at the time of writing, Nationwide is the largest with £191 billion of assets. These organisations still account for about one-sixth of UK mortgage lending.

The old building societies now converted to banks generally continued to focus on house lending and so we refer to them as mortgage banks. Most of these were bought by universal banks once they floated on the stock market. Thus, Halifax is part of Lloyds (previously part of Halifax Bank of Scotland which was bought by Lloyds in the 2008 crisis), as is Cheltenham and Gloucester. Abbey and Alliance and Leicester are part of Santander.

The UK also has more than 400 credit unions with over 750,000 members with a common bond.3 They have a history going back to the industrial revolution. Some of the larger ones offer current accounts, debit cards and cash withdrawals from ATMs. Life insurance is often included in membership. The affiliations range from taxi drivers to the Toxteth community. According to the Association of British Credit Unions, over £400 million is saved in UK CUs, and a similar volume of loans.

There is only one UK cooperative bank with 2 per cent of UK bank deposits and 300 branches (including Britannia (a building society) which merged with the Coop in 2009). It offers current accounts, savings accounts, credit cards and loans. Co-operative Insurance offers a variety of insurance products and Co-operative Investments offers products including unit trusts, investment bonds and pensions.

# France, the Netherlands and Asia

In France, the savings banks, Caisses d'Epargne, have powers to enter into a wide range of banking activities for retail depositors but not to lend commercial loans. France's biggest retail bank, Crédit Agricole, is a cooperative. It is majority owned by 39 French cooperative retail banks, Caisses Régionales de Crédit Agricole Mutuel. Other mutual/cooperative French banks with large shares of the deposit market are Crédit Mutuel and Banque Populaire.

In the Netherlands, over 40 per cent of all banking deposits are in cooperatives. Rabobank Nederland is an organisation that acts for 143 independent agricultural cooperatives, called Rabobanks. Collectively they form the second biggest banking institution in Holland.

There are tens of thousands of cooperatives in India and in China. Also, Japan has a thriving coop sector.

# Finance houses

A finance house is an institution which advances credit, usually through factoring, via a hire purchase agreement or a lease. Strictly, these organisations are classified as 'non-bank institutions' but they provide debt finance and they are often owned by the major banks and so are included in this chapter. Typically, they do not take deposits but obtain their funds from the money and bond markets. Some of the largest finance houses are owned by commercial organisations such as General Motors, Ford or General Electric rather than banks.

# Factoring

Factoring (or 'invoice finance') companies provide three services to firms with outstanding debtors (also called trade receivables – amounts not yet paid by customers), the most important of which is the immediate transfer of cash. This is provided by the factor on the understanding that when invoices are paid by customers the proceeds will go to them. Factoring is increasingly used by companies of all sizes as a way of meeting cash flow needs induced by rising sales and debtor balances. In the UK, about 80 per cent of factoring turnover is handled by the clearing bank subsidiaries, e.g. HSBC Invoice Finance, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland Corporate Banking. However, there are dozens of smaller factoring companies.

# 1 The provision of finance

At any one time a typical business can have one-fifth or more of its annual turnover outstanding in trade debts: a firm with an annual turnover of £5 million may have a debtor balance of £1 million. These large sums create cash difficulties which can pressurise an otherwise healthy business. Factors step in to provide the cash needed to support stock levels, pay suppliers and generally aid more profitable trading and growth. The factor will provide an advanced payment on the security of outstanding invoices. Normally about 80 per cent of the invoice value can be made available to a firm immediately (with some factors this can be as much as 90 per cent). The remaining 20 per cent is transferred from the factor when the customer finally pays up. Naturally the factor will charge a fee and interest on the money advanced. The cost will vary between clients depending on sales volume, the type of industry and the average value of the invoices. The charge for finance is comparable with overdraft rates (1.5–3 per cent over base rate). As on an overdraft, the interest is calculated on the daily outstanding balance of the funds that the borrowing firm has transferred to its business account. Added to this is a service charge that varies between 0.2 per cent and 3 per cent of invoiced sales. This is set at the higher end if there are many small invoices or a lot of customer accounts, or the risk is high.

Exhibit 3.16 shows the stages in a typical factoring transaction. First, goods are delivered to the customer and an invoice is sent. Second, the supplier sells the right to receive the invoice amount to a factor in return for, say, 80 per cent of the face value now. Third, some weeks later the customer pays the sum owing, which goes to the factor. Finally, the factor releases the remaining 20 per cent to the supplier less interest and fees.

Factors frequently reject clients as unsuitable for their services. The factor looks for 'clean and unencumbered debts' so that it can be reasonably certain of receiving invoice payments. It will also want to understand the company's business and to be satisfied with the competence of its management.

This form of finance has some advantages over bank borrowing. The factor does not impose financial ratio covenants or require fixed-asset backing. Also the fear of instant withdrawal of a facility (as with an overdraft) is absent as there is usually a notice period. The disadvantages are the raised cost and the unavailability of factoring to companies with many small-value transactions. Also, some managers say it removes a safety margin: instead of spending frugally while waiting for customers to pay, they may be tempted to splurge the advance.

Exhibit 3.16 Stages in a factoring deal

# 2 Sales ledger administration

Companies, particularly young and fast-growing ones, often do not want the trouble and expense of setting up a sophisticated system for dealing with the collection of outstanding debts. For a fee (0.75-2.5 per cent of turnover) factors will take over the functions of recording credit sales, checking customers' creditworthiness, sending invoices, chasing late payers and ensuring that debts are paid. Factors are experienced professional payment chasers who know all the tricks of the trade (such as 'the cheque is in the post' excuse) and so can obtain payment earlier. With factoring, sales ledger administration and debt collection generally come as part of the package offered by the finance house, unlike with invoice discounting (see below).

# 3 Credit insurance

The third service available from a factor is the provision of insurance against the possibility that a customer does not pay the amount owed. The charge for this service is generally between 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent of the value of the invoices.

# Invoice discounting

Firms with an annual turnover of less than  $10$  million typically use factoring (with sales ledger administration), whereas larger firms tend to use invoice discounting. Here invoices are pledged to the finance house in return for an immediate payment of up to 90 per cent of the face value. The supplying company guarantees to pay the amount represented on the invoices and is responsible for collecting the debt. The customers are generally totally unaware that the invoices have been discounted. When the due date is reached it is to be hoped that the customer has paid in full. Regardless of whether the customer has paid, the supplying firm is committed to handing over the total invoice amount to the finance house and in return receives the remaining 10 per cent less service fees and interest. Note that even invoice discounting is subject to the specific circumstances of the client agreement and is sometimes made on a non-recourse basis (the selling company does not have to recompense the factoring company if the customer fails to pay).

The finance provider usually advances money under invoice discounting only if the supplier's business is well established and profitable. There must be an effective and professional credit control and sales ledger administration system. Charges are usually lower than for factoring because the sales ledger administration is the responsibility of the supplying company.

# Hire purchase

With hire purchase (HP) the finance company buys the equipment that the borrowing firm needs. The equipment (plant, machinery, vehicles, etc.) belongs to the hire purchase company. However, the finance house allows the 'hirer' firm to use the equipment in return for a series of regular payments. These payments are sufficient to cover interest and contribute to paying off the principal. While the monthly instalments are still being made the HP company has the satisfaction and security of being the legal owner and so can take repossession if the hirer defaults on the payments. After all payments have been made the hirer becomes the owner, either automatically or on payment of a modest option-to-purchase fee. Nowadays, consumers buying electrical goods or vehicles have become familiar with sales assistants' attempts to sell an HP agreement also so that the customer pays over an extended period. Sometimes the finance is provided by the same organisation, but more often by a separate finance house.

Some examples of assets that may be acquired on HP are as follows:

- plant and machinery; business cars;
- commercial vehicles; agricultural equipment;
- hotel equipment; medical and dental equipment;

computers, including software; office equipment.

There are clearly some significant advantages of this form of finance, given the fact that hire purchase together with leasing has overtaken bank loans as a source of finance for UK business purchases up to £100,000. The main advantages are as follows:

- Small initial outlay The firm does not have to find the full purchase price at the outset. A deposit followed by a series of instalments can be less of a cash flow strain. The funds that the company retains by handing over merely a small deposit can be used elsewhere in the business for productive investment. Set against this are the relatively high interest charges (high relative to the rates a large firm can borrow at but can be relatively low for a small firm) and the additional costs of maintenance and insurance.
- Easy and quick to arrange Usually at point of sale, allowing immediate use of the asset.
- Certainty This is a medium-term source of finance which cannot be withdrawn provided contractual payments are made, unlike an overdraft. However, the commitment is made for a number of years and it could be costly to terminate the agreement. There are also budgeting advantages to the certainty of a regular cash outflow.
- HP is often available when other sources of finance are not. For some firms the equity markets are unavailable and banks will no longer lend to them, but HP companies will still provide funds as they have the security of the asset to reassure them.
- Fixed-rate finance In most cases the payments are fixed throughout the HP period. While the interest charged will not vary with the general interest rate throughout the life of the agreement, the hirer has to be aware that the HP company will quote an interest rate which is significantly different from the true annual percentage rate.

# Leasing

Leasing is similar to HP in that an equipment owner (the lessor) conveys the right to use the equipment in return for regular rental payments by the equipment user (the lessee) over an agreed period of time. The essential difference is that the lessee does not become the owner – the leasing company retains legal title. It is important to distinguish between operating leases and finance leases.

# Operating lease

Operating leases commit the lessee to only a short-term contract or one that can be terminated at short notice. These are certainly not expected to last for the entire useful life of the asset and so the finance house has the responsibility of finding an alternative use for the asset when the lessee no longer requires it. Perhaps the asset will be sold in the second-hand market, or it might be leased to another client. Either way the finance house bears the risk of ownership. If the equipment turns out to have become obsolete more quickly than was originally anticipated, it is the lessor that loses out. If the equipment is less reliable than expected, the owner (the finance house) will have to pay for repairs. Usually, with an operating lease, the lessor retains the obligation for repairs, maintenance and insurance.

It is clear why equipment which is subject to rapid obsolescence and frequent breakdown is often leased out on an operating lease. Photocopiers, for example, used by a university department are far better leased so that if they break down the university staff do not have to deal with the problem. In addition, the latest model can be quickly installed in the place of an outdated one.

The most common form of operating lease is contract hire. These leases are often used for a fleet of vehicles. The leasing company takes some responsibility for the management and maintenance of the vehicles and for disposal of the vehicles at the end of the contract hire period (after 12-48 months).

Operating leases are also useful if the business involves a short-term project requiring the use of an asset for a limited period. For example, building firms often use equipment supplied under an operating lease (sometimes called plant hire). Operating leases are not confined to small items of equipment. There is a growing market in leasing aircraft and ships for periods less than the economic life of the asset, thus making these deals operating leases. Many of Boeing's and Airbus's aircraft go to leasing firms.

# Finance lease

Under a finance lease (also called a capital lease or a full payout lease) the finance provider expects to recover the full cost (or almost the full cost) of the equipment, plus interest, over the period of the lease. With this type of lease the lessee usually has no right of cancellation or termination. Despite the absence of legal ownership the lessee will have to bear the risks and rewards that normally go with ownership: the lessee will usually be responsible for maintenance, insurance and repairs and suffer the frustrations of demand being below expectations or the equipment becoming obsolete more rapidly than anticipated.

Most finance leases contain a primary and a secondary period. It is during the primary period that the lessor receives the capital sum plus interest. In the secondary period the lessee pays a very small, 'nominal' rental payment. If the company does not want to continue using the equipment in the secondary period it may be sold second-hand to an unrelated company.

# Advantages of leasing

For companies that become lessees the advantages listed for hire purchase also apply: small initial outlay, certainty, available when other finance sources are not, fixed-rate finance and tax relief. There is an additional advantage of operating leases and that is the transfer of obsolescence risk to the finance provider.

# Islamic banking

Under Islamic Sharia law the payment of  $riba^5$  (interest) is prohibited and the receiver of finance must not bear all the risk of failure. Also investment in alcohol, tobacco, pornography or gambling is not allowed. However, Islam does encourage entrepreneurial activity and the sharing of risk through equity shares. Thus a bank can create profit-sharing products to offer customers. Depositors can be offered a percentage of the bank's profits rather than a set interest rate. Borrowers repay the bank an amount that is related to the profit produced by the project for which the loan was made. Some examples include:

- Musharakah A joint enterprise is established by the bank and borrower. Both contribute capital plus management and labour (although some parties, e.g. banks, contribute little other than capital). Profit (loss) is shared in pre-agreed proportions – there is a prohibition against a fixed lump sum for any party. All partners have unlimited liability. Thus for a house purchase the property is purchased by the bank and clients (perhaps 10 per cent of the purchase price). The customer purchases the bank's share gradually, until he is made sole owner after a specified period, usually 25 years. Over the financing period, the bank's share is rented to the customer.
- Ijara Example: a house (or aircraft, say) is bought by the bank and rented to the 'mortgage holder'. The house title may or may not be transferred when the contract ends.
- Murabaha Example: a bank buys a house (car, or other property) and sells it to the customer at a fixed price – more than the bank paid – permitting the customer to pay in monthly installments. When the final instalment is paid the house is transferred to the customer.

More than 600 banks and financial institutions offer services according to Sharia law. They are most heavily concentrated in the Arabian Gulf countries, Malaysia, Pakistan and Iran. But many conventional banks also offer Sharia products, e.g. HSBC and Lloyds have Islamic mortgages available. Growth has been driven by the rising consciousness in Islamic principles over the last 40 years and the rising wealth of Muslim oil states. What is regarded as compliant with Sharia in one part of the world may not be considered by Islamic scholars to be acceptable in another. Malaysia, for example, tends to be more liberal than Saudi Arabia.

The UK has introduced tax, $^{6}$  legislative and regulatory changes to encourage Islamic financial services in the City. This has been successful, attracting over US10 billion of funds to London, making it one of the top ten centres. Despite its growth, the volume of Islamic finance is still only around 1 per cent of the size of the conventional finance industry. Increasingly, Islamic products are being used by non-Muslims, sometimes due to religious conviction, e.g. Quakers, or because that form of finance has qualities they are looking for – see Exhibit 3.17.

# Exhibit 3.17

# Investment strategy about more than faith

FT

# Emmanuelle Smith

Despite, or maybe because of the world's economic travails, Islamic finance has continued to stride ahead, as investors seek alternatives to products that have let them down in the recent past.

According to Maris Strategies, assets in Islamic finance rose to 822bn last year, an increase of 29 per cent compared with 2008.

Much of this can be attributed to a growing Muslim population wanting to invest according to the guiding principles of their faith.

But non-Muslims are also attracted to Islamic finance. Gulf African Bank, for example, reported last year that 20 per cent of its customer base was non-Muslim.

Jo Divanna, managing director of Maris Strategies and a leading commentator on the subject, partly attributes this to a conscious effort by companies to widen their appeal by changing terminology.

He says: "Islamic finance is undergoing a rebranding towards western markets by reducing the use of the term Islamic or sharia and focusing instead on the concepts of ethical and green."

"This is not to say they are lowering their standards," he adds, but "simply redefining their image".

Another explanation for the surge of interest is dissatisfaction with conventional finance in the wake of the global financial crisis. So, might the inherently prudent principles of Islamic finance have prevented lending to people who were likely to default, for example?

According to sharia law, the selling of loans is not permitted, nor is interest-bearing debt more generally - all factors that contribute to the crisis.

However, Iqbal Asaria, who teaches an Islamic finance elective at Cass Business School in London, dismisses the argument that the financial crisis could somehow have been averted had Islamic principles been more prevalent.

"The [crisis] was caused by a number of factors, including minimal attention to prudential regulation. These lapses will affect any form of finance - Islamic or conventional."

Mr Divanna agrees, stressing that Islamic finance is not a replacement for conventional finance, but rather than alternative: "There are still risks in lending and facilitating transactions. Islamic finance does not provide safeguards; it merely provides an alternative method of providing services under a unique set of disciplines."

"Sharia-principles are interpretive, so how products work in various parts of the world is different," says Mr Divanna.

"There is a clear difference in attitudes between Muslims in the Gulf, Malaysia, Europe, North Africa and southern Asia," he adds.

# Concluding comments

Evidently, there is much more to modern banking than simply taking deposits, making loans and running a payments mechanism. Banking has branched out into many new areas and taken many different forms. Banks form the bedrock of any sophisticated financial system because the banks lie at the centre of the financial markets, acting as market makers, brokers, advisers, investment managers or traders. They facilitate the functioning of the bond and equity capital markets as well as the foreign exchange, commodities and a host of other markets. Despite the outsized rewards that bankers often receive, few of us would say that they do not, on the whole, provide socially useful services – despite our anger over the financial crisis. However, there are some pockets of activities (e.g. many exotic derivative transactions, securitisations and zero-sum-game proprietary trading) where commentators have questioned whether any real value is created for society, or merely high bonuses for the bankers. But these areas of criticism should not lead us to heap opprobrium on all bankers – the vast majority help us in so many ways.

# Key points and concepts
- Investment banks - complex organisations offering a wide range of financial services (excluding high-street banking), charging fees and commissions for advice and making arrangements on matters such as mergers, raising of capital for a corporation and risk control.
- They perform some loss-leading activities to strengthen relationships with clients for the benefit of future profit making. To maximise profits they need to coordinate activities and sell a variety of services to clients.
Employees are often very highly paid because of the amount of business they generate and the influence they have over their clients. Typically, investment banks put aside 50 per cent of income for paying employees.
Some suggested reasons for high investment bank profits:
- due to the complexity and size of transactions, there are very few banks able to carry them out therefore there are some elements of oligopolistic power; their reputation for profitable dealing gives them a considerable degree of influence and their advice carries credence and authority;
- the extent and variety of their dealings give them superior information.
- Global investment banks are active in a number of countries. 'Bulge bracket' is the term used for the leaders, such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, able to handle large deals and a variety of services.
- 'Boutique' investment banks are smaller investment banks which concentrate on particular areas, usually mergers and acquisitions.

Advice on financing and raising finance:

- Investment banks have great expertise and knowledge and charge commission on all finance-raising transactions
- They help with issuing initial public offerings, rights issues, further share issues, bonds, project finance, sale and leaseback, and overseas trade
- They underwrite new security and equity issues
- They assist with the issue of bills of exchange and banker's acceptances.

Mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructuring:

- Investment banks earn very large fees from using their expertise to advise companies
Divestiture - the selling-off of a subsidiary
- Restructure debt - changing of debt structure (e.g. extending the time to pay) to suit the company's present circumstances
- Strategic review - usually meaning that the company is amenable to a takeover.
- Relationship manager – an investment bank employee who builds up a special long-term relationship with a particular company.
- Risk management by investment banks is the reducing of risks, particularly on interest rate or foreign currency movements. They also assist companies when they have a temporary surplus of cash and need to invest it well but without undue risk.
- Investment banks can advise on lending and obtaining the best loans at favourable rates.
- Investment banks advised the UK government on privatisation (the selling-off of state-owned assets).
- Investment banks assist with the setting up of public-private partnerships (PPPs), which allow private firms to build and operate a facility (e.g. a prison) in return for an income flow.

- They act as corporate brokers to companies, advising on regulations and all aspects of bond and equity issuance. They may offer services to retail and wholesale investor clients as well, advising on, and facilitating, the buying and selling of securities.

Market making or dealing: they facilitate the buying and selling of shares by offering bid (buying) and offer or ask (selling) prices.

Market makers operate a quote-driven trading system

- The bid-offer spread or trader's spread is the margin a market maker makes, the difference between buying and selling prices
- Clearing price is the price of a share where buying and selling demand is matched
- Proprietary trading is using an investment bank's capital to make trading profit (trading income).
- 'Chinese walls' is the term used by investment banks to explain how they do not take advantage of inside knowledge because information is not passed from one part of the bank to another.
- Fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading is carried out by investment banks on behalf of clients. It generates large amounts of income trading in a wide variety of bonds, credit and interest rate derivatives, money market instruments and bank loans. Currency and commodity trading is for both spot and derivative deals.
- Investment banks assist their clients in all aspect of equity trading as well as acting as market makers or brokers in the derivative markets. They also create derivatives and market them to clients.

Securitisation is the bundling together of a group of assets, such as the right to receive interest and principal from mortgages, that can then be sold on and traded, enabling the originator to take on more debt. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is an independent entity containing a bundle of assets.

- Asset management (of investment funds) is carried out by investment banks on behalf of charities, pension funds or companies and individuals.
- Investment banks also provide investment advice. Private-client representatives give advice to individual investors. An institutional sales force gives advice to professional funds.
- Investment banks provide wealth management and private banking – services and advice to improve the management of the financial affairs of high-net-worth individuals, including their investments, current deposit accounts, obtaining of loans and tax issues.
- Some investment banks offer a prime brokerage service for hedge funds – acting as a broker buying and selling blocks of shares (trade execution), derivatives, etc. for the fund, clearing and settlement of trades, risk management, back-office accounting services, cash management, custodial services and introductory services.
- Investment banks assist with, and occasionally provide funds for, private equity (venture capital) trading in unquoted companies.
- International banking is banking business conducted across national borders and/or with foreign currencies.

## Different Types of International Banking
- For nationals at home
- For non-nationals at home
- Eurocurrency banking is with money deliberately held outside the control of the regulators and governments of the currency
Cross-border
- For own nationals in foreign country
In multiple currencies and countries

Financial markets dealing for own account

- Locating functional operations around the globe.
- Correspondent banking: a well-established bank in the country is asked to undertake tasks for clients of the foreign bank.
- Representative office: small, rudimentary affairs that assist the parent bank's customers in that country. They might provide information on the country to clients and help them form banking and business relationships in the country. However, they cannot provide core overseas banking business to clients.
- An agency office is a greater commitment than a representative office. They are usually prohibited from accepting deposits from host-country residents, but can be used to transfer other funds and make loans. They are not subject to the same full regulatory requirements as the host country banks.
- A branch of the parent bank legally acts as part of the overall bank to provide as full a range of banking services as the banking regulators in the host country allow. Branches do not maintain capital reserves in the host country.
- A subsidiary, set up as a separate legal entity in the host country, will be subject to the same regulations as the host-country banks. It has its own capital reserves kept within the country and has to follow the same regulatory procedures as the host-country banks.
- Banks run as mutuals are member-owned rather than owned by shareholders. The members are usually depositors (or depositors plus borrowers together). Profits are either distributed to members or they are ploughed back into the business. They are called by a number of different names, including mutuals, thrifts, building societies, cooperative banks, savings and loans, savings banks, people's banks, community banks and credit unions.
Advantages mutuals have over corporate banks:
- do not have to pay returns to shareholders which, at least in theory, allows them to offer better rates to savers and borrowers;
- culture of cautious risk taking, thus they are better positioned to survive a financial crisis – but they are not always cautious.

A general drawback with many mutuals is that they are vulnerable to going through a poor patch because they do not have shareholders to turn to for fresh capital in a crisis.

Factoring companies provide at least three services:

- providing finance on the security of trade debts;
- sales ledger administration; credit insurance.
- Invoice discounting is the obtaining of money on the security of book debts; usually confidential and with recourse to the supplying firm. The supplying firm manages the sales ledger.
- Hire purchase is an agreement to hire goods for a specified period, with an option or an automatic right to purchase the goods at the end for a nominal or zero final payment.
Leasing The legal owner of an asset gives another person or firm (the lessee) the possession of that asset to use in return for specified rental payments. Note that ownership is not transferred to the lessee.
An operating lease commits the lessee to only a short-term contract, less than the useful life of the asset.
A finance lease commits the lessee to a contract for the substantial part of the useful life of the asset.
- Islamic banking: under Islamic Sharia law the payment of riba (interest) is prohibited and the receiver of finance must not bear all the risk of failure. Also, investment in alcohol, tobacco, pornography or gambling is not allowed. However, Islam does encourage entrepreneurial activity and the sharing of risk through equity shares. Thus a bank can create profit-sharing products to offer customers.
