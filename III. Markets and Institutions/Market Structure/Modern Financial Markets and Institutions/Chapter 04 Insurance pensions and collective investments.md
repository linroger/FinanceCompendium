## Insurance

In the twenty-first century, insurance plays a large and important role in society worldwide. According to Swiss Re, a leading global reinsurer, $^{1}$  in 2009  \$4,100 billion$ ^{2} of insurance premiums were paid. This equates to roughly  $\$600$  for every single human being in the world. It is a vast industry, nearly doubling the amount of premiums paid in the past ten years, and impinges on everybody's life. It is an important source of overseas income to the countries which provide it, and plays a vital role in commerce by taking away from companies the risk that they would be forced out of business by, say, a fire on their premises. Instead of being faced by financial ruin, that risk is assumed by the insurance company in return for a carefully calculated premium.

Figures from Swiss Re show that in 2009 the UK had an 8 per cent share of the insurance market, third behind the US and Japan (see Exhibit 4.1). There was an overall worldwide 2.8 per cent decline in premiums compared with 2008, due mainly to a decline in the number of life insurance premiums, especially in the UK where financial crises and economic turmoil caused a

Global premiums received 2009 drop in premiums written of more than 21 per cent. Many UK residents use life insurance as a means of saving, and in trying times save less.

There are also offshore tax haven countries which specialise in insurance. The largest of these is Bermuda, a self-governing British overseas territory, where company taxes are significantly lower than in most countries. Thanks to its position as a financial centre where most of the world's large insurance companies have a base, Bermuda has one of the highest per capita GDPs in the world, and is the biggest centre for reinsurance, a specialised form of insurance, where insurance companies insure their insurance business against loss. Bermuda, New York and London make up the three main centres of reinsurance.

### History of insurance

Insurance in some form has been in existence since ancient times, when traders faced the risk of financial ruin if their cargoes met with disaster. Traders might contribute to a fund from which those who suffered loss could claim some compensation. As trading developed and increased, rich businessmen would agree to pay for part of any losses in return for a sum of money, and would sign a contract to this effect, writing their name under the wording of the contract; this is where the term underwriting originates.

The first modern-day insurance companies were fire insurance companies formed after the Great Fire of London in 1666: Hand in Hand (1696), Sun Fire Office (1710) and the Royal Exchange Assurance (1753). During the same period in London, a certain Edward Lloyd's coffee house became a centre for meetings of people with commercial interest in the rapidly expanding shipping industry (see the section on Lloyds of London later in this chapter).

### Why do we need insurance?

In life, things go wrong – the car breaks down, the house is flooded, or an ocean tanker goes aground and spills its cargo of oil. In return for a premium, insurance offers customers financial compensation should any of these, or indeed other, things occur. Rather than take the risk upon themselves and maybe find that they are saddled with a large unexpected expense which they cannot meet, people and companies prefer to pay out a premium to insure against risk, even though they could go through the whole of their life paying premiums every year and never making a claim.

### Insurance firms

Insurance firms are either normal companies owned by shareholders or mutual organisations which are owned by their policy holders. The insurance firms' task is to make sure that they understand the risks involved and that they receive more in premiums than they pay out in claims and running costs. This has become more difficult with our increasingly litigious society, and the advent of new and expensive-to-replace technology, pollution and modern-day diseases such as AIDS and cancer.

Insurance firms are regulated by domestic legislation, but where they establish offices abroad, these may be subject to less regulation, especially in tax-haven countries such as Bermuda.

For the remainder of the chapter, for brevity insurance mutuals will be included in the term insurance company.

### Insurance underwriting

Underwriters work for insurance companies, assessing the risk involved and setting the terms and cost of the premium to be paid. Underwriting is a complex job and has to take into account any number of variables, while coming up with a premium that is both profitable to the insurance company and acceptable (competitive) to its customers. Because of the complexity involved, underwriters usually specialise in one particular type of insurance, such as motor, life, business, etc., so that they can build up their knowledge base and make sound decisions which will make money for their company but also attract custom. A lot of their decisions are based on historical statistics, which help them analyse the risk involved and the likelihood of a claim being made. The greater the number of statistics available, the easier it is to predict risk. It is all a balancing act, and the underwriters' task is to ensure that the balance is weighted in favour of the company.

### Asymmetric information

There are various pitfalls which can trap the unwary underwriter or customer into making a bad decision. Asymmetric information is when one party in a negotiation or relationship is not in the same position as the other parties, being ignorant of, or unable to observe, some information which is essential to the contracting and decision-making process. Thus, while insurance companies ask prospective policy holders to give a lot of information when trying to assess the level of risk exposure, the client will always know more than the insurer.

Adverse selection occurs when there is an opportunity or incentive for some firms/individuals to act to take advantage of their informational edge over others. Then the firms/individuals doing that activity will be disproportionately those taking advantage rather than being truly representative of the population as a whole, e.g. the tendency for poorer-than-average risks to continue with insurance. This will raise the cost of insurance for the whole group, including those of less-than-average risk. Thus there is a proclivity for people in dangerous jobs or with high-risk lifestyles to buy insurance, knowing that insurance premiums are based on averages and that they will therefore be at an advantage. Insurance companies and their underwriters try to cover this by limiting the insurance offered or by increasing premiums, but may then find that fewer people subsequently buy insurance cover.

Moral hazard recognises the danger that someone who is insured may be more likely to take risks and be less careful because they are insured – someone might not bother to lock their car 'because it's insured anyway', for instance. Insurers try to minimise this problem by decreasing the amount paid out in a claim, e.g. increasing the excess (the loss that the policy holder bears before the insurer pays out) to be paid if the car is not locked.

### The insurance process

Insurance is sold in a variety of ways:

- direct from an insurer at one of their offices, over the phone, or via the internet, which is becoming increasingly popular; through an agent who usually works for one insurer;
- through an insurance broker or independent intermediary who is not normally tied to any one particular insurer. Brokers are paid commission on policy sales and are able to search for the most suitable policy;
- through a bank, building society, solicitor, travel agent, mail-order agent or accountant, who will receive commission on sales.

Wherever policies are obtained, the process is the same: a proposal form with relevant questions is completed and sent to the underwriter for assessment of the risk. If information given on proposals is incorrect, the insurance will be invalid.

### Types of insurance

Insurance can be split into two types: life (or long-term insurance) and general (or non-life insurance). Both generate significant amounts of money in premiums (see Exhibit 4.2), with life policies taking the greater share – approximately 60 per cent compared to approximately 40 per cent for general insurance.

## Life/long-term insurance

Life insurance includes a variety of insurance policies to cover people in different ways for loss of life, usually their own. Many life policies allow the insured to add money into the policy amount beyond what is needed for payouts on death, so if the insured is still alive after, say, ten years, a sum of money is received. Thus for many people it is a way of saving, and the insurance companies have to attract customers and compete against other forms of saving.

- Term assurance, in return for premiums, covers the policy holder for a set amount of time and will pay out if the policy holder dies within that set time. If the insured survives over the specified period, then no payment is made
- Whole-of-life cover is more costly than term assurance because it is guaranteed to pay out when the insured dies as long as the premiums are up to date. The premiums tend to rise as the insured ages to cover the increased likelihood of mortality.
- Endowment policies are principally savings vehicles and pay out a set amount at a set future date (or on the earlier death of the insured) in return for premiums paid. They may be 'without profits', in which case they pay out just the amount set at the start of the policy, or 'with profits', where the insured receives a bonus each year in the shape of a share of the fund's returns from investments made (if it makes a positive return) and at the maturity of the policy these accrued profits are repaid to the insured. These policies are often linked to mortgages, where the insured pays only the interest on their mortgage and the policy at maturity pays off the mortgage.
- Annuities provide a regular income until the death of the insured in return for a lump-sum payment. The insurance company takes the lump sum and invests in the financial markets and elsewhere to make a return.
Insurance companies may also run pension schemes for individuals - see later in the chapter.

## General/non-life insurance

This encompasses all other types of insurance. It is usually renewed annually and the premium may be adjusted when required. There are broadly three categories:

- Property insurance covers personal and business properties and contents against fire, theft, weather damage, and can also include terrorism, earthquake, domestic appliances and other perils. Open policies cover all loss or damage not specifically excluded, while named peril policies require the perils covered to be listed.
- Casualty insurance includes aviation and marine insurance, car insurance, travel insurance, private medical insurance, pet insurance, accident, sickness or unemployment insurance, critical illness insurance and long-term care insurance.
- Liability insurance protects the insured against third-party claims and includes employers' liability, public liability (e.g. a member of the public being hurt by falling masonry from a building site), product liability, pollution liability and commercial fleet liability (e.g. companies that use vehicles as part of their business will have all their vehicles covered by one policy, so that if any of their fleet is involved in an accident, the vehicle and its driver are fully covered by insurance).

### What do insurance companies do with the premiums?

All insurance companies take in premiums constantly and they are therefore in possession of a substantial 'pool' or 'float' of ready cash which they are able to invest in various ways - see Exhibit 4.3 for UK insurance companies' investments.

The distinction between the different types of insurance is important, as the type of business carried out influences the treatment of the premium income. General insurance companies must keep enough in cash or very liquid assets such as money market instruments to be able to pay out on claims whenever they occur. Usually, the amount needed to satisfy claims can be predicted, but in the case of a natural disaster, such as flooding or an earthquake, or in the case of an unusual run of claims, the insurance companies need to be able to pay out large sums of money very quickly. If their underwriters do their job efficiently, their float will grow steadily, and if invested wisely can be a great source of revenue, as well as being a buffer against an excessive number of claims being made.

US investor Warren Buffett is an enthusiastic believer in the advantages of investing in a well-run insurance company, which can then produce a constant stream of 'free' (i.e. free of any interest costs) money, which in turn can generate profits through investments. His company Berkshire Hathaway's float was  \$17.3 million in 1967; by 2011, this float had grown to\$ 66 billion. He deliberately bought other insurance companies so that he could apply his investment skills to their floats.

Life insurance companies are able to predict to a far greater extent when they will need to pay out any claims. Their underwriters use sophisticated statistical analysis to work out when claims are likely to need to be met. Therefore they do not require their assets to be readily available and can invest in longer-term investments such as bonds and company shares.

Exhibit 4.4 shows the amount of assets under the control of insurance companies in 2008 in six of the countries pre-eminent in insurance: 15,394 billion for these six countries. The investments they make are crucial to the viability of their companies. They can also have a significant influence on financial markets.

If insurance companies fail to do their underwriting or to invest their assets competently, they run the risk of not being able to pay out on claims, but even if they are managed efficiently, they could still suffer from a stretch of bad luck and run out of funds. Insurance companies need several years of profits to make up for a bad year on claims, and each year a number of companies fail when their capital has diminished to the point where it is likely that they will be unable to meet their insurance liabilities. Between 1969 and 1998 in the US insurance companies alone suffered more than 640 insolvencies. Governments worldwide have increased regulations on insurance companies to ensure that they have sufficient financial funding and are run efficiently. In the UK since 2001 the Financial Services Authority (Financial Conduct Authority from 2013) has overseen all insurance companies, including Lloyds. In the EU, there will be a new directive in 2012, Solvency II, which will aim to implement solvency requirements (keeping a good reserve of capital) that better reflect the risks that companies face and to deliver a supervisory system that is consistent across all member states.

### Reinsurance

Reinsurance has evolved as an effective means of coping with the growing number and increasingly complex nature of risks. It is the process by which insurance companies lessen their exposure to risk by transferring the risk to a reinsurer. By transferring all or part of the risk, the insurance company is able to accept more or larger risks from a client. Insurers should only underwrite risk in proportion to the amount of capital they possess, so reinsurance is a way to expand their business without the need to raise further capital.

Reinsurance can be proportional or non-proportional.

- Proportional reinsurance is taken out for part of one particular risk, or part of all risks, and protects the original insurer against legitimate but unforeseeable or extraordinary losses. If a reinsurer takes on 45 per cent of a risk, they receive 45 per cent of the premium and in the event of a claim will pay out 45 per cent of the claim. An insurance company might ask a reinsurer to take on a percentage of all its business, say 20 per cent, and the reinsurer, in return for 20 per cent of all premiums, would assume responsibility for paying out 20 per cent of every claim. The original insurer receives a ceding commission as a thank you for providing business to the reinsurer.
- Non-proportional reinsurance is taken out to cover loss over a certain amount. For example, if an insurance company insures a shipping company against loss of 5\mathrm{m}, it could choose to reinsure any loss in excess of, say, 1\mathrm{m}, or 4\mathrm{m}.

Reinsurance is often split between a number of reinsurance companies to spread the risk, so that in the event of a large claim being made, no single company stands the whole amount. The ten largest reinsurance companies are shown in Exhibit 4.5. They all have offices worldwide and skilful underwriters to undertake this complex task. Most of these companies carry out direct insurance as well.

Exhibit 4.5 Largest global reinsurers (2009)

The purchase of reinsurance by reinsurance companies is known as retrocession. It is entirely possible for a reinsurance company to unknowingly reinsure itself by taking on part of a risk that it has distributed among other reinsurance companies, which in turn redistribute the risk; this is known as spiralling.

### The London market

The London market is a separate part of the UK insurance and reinsurance business centred in the City of London, and comprises Lloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates, Protection and Indemnity (P & I) Clubs and members of the IUA (the International Underwriting Association of London). Together they provide international general insurance and reinsurance for complex large commercial risks. It is the only market in which all of the world's 20 largest reinsurance groups are represented. The amount of expertise available from these insurers means that brokers are able to underwrite just about any type of risk. Business is facilitated by their geographical proximity, with every kind of ancillary service providers, such as lawyers and IT, close at hand. The close community of specialist insurers and support service providers means that information spread is rapid and deals can be made quickly.

Exhibit 4.6 shows how the London market was conducted over the ten years from 2000 to 2009 and how it expanded to generate some £24,651 million in premiums.

### IUA

The International Underwriting Association is the world's largest organisation for international and wholesale insurance and reinsurance companies. It was formed in 1998 by the merger of two separate bodies which previously represented marine and non-marine insurance.

### P & I Clubs

Protection and Indemnity (P & I) Clubs (often called Marine P & I Clubs) have been in existence for over 140 years and offer protection and indemnity (insurance) in respect of third-party liabilities and expenses arising from owning or operating ships. They do not cover the actual ships or their cargoes, but do cover third-party risks such as collision, pollution, injury to or loss of life of passengers or crew members, and a long list of others. They are run on a mutual basis (owned by members and not run for profit), although there has recently been a trend towards demutualisation and the provision of insurance cover with fixed premiums.

## Lloyd's

Edward Lloyd is believed to have opened his coffee house in Tower Street, London in 1688, and it soon became a meeting place for people with interests in shipping. In 1769 a group of underwriters and brokers moved to other premises, naming them 'New Lloyds Coffee House'. When these premises became too small, the group of 79 each put in £100 and leased and became joint owners of what was henceforth called Lloyd's of London or just Lloyd's. Business, and the expertise of the underwriters and brokers, grew, and in 1871 an Act of Parliament gave Lloyd's authority to acquire property and enact byelaws. Lloyd's had become an established business institution not only in British society but throughout the trading world.

The proficiency and experience of Lloyd's underwriters preserves its position at the forefront of the property and casualty insurance business, and their ability and willingness to undertake unusual risks keeps them in the public eye. Lloyd's is a place where customers, brokers and underwriters meet face to face and discuss requirements. Exhibit 4.7 gives the percentage breakdown of the insurance cover which they underwrote in 2009. More than half of the business is with North or South Americans; only 20 per cent of business is with UK individuals and organisations. Lloyd's members write insurance in over 80 jurisdictions and write reinsurance in more than 200 countries and territories.

Among the more interesting risks that Lloyd's syndicates have underwritten are Father Christmas's beard, the 1981 Derby winner Shergar, which was owned by a syndicate of individuals when it was kidnapped in 1983 (payments were made to horse syndicate members who were insured for theft, but not to those who insured for loss of life), the legs of Betty Grable (1 million each leg) and Michael Flatley (47 million!), Ken Dodd's teeth, accidental injury to any of The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen's voice (6 million), the taste buds of Egon Ronay, the risk that Queen Victoria's first born would be twins, and death from excessive laughter (this cover was taken out in the 1920s when the early comedic films were shown for the first time and had a dramatic effect on their audience).

#### The structure of Lloyd's

Lloyd's is not an insurance company, it is a society of members – that is, a group of members who trade in insurance via brokers, in an environment run by the Corporation of Lloyd's, which is overseen by the Council of Lloyd's.

For a long time it was made up of individuals (Names) who underwrote particular risks and joined together in syndicates to underwrite an ever larger range of risks of modern life. Syndicates ran (and still run) for one year only, then closed, and other syndicates would be formed, sometimes identical in membership to the one just closed, sometimes with some or all different members. Because claims take some time to become apparent, three years after opening the syndicates accounts are closed, profit taken and any liabilities taken into consideration. However, instead of putting aside reserves of cash to pay for these ongoing liabilities, it became common practice to reinforce them, usually with the same syndicate. In this way, it was possible for losses to accumulate year after year, and it was possible for new members to be liable for losses from years ago. This resulted in meltdown in the late 1980s and 1990s, following a string of natural disasters – the explosion of the Piper Alpha oil rig, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, an earthquake in San Francisco, and Hurricane Hugo – which were combined with US courts awarding huge damages for asbestosis, pollution and health hazards; some of the claims involved all-liability policies and dated back tens of years. For more than 300 years, individual underwriting members had accepted unlimited personal liability for the policies they signed and now they were faced with paying out huge claims dating back a long time.

Lloyd's had gone through a profitable time and a huge expansion in the number of Names since the 1950s, when there were just over 3,000 members, to a high of more than 32,000 in 1988. Faced with financial ruin, many Names refused to pay out and sued Lloyd's for accepting their membership but not fully revealing the historic liabilities. From 1988 to 1992 Lloyd's suffered continual losses totalling nearly £8 billion, and the resignation of thousands of Names.

This brought about a complete reorganisation of Lloyd's. A separate insurance company called Equitas funded by a levy on members was formed in 1996 to take over all pre-1992 liabilities (Equitas was taken over by one of the companies controlled by Warren Buffett in 2006). For the first time, limited liability companies and institutions were allowed to be members and no new unlimited liability members were admitted, resulting in the steady decline of individual unlimited liability Names. This has had a dramatic effect on Lloyd's membership (see Exhibit 4.8). The

Central Fund was established, a levy on all premiums, to be used if members are unable to meet claims (now with over £2 billion), underwriting and risk management were improved and syndicates had to produce a business plan which met with the approval of the Corporation of Lloyd's.

Individuals or businesses wishing to invest in Lloyd's must have £350,000 in assets in reserve and about £200,000 in cash that they can place in Lloyd's as back-up for underwriting losses, should they occur. They are then able to buy the right to be a syndicate member and take a share in the syndicate's profit.

Exhibit 4.9 shows where Lloyd's syndicates get their capital from. Clearly, most of it now comes from the worldwide insurance industry rather than from individuals.

At the centre of the Lloyd's system are the 80 or so syndicates that accept the insurance risk. Brokers working for the clients needing insurance shop around and negotiate a deal with one or more syndicates. Managing agents are responsible for managing a syndicate and the whole system is supervised by the Corporation of Lloyd's – see Exhibit 4.10.

Exhibit 4.11 describes the stages a new Name has to go through to underwrite insurance risk.

Money has to be kept in reserve and invested in safe and easily liquidated financial assets to meet the claims of policy holders. Lloyd's tries to be ultra-safe by having three pots of money. The first comes from premiums paid, the second from money supplied by members and the third from a central fund which is topped up by members each year - see Exhibit 4.12.

The article in Exhibit 4.13 shows where the money held in each of these three funds was invested and discusses the current debate about the temptation to invest in less liquid and more risky securities to obtain higher returns.

These are the capital providers that accept the insurance risk via syndicates. Included are major insurance groups, companies (some listed on stock markets), individuals and limited partnerships. Private members typically support a number of syndicates. Corporate members usually underwrite through a single syndicate. Members choose which syndicate(s) to participate in for the following year (most stick with the same for many years)

Scores of high-net-worth investors are already expressing an interest in signing up as Lloyd's Names to profit from next year's underwrit ing cycle for the London insurance market.

The way to follow suit is to join one of the three Lloyd's mem bers' agents, Alpha, Argentina or Hampden. These groups set up limited liability underwriting vehicles and represent clients seeking

# Exhibit 4.11 continued to invest in particular syndicates at Lloyd's capacity auctions, held in September.

Members tend to support a variety of syndicates and spread their risk by underwriting different classes of insurance and reinsurance.

The costs of investing in the Lloyd's market remain high, as investors must have at least  \$350,000 in assets, which is used as collateral, and about\$ 200,000 in cash, which is used to buy the rights to participate in the profits of syndicates.

Another  $\S 7,000$  to  $\S 10,000$  is required to start a limited liability partnership (LLP), which must be set up by the end of August to participate in the auctions for the 2010 account.

Prospective members can also purchase an existing LLP.

Members who have set up a limited liability underwriting vehicle must then deposit funds at Lloyd's in November to support their underwriting capacity for the following year.

To write a premium income limit of  \$1m for the 2010 year, for example, an account would require a\$ 400,000 deposit, in the form of cash, shares or bank guarantees.

Funds deposited are geared by about 2.5 times.

Syndicate capacity bought by members in a particular year is a tradeable asset which can gain or lose capital value and also pay yearly dividends in the form of underwriting profit.

High-net-worth investors are attracted to the market for several reasons.

Losses are now capped, as investors can now only underwrite a group of syndicates through a LLP, which means that the maximum loss they face will be restricted to the capital pledged upfront.

A second benefit is that assets invested in Lloyd's can be used twice to achieve returns. For example, an investor could put up, say, a buy-to-let property or a share portfolio as collateral.

This allows investors to earn a double return on their assets. Also, any losses can be offset against income tax.

# Exhibit 4.12 The three sources of capital to back up insurance promises at Lloyd's

First: syndicate-level assets ('premium trust fund')

Premiums on policies received by a syndicate are held in its trust fund ready to pay out on claims (over £37bn in 2010)

Second: Members' funds at Lloyd's

Each Member provides capital to support underwriting in case claims exceed premiums. This capital is held in trust as readily saleable assets to meet any Lloyd's insurance liabilities of that Member, but not the liabilities of other Members (over £13bn in 2010)

Third: Central Fund

A further back-up is the Corporation's central assets to meet valid claims that cannot be met by the Member. Members have to pay an annual contribution to maintain it (over £2bn in 2010)

# Steve Johnson

Not many investors managed to sail serenely through the financial crisis with scarcely a care in the world, but Lloyd's of London, the 322-year-old insurance market, was among this select band.

The insurance market's conservative investment strategy, heavy in government and corporate bonds, saw it chalk up annual returns of 5.6 per cent in 2007, 2.5 per cent in 2008 and 4 per cent in 2009.

In spite of this, there are signs that the 52 managing agents, the underwriters that manage the 84 syndicates and hold  $46\mathrm{bn}$  ( $70\mathrm{bn},$ 52 $\mathrm{bn}$ ) of investable assets, are starting to embrace a little more risk.

The change is being driven by the increasingly paltry returns available on short duration investment-grade debt and the fact that the notoriously cyclical underwriting market appears to be softening, putting pressure on agents to generate returns from the asset side of their balance sheet.

Others see a similar trend. David Osborne, senior consultant at Meridian, the largest consultancy in the Lloyd's market, says: "People are having to re-think their attitude to risk. If they take all the risk off the table and put the money in cash deposits they earn nothing in practice. It's a more difficult set of problems than the insurance market has ever faced before."

Russell Büss, head of institutional fixed income at Amundi, which manages £2.6bn on behalf of 15 managing agents and 20 syndicates, adds: "The last underwriting cycle was pretty weak and people are trying to make their reserves work harder."

Managing agents have traditionally been highly conservative investors, with the bulk of their assets held in short duration government bonds and investment-trade credit.

These assets, alongside letters of credit provided by banks, still dominate the three layers of

Investment returns \% capital; members' trust funds, which hold premium income; members' funds at Lloyd's, which holds the capital each syndicate must put up to support its underwriting activity; and the central fund, a mutual fund that provides a backstop for large claims.

However, Robin Creswell, managing principal of Payden & Rygel Global, which manages 5bn for insurance organisations, says some of the larger Lloyd's players had dipped their toes into equities, high yield bonds and hedge funds over the past five years, a lead he expected others to follow.

Hedge funds are more widely held still, despite their relative lack of liquidity, a problem Mr Osborne sees being addressed by the new generation of Ucits hedge funds with a minimum of fortnightly liquidity. "That brings hedge funds more into the liquidity bracket that managing agents want."

Mr Osborne reports some agents have ventured into property funds in the past six months. However, emerging market debt remains unpopular - many syndicates write political insurance risk, which is closely correlated to the sovereign risk embedded in this asset class.

Luke Savage, finance director of Lloyd's, which manages the central fund, says just 2 per cent of agents' assets are invested in equities, compared to equity exposure of 10-15 per cent for continental European insurers. "We feel very comfortable having slightly less sparkling performance in return for not putting our members at risk," he says.

## Pensions

At the end of one's working life, retirement beckons, but how is life financed after retirement? For most people, the answer is some type of pension. While many countries do provide a basic state pension, this usually needs topping up by means of a supplementary pension to give a reasonable quality of life.

There are many types of pension available, but usually the person wishing to have a pension in the future has to begin the process of putting money aside to fund it. This money is put into an organisation which invests it to provide the pensions when required. The total amount invested in these type of schemes is huge. IFSL estimates that global pension assets totalled \$31.1 trillion at the end of 2010. Figures for 2009 give a total amount for pension assets of \$28.8 trillion. The UK's share of the market is 2.5 trillion, the second largest after the US, whose 63 per cent share dominates the market – see Exhibit 4.14.

In the future, pensions look like being a major problem for many governments. Populations in general are aging as a result of improved health care, disease control and healthier lifestyles. According to figures produced by the United Nations (UN) the percentage of people aged over 65 compared with the working population (aged 15-64) is set to rise considerably – see Exhibit 4.15. Without action, this is going to cause great difficulties for governments. Many countries are raising the retirement age, with an equivalent delay in pension provision to try to reduce the burden.

# Unfunded schemes

In the UK, 3 million workers (such as teachers and civil servants) are members of public unfunded pension schemes. These are termed pay-as-you-go (PAYG) schemes where the money put aside each month by employees and employers pays the pensions of current pensioners. This means that there is not a pot of accumulated money to pay pensions. If there is a shortfall, it is

Already, there is about £1,000 billion in unfunded future pension payments for UK public-sector workers. Looking around the world we see that the majority of state-funded pensions so far have been PAYG schemes, but many countries are in the process of reforming their pension provisions as these schemes have begun to prove unsustainable with the increasing age of the population and its growing dependency on the state.

# Funded schemes

Funded pension schemes are designed so that the insured, and their employers, make regular payments to a pension fund, which will (hopefully) grow and provide future pension income. Many companies and other organisations such as universities already run such schemes for their staff. In the UK, 6 million employees are currently paying into a workplace pension scheme. However, that still leaves 14 million salaried employees not saving into a workplace scheme, and the UK government is keen to ensure that a much higher proportion of employees is part of a funded scheme. Thus, under the Pension Act 2008, UK employers, if they do not currently run a funded pension scheme, will be expected to put the equivalent of a minimum of 1-3 per cent of the employee's salary into a new national pensions savings scheme – known as Nest, the National Employment Savings Trust. The employee will be automatically enrolled, but can opt out and is required to contribute 1-4 per cent of salary, while an additional 1 per cent comes from the government in the form of tax relief. Nest is designed as a low-cost scheme so that even very small companies can contribute to it without having to establish their own schemes.

Increasing longevity and the sharp fall in return on pension fund assets over the past 20 years (especially returns from equities) have caused pension deficits in a considerable number of companies providing a kind of funded pension called defined benefit pensions – see below.

Companies in the FTSE 100 (the largest companies on the London Stock Exchange) had deficits totalling £41 billion in 2008; this rose to nearly £90 billion in 2009.

The deficit arises when the actual amount of assets expected to be in the pension pot at retirement (with added investment income) is not sufficient to pay out the pensions required.

# Defined benefit

A defined benefit (DB) pension pays out a fixed amount based upon the number of years worked and the level of final salary or the average level of salary. So, for example, you might be a member of a final salary one-eightieth scheme, which means that the number of years you have been making contributions to the fund is multiplied by  $\frac{1}{80}$  and the result is multiplied by your final year's salary (or some average over a number of years). So if you have worked and contributed for 40 years and your final salary is  $\pm 30,000$  you will, under a final salary scheme, be entitled to  $\frac{40}{80} \times \pm 30,000 = \pm 15,000$  per year in retirement, and may receive three times that as a lump sum on retiring. Despite the scheme being set up as a separate organisation, the sponsoring employer usually remains responsible for final provision of the pension. To reduce their risk they usually insist on significant contributions from the employee during their working life – 7.5 per cent of salary in the case of members of the Universities Superannuation Scheme, with employing universities putting in another 16 per cent of salary each month.

With pension schemes which were set up to provide pensions before our modern increasing longevity, companies are finding that DB pensions are becoming too costly, especially in combination with recent economic recessions which have caused such an alarming decrease in some pension fund assets that their DB pension schemes are in deficit, i.e. the fund is worth less than the present value of promised benefits. According to an IFSL (TheCityUK) report, 'Pension fund markets 2010', companies in the FTSE100 reported substantial increases in their final salary pension scheme deficits in their end-March accounts, with the aggregate deficit in the region of £96 billion. Some companies (e.g. BT, BBC, Network Rail, IBM, Barclays and BP, among many) are attempting to reduce their DB liabilities by closing the scheme to new employees, taking out insurance (very expensive), transferring them to a different scheme, or offering employees financial incentives to change to another scheme.

Some pension funds are looking for ways to alleviate their predicament (see Exhibit 4.16) by offloading their pension liabilities to third parties such as insurance companies, but this can be costly.

# Paul J Davies

Cadbury's deal yesterday to offload  $500\mathrm{m}$  of pension fund liabilities to Edmund Truell's Pension Insurance Corp was just the latest in a string of agreements as public and corporate pension schemes tackle their  $\S 1,000\mathrm{bn -plus}$  headache.

Trustees across the country are being offered an array of solutions to the expense and volatility of their pension obligations after the recent financial market turmoil added impetus to companies' desire to reduce the risks attached to their schemes.

If the past decade was about the closure of defined benefit pension schemes and the move to defined contribution, the next 10 years are expected to see an ever-greater focus on reducing investment and longevity risks.

JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, Cerberus from private equity, and Swiss Re, Pacific Life Re and Partner Re, have all been moving aggressively into a field that was previously dominated by old-fashioned bulk-annuity deals from Prudential and Legal & General.

What these companies are offering is a troika of options: buy-outs, where a financial company takes over an entire scheme; buy-ins, where a chunk of investment and longevity risks within a scheme are insured by a third-party; and longevity swaps, where a derivative contract takes away only the risk that pensioners live and draw an income much longer than expected. (See box)

Longevity swaps have been the most popular recently, with almost 10bn (£6bn) of deals completed

# Pension scheme options

# - Bulk Annuity

The traditional policy offered by large UK insurers. Pension schemes pay a premium and in exchange the insurer writes an annuity that pays the retirement income of a large chunk of a scheme's pensioners who have already retired. Trustees offload all investment, inflation and longevity risks associated with paying income to a group of retirees, insurer gains chunk of assets and a premium

# Buy-outs

A specialist insurer takes over an entire pension scheme. This can only be done for fully funded schemes. The idea grew out of the business of managing the pension schemes of bankrupt companies, but has been applied more to companies still going. Trustees get a replacement sponsor and manager of an entire scheme. Insurer gains all the assets

# Buy-ins

Similar to bulk annuity, Pension schemes purchase an insurance contract that underwrites the risks associated with paying income since early 2008, mainly by life assurance companies looking to reduce the risks on their own annuity books.

But this summer saw Goldman Sachs complete two such deals directly for corporate schemes at RSA and Babcock.

The popularity of these deals has been driven by affordability at a time when the other options have been too expensive, due to higher premiums to cover the investment risk and lower valuations put on assets that would leave a scheme as part of the deal.

The last big buy-in before the market turmoil was undertaken by Prudential for Cable and Wireless and closed just days ahead of Lehman Brothers' collapse in September 2008.

to retirees. But these have also been used of offload the liabilities associated with so-called deferred pensioners, usually people who have left a company but have not yet retired. The way to make money here is to offer individuals a cash settlement today in exchange for future pension rights. Trustees offload all investment, inflation and longevity risks associated with paying income to a group of retirees. Insurer gains control over a chunk of assets and a premium

# - Longevity swaps

The pure trade. Pension schemes keep assets and so retain investment and inflation risks. The swap counterparty is usually an investment bank, which then lays off most, if not all, of the risk to a reinsurer or into the capital markets. Trustees pay a fixed regular premium to offload the risks that they will have to keep paying out pensions to retirees for longer than planned for. Investment bank and reinsurer pay a floating premium in return, which increases the longer people live

However, in recent months markets have recovered enough for buy-ins to become more affordable again.

On top of the Cadbury deal with PIC, Goldman Sachs in November completed a  $\S 370\mathrm{m}$  buy-in for CDC, the government-owned business that invests in development projects.

In September, Lucida, the Cerberus-backed business run by Jonathan Bloomer, the former Prudential chief executive, completed a  $500\mathrm{m}$  buy-in for the Merchant Navy Officers pension fund.

For large insurance groups and for some of the new entrants such as Lucida, the focus is on building up a large pool of assets to manage, which generate profits from the difference between the investment returns and the money paid out to pensioners.

# Defined contribution

The defined contribution (DC) type of pension is increasingly prevalent. This is a pension where the contributions (from employee and employer) are fixed but the actual pension paid out is linked to the return on the assets of the pension fund and the rate at which the final pension fund is annuitised; at retirement age, an annuity is generally purchased with the accumulated funds to provide the pension. As returns on accumulating money and annuity rates fluctuate with economic and financial volatility, it is entirely possible for the pension to be less (or more) than expected. There is no obligation for the employer to guarantee a level of pension under DC. If the fund underperforms while the employee is still working and saving in the scheme, or administrative costs rise, there will simply be a lower pension. In other words, the risk of poorly performing investments is transferred to the prospective pensioners.

# Personal/private pensions

Personal or private pensions are not provided by the state. They put the onus of funding a pension solely on the recipient, who pays a regular amount, usually every month, or a lump sum to the pension provider who will invest it on their behalf. These funds are usually run by financial organisations such as insurance companies, building societies or banks. Personal pensions are often the optimal choice for people wishing to organise their own pension, those who are self-employed or whose company does not provide a suitable pension.

Personal pensions are a very tax-efficient way of providing for the long-term future in the UK:

- The contributions qualify for full tax relief. This means that if, say, £2,880 is contributed from taxed earnings, the government then adds back tax (at 20 per cent) to the fund, amounting to £720, meaning that £3,600 is added to your pension pot. Higher-rate taxpayers are able to get additional tax relief.
- Once the money is in the fund it can grow without tax being levied on interest income, or on capital gains. (However, dividend income is taxed.)
- At retirement age 25 per cent of the fund may be taken in cash, tax free.

A pension may be taken while still in employment. There is a wide range of funds, each specialising in a different type of investment – UK or overseas shares, passive/tracker funds or actively managed, corporate bonds and gilts and cash.

A stakeholder pension (SHP) is a contract-based pension introduced in 2001 by the UK government. It places limits on charges and allows individuals flexibility around contributions. SHPs are available for an individual to take out on their own, or through an employer in a group scheme (Group SHP). Tax relief rules allow tax to be claimed back on contributions, even for non-taxpayers.

### Self-invested personal pension (SIPPs)

Self invested personal pensions are pension plans that allow the contributor to control the type and amount of investments made and have the same tax advantages as personal pension schemes. SIPPs were originally aimed at people with large pension funds (over £200,000) but are now available to anyone with a contribution of £3,600 or more per year. People with multiple pension schemes can bring them all under one SIPP wrapper, resulting in easier management. The downside of SIPPs is that there are likely to be more charges than for a standard personal pension: a set-up fee followed by fixed annual fees, plus charges for each deal. Online SIPP providers can offer a more cost-effective way of managing the plan.

SIPP plans can invest in a wide variety of investments: domestic or international shares, gilts, corporate bonds, unit trusts, OEICs, investment trusts, insurance company funds, exchange-traded derivatives, gold bullion, loans and deposit accounts or even commercial property.

### Public pensions

Nearly all countries in the developed world provide some sort of state-funded i.e. public pension for their people. Sometimes these pensions are means-tested (people's incomes and assets are examined to ensure they are poor enough to qualify) and the state will top up the income of the really poor if the pension is insufficient. These pensions are funded by public money, taxes and revenues, and as we have already said, are becoming an increasing burden on government finances. Governments around the world are encouraging people to contribute to private or personal pensions, thus relieving them of an onerous responsibility.

In the UK, a non-earnings-related pension is paid by the state, based on the National Insurance contributions a person has put in over the course of their working life. This is a PAYG scheme, in that the current working generation's payments into the scheme funds current pensioners' income. The UK government, in line with other countries, has plans to increase the pension age to 66 (women 65) in the near future, with a further increase to 70 under discussion, as a way of lowering the amount that has to be raised in taxes to pay these pensions.

### Pension fund trustees, consultants and managers

Pension funds create large pools of assets and the task of the funds' controllers is to manage the assets well and generate sufficient income to pay out pension liabilities. The growth in the size of these funds has been quite remarkable and now the amount of assets at their disposal is enormous (more than 30 trillion in 2010), so the managers in charge of the funds are in an incredibly influential position. Indeed, pension funds are now the largest category of investor: they invest in both domestic and international financial markets and can have huge influence on countries' wealth, development and industries.

Because this large 'float' (pension contributions paid in but not yet paid out in pensions) is available, there have been various scandals in the past, where pension fund cash has been used for other purposes (e.g. the Mirror pension fund plundered by Robert Maxwell, who was able to persuade the trustees of the Mirror fund to lend to or invest in other companies controlled by Maxwell, which then failed), or the company has gone bankrupt and thereby left the pensioners with nothing, or the money has been badly invested, leaving insufficient in the pot to pay out pensions. In many cases, if a pension fund collapses, the employee has no redress, unless fraud or other criminal activity can be proved.

Avoiding misappropriation of the money in pension funds is therefore one of the most important tasks for trustees, who control the fund and hire managers to invest the money. Trustees are required to know and understand the various laws relating to pensions and trusts, their funding and the investment of their assets. Their overall objective is to set up their fund as a secure source of funds for retirement benefits and oversee its management.

Consultants are asked to give their professional advice to trustees on the type and amount of investments to be made. They have access to a plethora of historic data from which they can advise on, for instance, the best investment path to take and which investment managers are likely to outperform the stock market. They may also help with the calculations for figuring out the amount needed to be put into the fund each year, taking into account a number of estimates: the estimated return on assets, projected future wage growth (for DB schemes) and future inflation (if the pensions are index-linked, that is rise as inflation goes up).

Managers are tasked with investing and ensuring that the fund returns are satisfactory, but they can sometimes be too cautious or too rash, with disastrous results for the pensioners. As pension funds increased in size, it became apparent that in most cases a single manager could not cope with the volume of investment. This started a trend towards decentralisation – employing multiple managers, each specialising in a particular asset class of investing. Some funds are run only by one or a number of in-house investment fund managers working directly for the fund; others outsource their investment manager functions – this is where the consultants can help in selection. Still others have a mixture, with some of the money managed in-house and some by professional fund managers. See Exhibit 4.17 for a discussion on this ('Alpha' is outperformance in the market after adjusting for increased risk).

#### 20-year study finds pension funds rational

David Blake

Decentralised investment management is widespread throughout the institutional investment industry and, in particular, the pension fund industry.

Yet, despite the huge economic importance of this practice, very little is known about the economic motivation for decentralising or about how fund performance and risk-taking behaviour are affected by it.

We, at the Pensions Institute, used a proprietary dataset to make a study into decentralisation in investment management in the UK pension fund industry from 1984 to 2004. Over this period, most pension fund sponsors shifted: a) from employing a single balanced manager, who invested across all asset classes, to specialist managers, who specialise mostly within a single asset class, and

b) from a single manager (either balanced or specialist) to competing multiple managers (balanced, specialist, multi-asset or combinations thereof) within each asset class.

This shift from single balanced managers to multiple specialist managers carries significant decentralisation costs.

Decentralisation involves suboptimal risk-taking at the portfolio level, due to the problem of co-ordinating different managers through incentive contracts. The hiring of multiple managers also increases total fund management fees. We examined whether these shifts have been rational; that is, whether fund sponsors have experienced increased performance to compensate for the suboptimal diversification.

We found that specialist managers did generate superior performance, particularly in respect of stock selection or alpha. By contrast, balanced fund managers failed to display any significant stock-selection or market-timing skills, either in the form of strategic or tactical asset allocation skills. There was also evidence of persistence in performance over time by specialists, especially in UK equities.

We then examined the effects on performance and risk-taking from employing multiple managers. We found mild evidence to support the conjectures that competition between multiple managers produces better performance - but this held only in the case of competing specialist managers in UK equities - and that pension fund sponsors react to the co-ordination problem by controlling risk levels: total pension fund risk (and, in particular, alpha risk) is lower under decentralised investment management.

We found that the switches from balanced to specialist mandates and from single to multiple managers were preceded by poor performance. In the latter case, part of the poor performance was due to the fund becoming too large for a single manager to manage: sponsors properly anticipated diseconomies of scale as funds grew larger and added managers with different strategies before performance deteriorated significantly.

We also studied changes in risk-taking when moving to decentralised management. Here, we found that sponsors appeared to rationally anticipate the difficulty of co-ordinating multiple managers by allocating reduced risk budgets to each manager, which helped to compensate for the suboptimal diversification that results from decentralisation.

Overall, our findings help to explain both the shift from balanced to specialist managers over the sample period - pension funds benefited from superior performance as a result of the shift - and the shift from single to multiple managers - pension funds benefited from risk reduction and from avoiding fund-level diseconomies of scale by employing multiple managers. We interpret these shifts as being rational by pension fund sponsors, despite the greater co-ordination problems and diversification loss.

Finally, we note that, following the end of our sample period in 2004, further specialisation of skills in pension fund management has occurred. For example, there has been the emergence of diversified growth funds which offer investments in such "alternatives" as private equity, hedge funds, commodities, infrastructure, currencies and emerging market debt.

### Pension fund asset holdings

Pension funds are major purchasers of long-term investments which suit their liabilities well; they need to be able to generate sufficient to be in a position to pay out pension liabilities decades in the future. Until the recent financial crisis, many pension funds held a large proportion of their funds in equities. Since then, equities have been reduced in favour of long-term bonds and fixed-rate instruments, which are thought to give a more secure return (see Exhibit 4.18). The important factor is to look at the long-term future stability of the fund and invest where this can be best guaranteed.

Percentage of the total fund allocated to each

Following the financial crisis of 2008, BTPS policy has been to move out of higher-risk UK equities (down to 10 per cent from 29 per cent in 2005) and into 'safer' fixed-rate securities, such as government bonds. It is interesting to see the increase in investment in hedge funds, which were once regarded as highly speculative. Pension funds are trying to recoup their losses through higher-performing investments (see Exhibit 4.20).

Sam Jones and Kate Burgess

The number of pension schemes looking to invest money with hedge funds doubled during 2009, according to a leading investment consultancies. Hewitt Associates has seen inquiries from clients to increase sharply as pension fund trustees scrabble to find high-performing investment strategies to help recoup losses suffered in 2008.

"A lot of institutional investors have got over the emotional block that hedge funds are risky products that they should be scared of. Clients are much more comfortable with the asset class," Guy Saintfiet, a senior hedge fund researcher at Hewitt told the Financial Times.

Other consultants - which play a crucial role as intermediaries in guiding pension funds' investments - also report a change in attitudes towards hedge funds. According to Damien Loveday, a senior investment consultant at Towers Watson, pension fund trustees had become more sophisticated. Most UK schemes were now looking to allocate up to 15 per cent of their portfolio to hedge funds, Mr Loveday said.

Pension fund managers are also looking to make allocations directly to hedge fund managers. In the past, institutional investors have preferred exposure via a fund of funds, which pools money and makes diversified investments.

Several of the largest pension funds have already indicated that they are looking to make significant direct allocations to hedge fund managers. The  $\S 28\mathrm{bn}$  University Superannuation Scheme - the UK's second largest pension plan - said last Tuesday it expected to invest with as many as 30 managers during the next two years. Its investments will add up to  $\S 1.4\mathrm{bn}$ .

In the US, CalPERS, the world's largest pension scheme, said in its end-of-year statement that it had conducted due diligence on 66 hedge funds. Like many of its peers, it has yet to make any investment.

Source: Financial Times, 1 February 2010, p. 4. Reprinted with permission.

BTPS is administered by a board of 11 trustee directors who are jointly responsible for the administration of the scheme. Many of the investment decisions are taken by in-house managers, but a large proportion of the money is placed with outside managers who charge a fee (say, 0.5 per cent of funds under management per year) to invest, e.g. Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM), M&G Asset Management and Blackrock. The managers are answerable to the trustees.

BTPS had a deficit of  $\pounds 7.598$  million at the end of 2009 and BT, the operating company, was planning to pay additional contributions into the scheme over the next few years to reduce the deficit. The fact that it has a deficit already is going to be compounded by the way in which the number of pension recipients has grown much larger than the number of contributing members still in work – see Exhibit 4.21. The drawbacks of a DB scheme that did not collect enough from its workers or the company in decades gone by are clearly shown, as it is simply not possible for current contributions to satisfy historic liabilities, hence the deficit, exacerbated by the financial recession. Many other companies' DB pension funds are in a similar position to BTPS.

BTPS has adjusted its investments to try to improve the asset return. Exhibit 4.22 shows the 14 largest investments held directly by the scheme at the end of 2009 expressed as a percentage of the total investment assets of the scheme.

### Regulations

In the UK, the Pensions Regulator is empowered by the government to regulate work-based pension schemes and has wide-ranging powers to enforce its decisions. Its aim is to protect members' benefits and encourage high standards in running pension schemes. It has powers to compel companies to inject additional money into their pension schemes and to remove trustees should a conflict of interest get in the way of them acting solely for the pension fund members. The regulator also tries to limit the claims made by failed schemes on the Pension Protection Fund (see below). Exhibit 4.23 describes some of the cases the regulator has dealt with.

In the US, the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) are responsible for overseeing retirement (pension) plans and have established minimum standards for them.

# Regulator takes aim as recession hits pensions

Norma Cohen

Britain's Pensions Regulator will appear tomorrow in a courtroom in Canada, defending its efforts to lay claim to a portion of the assets of Nortel, the telecoms equipment manufacturer that sought protection from creditors last year.

Nortel's UK pension scheme had a shortfall of roughly  $\S 1.2\mathrm{bn}$  and the regulator hopes its claim will help fill the gap.

Such an appearance is unusual for the regulator, which has traditionally kept a low profile.

But in recent months that has changed as the recession, and the resulting increase in deficits, has pushed its caseload up and forced its work into the open as it takes on FTSE 100 stalwarts and multinationals.

The action against Nortel comes just one week after Readers Digest Association announced it would place its UK subsidiary into administration because the regulator failed to grant it immunity from claims for a  $125\mathrm{m}$  shortfall in its scheme that would only be partly filled through a corporate restructuring.

The regulator has also been at loggerheads with trustees and executives at BT and British Airways, sponsors of two of the UK's largest schemes, over how they calculate the size of their liabilities. The calculation could have a significant impact on how much cash each employer needs to add to its retirement plan every year.

The moves are at odds with the public stance the regulator has taken in the near five-year period since it opened its doors, in which it presents itself as a facilitator in resolving disputes rather than a participant in them.

David Norgrove, chairman, has said the body's role is to be "a referee, not a judge".

Moreover, he has said that the regulator prefers to threaten to use its powers - such as compelling companies to stump up cash for their scheme or removing trustees whose conflicts of interest are too deep - rather than actually use them. The Pensions Act forbids it from disclosing disputes with companies until formal proceedings begin, leaving much of its work a mystery to the specialists who advise companies and trustees.

But as the financial crisis has deepened and corporate finances have become more strained, the regulator appears to be using its powers more frequently. Indeed, by its own count, it exercised its powers almost as much in the six months to September 30 as in the full year to last March.

Pensions advisers note that the regulator's role is twofold. First, it must protect benefits promised to workers. It does this by ensuring that companies fund their shortfalls over reasonable time frames, with weaker companies urged to fill deficits rapidly.

Second, it must try to limit claims on the Pension Protection Fund, the employer-financed insurance scheme for under-funded plans of insolvent companies.

In light of that dual responsibility, the regulator is taking a tougher line when companies are at higher risk of insolvency.

John Ralfe, an independent pensions adviser, said that few of its efforts are transparent, by law.

Mr Ralfe argues that the regulator could shed more light on its stance by making decisions public, say, a year or two after the dispute occurred. That way, advisers would know more about where the limits are.

But Bob Scott, partner at actuarial consultants Lane Clark & Peacock, said making such decisions public might encourage companies to fund to the minimum they thought the regulator would allow. "Every time the regulator sets a standard, everyone gravitates towards it," he said.

Gary Squires, head of pensions at Zolfo Cooper, a corporate advisory service, said that some of what appears to be a tougher stance is simply the regulator learning about actions that may have been "close to the wind" when they were set a few years earlier but that were not disclosed.

He noted that some employers undertook corporate restructuring that may harm the scheme without asking the regulator's view. "There are companies that find it easier to say 'sorry' than to say 'please'." The regulator is simply trying to make amends.

In 2003, the EU issued a Pension Funds Directive with the aim of ensuring a high level of protection for members and beneficiaries of pension funds, and also allowing and encouraging cross-border management of pension schemes. This last aim has found difficulties because of the divergence in each country's fiscal laws and regulations.

In the past, pension funds have been subject to plenty in the way of guidelines and advice, but little in the way of compulsory regulation. However, over the past decade various organisations and governments around the world have introduced regulations aimed at avoiding the recurrence of pensions fund failures and providing compensation if these failures happen.

Some experts think that pension schemes should be subject to the same stringent rules about solvency that will be applied by the EU to insurance companies by 2012, but that does not solve the problem of present deficits.

### Pension protection schemes

In the UK, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) was established in 2005 to compensate members of DB funds should their company fail and be liquidated, leaving insufficient assets in the pension scheme to cover its pension liabilities. If the scheme has to or will have to pay out more than the contributions put in, then the scheme can be in deficit and be unable to meet its pension liabilities. The PPF pays out up to 90 per cent of what has been promised, up to a maximum of £29,897.42 a year. The cash to finance the PPF comes from a levy imposed on all eligible pension funds.

DC scheme members lose out if fraud or theft occurs and may then be eligible for compensation from the PPF, but they cannot claim compensation for shortfalls in the fund. Their contributions are invested with the hope that they will provide an adequate pension, so although the eventual pension will vary according to the ability (and luck!) of the pension fund managers, their individual fund cannot be in deficit other than through fraud or theft.

### Institutional Shareholder Committee

The Institutional Shareholder Committee, founded in 1991, sets out the principles of behaviour for institutional shareholders (such as managers of pension and insurance funds, investment trusts, etc.). It also set standards of behaviour it expects from corporations in which its members hold shares and other securities. The members of the committee are the Association of British Insurers (the trade association for the 300 or so British Insurance Companies), the Association of Investment Companies (the trade association for the closed-ended investment company industry – see later in the chapter), the Investment Management Association (representing the UK investment management industry) and the National Association of Pension Funds (representing the interests of occupational pension schemes).

In the case of pension funds, it advises that institutional shareholders' primary duty is to the beneficiaries of a pension scheme. It regularly updates its code and encourages managers to behave more like owners and to take an intelligent interest in their investments. If fund managers think that companies such as BP or Shell are not being run properly, they have a duty to intervene rather than sitting quietly and watching as a crisis happens, a duty particularly relevant after the financial recession and company failures of 2008-2009.

The four trade associations listed above keep an eye on corporate management and make recommendations on how institutional investors should vote on issues such as the size of directors' pay. These tend to be widely supported by institutions and often result in the target company changing its decision.

## Collective investment

The idea of collective investment (pooled funds) has been around since about 1800. Its concept is simple: money from a group of people is gathered together and put into a range of investments. This reduces the risk of total loss for all contributors by enabling them to invest in a far wider range of investments than they could individually.

Worldwide, collective investments are responsible for vast amounts of funds (see Exhibit 4.24). According to the Investment Company Institute, the total worldwide assets amount to an astonishing 23 trillion administered by 65,735 funds. About half of these assets and funds are in the US. The UK has more than 2,000 funds responsible for £449,500 million.

Collective investment offers some significant advantages to the investor.

- First, a more diverse portfolio can be created. Investors with a relatively small sum to invest, say £3,000, would find it difficult to obtain a broad spread of investments without incurring high transaction costs. If, however, 10,000 people each put £3,000 into a fund there would be £30 million available to invest in a wide range of securities. A large fund like this can buy in large quantities, say £100,000 at a time, thus reducing dealing and administrative costs per pound invested.
- Second, even very small investors can take part in the stock markets and other financial markets. It is possible to gain exposure to the equity, bond or other markets by collective investing for a small amount, e.g. £30 per month.
- Third, professional management removes the demanding tasks of analysing and selecting shares and other securities, going into the marketplace to buy, collecting dividends, etc., by handing over the whole process to professional fund managers.
- Finally, investment can be made into exotic and far-flung markets, South American companies, US hi-tech, Chinese technology, etc. without the risk and the complexities of buying shares direct. Collective funds run by managers familiar with the relevant country or sector can be a good alternative to going it alone.

These advantages are considerable, but they can often be outweighed by the disadvantages of pooled funds, which include high fund-management costs and possible underperformance compared with the market index. Also, collective investors lose any rights that accompany direct share investment, including the right to attend the company's AGM or receive shareholder perks, and lose the fun of selecting their own shares with the attendant emotional highs and lows, triumphs and lessons in humility.

### Open-ended investment vehicles

OEIVs are a type of collective fund that does not have restrictions on the amount of shares (or 'units') the fund will issue. If demand is high enough, the fund will continue to issue shares no matter how many investors there are; the size of the fund is dictated by the amount of investment in it. The value of each share is dictated by the net asset value (NAV) divided by the number of existing shares. The NAV is defined as the total value of assets at current market value less any liabilities. Open-ended funds must buy back shares when investors wish to sell. The most common types of OEIVs are unit trusts, open-ended investment companies (OEICs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.

#### Unit trusts

Unit trusts are issued in Australia, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore and the UK, and sold in units not shares. The first to be issued was in 1931 by M&G. According to the Investment Management Association (IMA), in January 2011 there were 737 funds in the UK managing £220.8 billion – see Exhibit 4.25 for the ten largest fund managers. They are administered by a trustee (usually a bank or insurance company rather than a single person) who is the legal owner of the trust's assets and runs the trust on behalf of its investors, appointing managers and making sure that the trust is run responsibly. In the UK, they are subject to Financial Services Authority (Financial Conduct Authority) regulations, which dictate to some extent the proportion of holdings allowed.

Exhibit 4.25 The managed assets of the ten largest fund providers in the UK

<table><tr><td></td><td>£ billion</td></tr><tr><td>1 Fidelity Investments</td><td>22.40</td></tr><tr><td>2 Threadneedle Investments</td><td>12.53</td></tr><tr><td>3 Scottish Widows Unit Trusts Managers</td><td>11.98</td></tr><tr><td>4 Invesco Perpetual</td><td>11.70</td></tr><tr><td>5 Legal &amp; General Unit Trust Managers Ltd</td><td>10.89</td></tr><tr><td>6 M&amp;G Group</td><td>9.29</td></tr><tr><td>7 Schroder Investments Ltd</td><td>9.25</td></tr><tr><td>8 Halifax Investment Fund Managers Ltd</td><td>8.44</td></tr><tr><td>9 Gartmore Investment Management Plc</td><td>6.61</td></tr><tr><td>10 SLTM</td><td>6.00</td></tr></table>

The value of the units is determined by the market valuation of the securities owned by the fund. So if, for example, the fund collected together £1 million from hundreds of small investors and issued 1 million units in return, each unit would be worth £1. If the fund managers over the next year invest the pooled fund in shares which increase in value to £1.5 million the value of each unit rises to £1.50.

Unit holders sell units back to the managers of the unit trust if they want to liquidate their holding (turn it into cash). The manager would then either sell the units to other investors or, if that is not possible because of low demand, sell some of the underlying investments to raise cash to redeem the units. Thus, the number of units can change daily, or at least every few days. There is no secondary market trading in unit trusts as all transactions are carried out through the trust managers.

##### Pricing

The pricing of unit trusts is divided into two parts, the bid price and the offer price. The offer price, the price a new investor has to pay, is calculated by valuing the investments underlying the fund once a day using a method prescribed by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The bid price, the price a seller receives, is usually set 5-6 per cent below the offer price (for funds invested in shares). The difference between the bid and offer prices is called the spread and pays for two things: first, fund administration, management of the investments, marketing, as well as commission for selling the units; second, the market makers' spreads and brokers' commissions payable by the fund when it buys and sells shares.

Most unit trusts are now priced on a forward basis, which means that the price paid by a buyer of units will be fixed at a future time (often 12 noon) so a buyer may not know the exact price at the time that they send a buy order. Some funds still charge the historic price, taking the value from the last valuation.[12]

Quite a high proportion of the initial charge in the bid-offer spread (maybe 4-5 per cent) is commission payable to financial advisers, who recommend investment to individuals. Fund supermarkets $^{13}$  frequently give a discount on the initial charge. Thus, we have the slightly odd situation where going directly to the fund manager to buy units will result in being charged the full initial fee, whereas buying through an agent may cost 4-5 per cent less. $^{14}$

##### Charges

There are three charges:

1 Initial charge ('sales' or 'front-end' charge). This is included in the spread between the bid and offer prices. So if the fund has a spread of 6 per cent, it might allocate 5 per cent as an initial charge. Some unit trusts have dropped initial charges to zero – particularly those investing in interest-bearing securities (bonds, etc.) and tracker funds (those that do not try to spot shares that will outperform the market, but merely invest in a broad range representative of a stock market index – also called passive funds).

2 Annual charges. The annual management fee is typically 1-1.8 per cent. A further charge of about 0.2 per cent covers legal, custody, audit and other administration costs. Over time the annual fees have a larger effect in reducing the value of the investment than the initial charge. Typically, about one-third of the annual fee is paid to the financial adviser who recommended the fund.

3 Exit charges. Some funds make an exit charge instead of an initial charge if the units are sold within, say, the first five years.

##### Reading the Financial Times

The Financial Times publishes unit trust bid and offer prices every day. An example is shown in Exhibit 4.26. The list for Schroders displays both unit trusts and OEICs (discussed below). OEICs have a single price.

##### Buying and selling units

Units can be bought direct from the unit trust management company by filling out an application form. Alternatively, they can be bought through a financial adviser, discount broker or fund supermarket. Because of the uncertainty about the exact purchase price, it is possible to set a limit on the price when buying. When it comes to selling all or some units, they can be sold back to the management company, which is obliged to purchase. Payment will be made within five days.

##### Who looks after the unit holders' interests?

There are four levels of protection for the unit holder:

- The trustee These organisations, usually banks or insurance companies, keep an eye on the fund managers to make sure they abide by the terms of the trust deed – for example, sticking to the stated investment objectives, e.g. investing in Japanese shares. Importantly, the trustee holds all the assets of the fund in their name on the unit holder's behalf, so if anything untoward happens to the fund manager the funds are safeguarded. The trustee also oversees the unit price calculation and ensures that the FSA/FCA regulations are obeyed.
- The FSA (FCA) Only funds authorised by the FSA/FCA are allowed to advertise in the UK. Unauthorised unit trusts, most of which are established offshore (outside the jurisdiction of the FSA/FCA), are available, but they may carry more risk by virtue of their unregulated status.
- The ombudsman Complaints that have not been satisfactorily settled by the management company can be referred to the Financial Ombudsman – see Chapter 15.
- The Financial Services Compensation Scheme Up to £50,000 is available for a valid claim – for example, when an FSA/FCA-authorised fund becomes insolvent or suffers from poor investment management (see Chapter 15 for more on this).

##### Types of trust available

Unit trusts in the UK offer a wide range of investment choice. UK All Companies funds invest at least 80 per cent of their assets in UK shares. Some funds focus investment in shares paying high dividends (UK Equity Income), others split the funds between equity and bonds (UK Equity and Bond Income), while some invest mostly in government bonds or corporate bonds. Some place the bulk of their money in smaller companies, some in Far East shares. A few trusts invest in commercial property. The possibilities are endless – see www.investmentuk.org for a definition of dozens of classes of funds.

##### Returns

The return on a unit trust consists of two elements: first, income is gained on the underlying investments in the form of interest or dividends; second, the prices of the securities held could rise over time. Some unit trusts pay out all income, after deducting management charges, etc., on set dates (usually twice a year) in cash. Accumulation units reinvest the income on behalf of the unit holders and as a result the price of accumulation units tends to rise more rapidly than income units. The Financial Times shows listings for prices of income ('Inc') units (also called distribution units) and accumulation ('Acc') units.

##### Minimum investment

Some trusts ask for an initial minimum investment of only  $250$  or so, whereas others insist on at least  $\pounds 1,500$ . Thereafter, under a savings plan, it may be possible to put in as little as  $\pounds 25$ . It is often possible to use shares instead of cash as payment for units through a share exchange scheme.

##### Following the units' progress

A manager's report will be sent every six months detailing the performance of the fund over the half year, the events in the market(s) in which the fund invests, and explaining the manager's investment strategy. It will also comment on future prospects, list the securities held by the fund and display the fund's financial accounts. At least once a year a statement is sent showing the number of units held and the latest prices.

The most obvious place to track units is in newspapers such as the Financial Times. Money Management magazine tracks fund performance over periods of one, two, three, and five years. Many websites, such as fund supermarket websites, carry details of units, e.g. www.citywire.co.uk.

#### Open-ended investment company

OEICs (pronounced 'oiks') have been around since May 1997 and were introduced as a more flexible and simpler alternative to existing unit trusts. Many unit trusts have turned themselves into OEICs. An OEIC is a company which can be listed on the stock exchange and it issues shares whereas a trust issues units. It is an open-ended diversified collective investment vehicle. OEICs are regulated in a similar way to unit trusts, so investor protection is much the same. Investment in OEICs may be made on a regular basis, or as a lump sum. Exhibit 4.27 shows the largest OEIC management companies and the total amount invested in their different OEICs.

OEICs have an authorised corporate director (ACD) managing the fund and a depository (usually a large bank) supervising activities to safeguard their assets. The ACD's remit is to invest shareholders' funds in accordance with the fund's objectives. In January 2011, there were 1,672 OEICs in the UK.

Compared with unit trusts, OEICs have a simpler pricing system because there is one price for both buyers and sellers. Charges and dealing commissions are shown separately, which makes them more transparent than unit trusts. Some OEICs charge an exit fee. When OEICs are bought or sold, the share price is the value of all the underlying investments (NAV) divided by the number of shares in issue. The price is not based on the supply and demand for its shares (as with investment trusts – see later) and is calculated daily, usually at 12 noon in London.

As an open-ended instrument the fund gets bigger and more shares are created as more people invest. The fund shrinks and shares are cancelled as people withdraw their money.

The OEIC may be a stand-alone fund or may have an 'umbrella' structure, which means that it contains a number of sub-funds, each with a different investment objective, e.g. income or growth. Sub-funds may focus on differing equities, US shares, UK shares, etc. Each sub-fund could have different investors and asset pools. Similarly to unit trusts, OEICs offer income or accumulation shares; income shares offer regular income to investors as the OEIC collects dividends, etc. from investments, while accumulation shares reinvest the income into more shares, so the shareholding increases.

#### Exchange-traded funds

First introduced in the US in 1990, exchange-traded funds take the idea of tracking a stock market index or sector a stage further. ETFs are set up as companies issuing shares and the money raised is used to buy a range of securities, such as a collection of shares in a particular stock market index or sector, say the FTSE 100 or pharmaceutical shares. Thus, if BP comprises 8 per cent of the total value of the FTSE 100 and the ETF has £100 million to invest, it will buy £8 million of BP shares; if Whitbread is 0.15 per cent of the FTSE 100, the ETF buys £150,000 of Whitbread shares. (Alternatively, many ETFs do not buy the actual shares but gain exposure to the share returns by the purchase of derivatives of the shares.)

They are open-ended funds – the ETF shares are created and cancelled as demand rises or falls. However, they differ from unit trusts and OEICs in that the pricing of ETF shares is left up to the marketplace. ETFs are quoted companies and you can buy and sell their shares at prices subject to change throughout the day (unlike unit trusts and OEICs, where prices are set by a formula once a day). Globally, there are over 2,700 different ETFs listed on more than 40 exchanges with a total value over 1,400 billion. In the US alone over 800 ETFs are traded on the stock markets. They have become so significant there that around 30 per cent of New York Stock Exchange trading is in ETFs.

Despite an ETF's price being set by trading in the stock market they tend to trade at, or near to, the underlying net asset value – the value of the shares in the FTSE 100, for instance. This is different from investment trusts, which frequently trade significantly below net asset value.

With traditional ETFs, newly created ETF shares ('creation units') are delivered to market makers $^{16}$  ('authorised participants') in exchange for an entire portfolio of shares matching the index (not for cash). The underlying shares are held by the fund manager, while the new ETF shares are traded by the market maker in the secondary market. To redeem ETF shares the ETF manager delivers underlying shares to the market maker in exchange for ETF shares. ETF managers create new ETF shares only for market makers with at least £1 million to invest, so private investors are excluded at this level. However, private investors can trade in existing ETF shares in the secondary market.

If the price of an ETF share rises above the value of the underlying shares, there will be an arbitrage opportunity for the market maker. Arbitrage means the possibility of simultaneously buying and selling the same or similar securities in two markets and making a risk-free gain, for example buying bananas for £1 in one market and selling them for £1.05 (after costs) in another. In this case the ETF share representing, say, the top 100 UK shares is trading above the price of the 100 shares when sold separately. Market makers, spotting this opportunity, will swap the underlying basket of shares for a creation unit of ETF shares, thus realising a profit by then selling the ETF shares into the market. Then the new supply of ETF shares will satisfy the excess demand and ETF prices should fall until they are in line with the underlying NAV.

If the ETF share price falls below the underlying shares' value the market maker will exploit this by having the ETF share redeemed by the ETF manager. The market maker ends up with the more valuable underlying shares and the supply of ETFs in the marketplace has fallen, bringing the price back up to the NAV. The advantage arising from market makers and ETF managers not handing over cash, but instead swapping ETF shares and underlying shares, is that there are no brokerage costs for buying and selling shares. This makes transactions cheap.

Spreads – the difference between market makers' buying and selling prices of ETFs – are generally around 0.05–0.3 per cent (although spreads can widen to 10 per cent or more at times of extreme volatility, for example after 11 September 2001). While there is no initial charge with ETFs, annual management charges range between 0.2 per cent and 0.75 per cent but are typically between 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent (these are deducted from dividends). All in all, ETFs are a cheaper way of benefiting from a rising market than unit or investment trusts.

Private investors can purchase ETFs from brokers. Their minimum charge is between £10 and £40 per trade and no stamp duty is payable on purchase (in the UK a stamp duty tax is payable when investors buy shares and other securities). Prices are shown in the Managed Funds section in the Financial Times – see Exhibit 4.28. The Financial Times shows ETFs that track the US market (e.g. MSCI USA index), European shares (e.g. DJEurSTX 50), the UK market (e.g. FTSE 100) and dozens of other markets, from Japanese shares to government bonds. ETFs pay dividends in line with the underlying constituent shares or other income such as interest on bonds, quarterly or semi-annually. This is reflected in the yield (yld) column. Useful websites for ETF investors are iShares (www.ishares.com) and Trustnet (www.trustnet.com/etf).

We have moved a long way from the simple traditional equity ETFs of the 1990s. Nowadays the ETF manager may not purchase all the shares in the index but merely a sample. This is useful for

ETFs invested in, say, Chinese or Vietnamese shares where government restrictions may prevent purchasing all the shares in an index. The exchange-traded concept has been extended beyond equities and bonds to foreign exchange rates, commodities and commodity indices (exchange-traded commodities, ETCs). Instead of the provider holding the underlying instrument or commodity, the investment is in swaps or other derivative instruments. The problem with derivative-based ETFs is that there is a risk that the counterparties providing the derivatives may not be able to meet their obligations and then the ETF holder may not have anything tangible backing up the ETF shares. Also, if the ETF provider does not buy the underlying securities but instead relies on derivatives and then goes bust, it could be more complicated for an investor to retrieve their investment.

Derivatives are now used for a lot of share index ETFs – 'synthetic replication' of an index. There is a debate going on in the ETF world as to whether ETFs consisting solely of derivatives are truly ETFs at all. But, regardless of some misgivings, it looks as though volume of synthetic ETFs will overtake that of traditional physical ETFs – see Exhibit 4.29.

# ETFs 'risk causing confusion'

Europe's exchange traded funds industry risks creating "confusion, disappointment and disillusion" among investors, according to Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research at BlackRock, who said the sector had reached "an important crossroads" after a decade of rapid growth.

Warning that "products which are not even funds are being called ETFs", Ms Fuhr said the industry was at risk of moving away from the traditional virtues of transparency and ease of understanding that had attracted retail and institutional investors.

With ETF assets in Europe forecast to increase by 30 per cent this year, BlackRock said it expected more hedge fund managers to create ETFs by using their own funds as the underlying exposure.

"Hedge funds are noticing the growth and appeal of ETFs which are simple and easy to understand but have powerful distribution networks," said Ms Fuhr.

Although ETFs could provide wider access to hedge funds as an asset class, Ms Fuhr cautioned that these new products would also be more challenging for investors to understand.

As developers work to include hedge funds, structured products and active funds within ETF wrappers, BlackRock argued this had led to the emergence of funds that did not provide transparency on their underlying portfolios, did not have real time estimates for their net asset value and did not offer daily creation and redemption of their underlying units.

The comments come as the industry this month marks the 10th anniversary of the first ETF launch in Europe, the iShares DJ Stoxx 50, which was listed on the Deutsche Börse.

As of January, assets under management across Europe's ETF industry had risen to 217.9bn across 896 funds, although retail investors only account for 10 to 15 per cent of this market, compared to 40 to 50 per cent in the US.

The emergence of swap-based ETFs since 2005 has been one of the most important developments for European investors, when the advent of Ucits III regulations allowed for wider use of derivatives.

BlackRock estimated there were 515 swap-based ETFs with assets of  \$101.9bn at the end of 2009, compared to 314 physically based ETFs with\$ 125bn of assets.

The first ever ETF, the Toronto 35 Index Participation Fund, was created in March 1990. "Today, there is a growing fan club who cite ETFs as one of the greatest financial innovations of the past two decades," said Ms Fuhr.

#### Mutual funds

Sometimes the term mutual fund is used as a generic term for collective or pooled investments. However, in the US and Canada the term has the specific meaning in terms of their organisation and legal structure.

Mutual funds began in the US in Boston in 1924 and have become the major part of the US investment market. Around half the households in the US have shares in mutual funds, with over 7,600 mutual funds managing assets totalling over 10.7 trillion in 2010. They are administered by a group of directors appointed by the shareholders, who rely on them to run the fund correctly. The vast majority are open-ended funds, but there are some that are closed-ended.

Investors depend on the expertise of managers to invest and make a profit. Funds fall into three general categories of investment: capital growth, stability of capital or current income. Within these categories is a huge variety of sub-categories, with varying amounts of risk, and investors must choose the type of investment and level of risk. Investors can choose to receive dividends or have them reinvested in the fund.

Mutual funds must comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and various other federal rules and regulations, and are monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 1940 Act was devised to prevent the unscrupulous, reckless and sometimes fraudulent activities which had been quite common due to the lack of any regulations in the capricious times following their introduction. The Boston funds emerged unscathed through these turbulent times and were a model for future funds.

Securities belonging to the fund must be placed with a custodian (usually one of the major banks) for safekeeping. The value of each mutual share is dependent on the NAV, which in the US is calculated daily at 4pm New York time.

Mutual shares are sold to investors, and the manager of the fund, called the portfolio manager, buys investments according to the objective of the fund as set out in the prospectus. As with unit trusts and OEICs, investors can put in a relatively small amount of money and be part of a professionally managed and diversified portfolio.

There are various types of funds, including stock (equity) funds, bond funds, sector funds, money market funds and balanced funds (investing in a mixture of asset types).

#### Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS)

For anyone wishing to invest in funds outside their own country, problems occurred because there were no common regulations governing investment funds, and it was difficult, if not impossible, to have any degree of trust in foreign investment companies. There was also a lack of a safety net (e.g. compensation scheme from the industry or government) if the fund turned out to be fraudulently or incompetently run. To counter these problems, the 1985 UCITS directive established 'Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities', introducing EU-wide rules governing collective investments which could be sold across the EU subject to local tax and marketing laws. So an investor could, with confidence, invest in French, German, Spanish, etc. funds, safe in the knowledge that the funds were subject to statutory regulations.

A subsequent directive in 2002 broadened the range of assets that harmonised funds can invest in and introduced new rules for the supervision of UCITS and a required simplified prospectus, to which firms may add extra information if they wish. The simplified prospectus is designed to be used as a universal marketing tool for UCITS throughout the EU, providing clear information about charges, costs and fund performance that can be easily understood by an average investor.

UCITS III further increased the flexibility of cross-border funds. They can now do many of the things that hedge funds can do, such as use derivatives. The types of funds that choose to go down this route are called Newcits.

Any eligible collective fund (e.g. UK unit trusts or OEICs, but not investment trusts) may apply for UCITS status, enabling them to market their fund throughout the EU.

### Closed-ended investment vehicles

These are collective investment vehicles that do not create or redeem shares on a daily basis in response to increases and decreases in demand (in contrast to OEIVs, unit trusts and OEICs, etc.). They are publicly traded companies that have raised their capital through an initial public offering (IPO) and have a fixed number of shares for lengthy periods, as with any other company that issues shares. They are actively managed and often concentrate on a particular sector or industry. The value of their shares fluctuates according to market forces.

#### Investment trusts (investment companies)

Investment trusts were first launched in London in 1868 to invest in foreign government bonds or fixed-interest stocks. Investment trusts (companies) place the money they raise in assets such as shares, government bonds, corporate bonds and property. Unlike unit trusts, they are set up as companies (they are not trusts at all!) and are subject to company law.[17] If you wish to place your money with an investment trust you do so by buying its shares. Investment trusts are floated on the London Stock Exchange where there is an active secondary market.

An investment trust has a constitution that specifies that its purpose is to invest in specific types of assets. It cannot deviate from this. So it may have been set up to invest in Korean large company shares, US biotechnology shares or whatever, and it is forbidden from switching to a different category of investment. This reassures the investor that money placed with a particular trust to invest in, say, UK large companies won't end up in, say, Russian oil shares. Of course, if you want to take the risk (and possible reward) of investing in Russian oil shares you can probably find an investment trust that specialises in these – there are, after all, over 400 investment trusts quoted in London, with total assets of £80 billion, to choose from.

As a company an investment trust will have a board of directors answerable to shareholders for the trust's actions and performance. With investment trusts being closed-end funds, the amount of money under the directors' control is fixed, which enables them to plan ahead with confidence, unconcerned that tomorrow investors may want to withdraw money from the fund. Investors cannot oblige the trust to buy the shares should they want to sell (in contrast to unit trusts and OEICs). They have to sell to another investor at a price determined by the forces of supply and demand in the secondary market. Purchases and sales are made through stockbrokers in the same way as for any other company share.

The selection of investments for the trust and the general management of the fund may be undertaken by an in-house team of investment managers who are employees of the trust (a 'self-managed' trust) or the investment management task may be handed over to external managers. Most are externally managed. More than 100 investment companies are venture capital trusts (VCTs), which are given tax breaks by the UK government to encourage investment in small businesses not listed on a stock market – see Chapter 14.

##### Discounts and premiums

The biggest factor influencing the share price of an investment trust is the value of the underlying assets owned by the trust. This is expressed as a net asset value per share. In theory, the trust's share price should be pretty close to the value of the assets held, but in practice they frequently sell at a large discount to NAV – only a few sell at a premium to NAV. Discounts of 10–20 per cent are not uncommon; they have even reached 68 per cent. The main factor that drags the price below NAV is the lack of demand for the shares. Here is a typical scenario.

In year  $\times$  there is great interest in, say, eastern European smaller companies so an investment trust is set up and offers its shares (say, 50m) for sale at  $£1$  each. With the money raised,  $£50$  million of eastern European company shares are bought by the trust. For the next year the underlying assets (all those shares in Polish companies, etc.) do no more than maintain their value of  $£1$  per investment trust share and so NAV is constant. Nothing in the fundamentals changes, but the enthusiasm for investing in these up-and-coming nations grows among the UK investing public. Investment trust shareholders who want to sell find that they can do so in the LSE secondary market at above NAV. New buyers are willing to pay  $£1.08$  per share – an 8 per cent premium to the NAV.

However, in the following year a worldwide recession strikes and investors head for safe havens; they pile into bonds and familiar shares at home. The NAV of the trust's shares falls to 60p as prices plummet on the eastern European stock exchanges. What is worse for the investment trust shareholders is that sentiment has become so pessimistic about eastern European companies that they can sell their shares for only 50p. They trade at a discount of 16.67 per cent to NAV (10p/60p).

Discounts may seem to present an excellent opportunity – you can buy assets worth 60p for 50p – but they can be bad for the investor if the discount increases during the time you hold the shares. As you can see from the last column in Exhibit 4.30, the discounts can be much larger than the example above. The Financial Times publishes the share prices and NAVs of investment trusts (companies) daily.

While much of the discount on a typical investment trust is due to negative sentiment, there are some rational reasons for shares selling below NAV:

- Investors may think trust managers are incompetent and likely to lose more value in the future.
- NAV is calculated after deducting the nominal (stated book) value of the debt and preference shares. In reality, the trust may have to pay back more on the debt and preference shares than this.
- Liquidating the fund incurs costs (e.g. contract cancellations, advisers' fees, stockbrokers' fees) so NAV is not achieved.

##### Costs

When buying (or selling) investment trust shares, commission will be payable to the stockbroker $^{19}$  as usual when buying shares (usually £20–40 for purchases of a few thousand pounds). The trust managers' costs for managing the investments and for administration are charged to the fund, either against annual income or against capital. A typical total expense ratio (TER), including the costs of investment management and administration, directors' fees, audit fees and share registration expenses, is between 1.5 per cent and 1.8 per cent of the fund value (but this excludes performance fees that managers often take). Some voices are saying that investment trusts are not being organised for the benefit of investors as much as they should be – see Exhibit 4.31.

##### Borrowing

Investment trusts have the freedom to borrow (unlike unit trusts or OEICs). Borrowing to buy assets is fine if the return on assets over time exceeds the interest charged. However, it is a double-edged sword. The risk associated with gearing up returns becomes all too apparent when asset values fall. Take the case of our trust investing in eastern Europe. If it had sold 50 million shares at £1 each and also borrowed £50 million to buy £100 million of eastern European shares, the NAV would still start at £1 per share (£100 million of assets minus £50 million debt owed, for 50 million shares). If underlying asset values fall by 40 per cent because of the fall in the Warsaw Stock

# Exhibit 4.31

# Trust boards accused over independence

Boards of investment trusts have been accused of failing to act in the interests of their shareholders, amid complaints that some are "in the pockets" of fund managers.

Analysts say many investment companies are too small and illiquid for investors to get out, while fund managers are rarely fired for poor performance. Trusts also come under fire for failing to buy back shares regularly.

Some point the finger at those on the boards of investment trusts, who they accuse of being more

# Exhibit 4.31 continued keen to hold on to their jobs than do what is best for the company. Sitting on an investment trust board may require one day's work a month but can pay more than 20,000 a year - and many board members sit on multiple boards.

"Do turkeys vote for Christmas? That is part of the problem," admits one board member.

Others think board members feel too much loyalty to fund managers. Some fund managers are instrumental in appointing board members and can also brand the investment company with their name, which one board member says "can sway boards" against firing managers.

"Legally the board employs the fund manager but in reality the fund manager employs the board," says Nick Sketch, private client manager at Rensburg Sheppards.

While directors are legally required to avoid a conflict of self interest, a report from Frostrow Capital says some boards do not clearly demonstrate how potential conflicts are dealt with when a manager is also on the board.

Some board members make an active effort to be proactive, however. Hamish Buchan, who chairs two boards and is a member of four others, says chairmen of boards should contact big shareholders and give them the opportunity to have private meetings with the board once a year.

The Association of Investment Companies also says that putting too much pressure on boards to remove poorly performing fund managers could result in a dismissal at the wrong time.

There are many other options open to boards to improve floundering investment trusts: implementing regular share buy-back schemes to control the discount, requesting a new fund manager from the same fund management house or simply communicating better with shareholders.

Others think the best thing boards can do is encourage their brokers do get more people interested in a sector that is facing increasing competition from cheaper tracker funds and open-ended fund managers' marketing clout.

Investment trusts have suffered in recent years from the departure of large buyers such as pension funds. The Bank of England pension scheme used to be many brokers' best client but has since sold its holdings.

"The investment trust sector needs to go out and find new clients," says Paul Locke, analyst at Canaccord.

Exchange, the net asset value per share falls dramatically from 1 to 20p - an 80 per cent fall - because the assets fall to 60 million, but the debt remains at 50 million:

```txt
Value of eastern European shares £60m Less debt -50m 10m
```

Net asset value per share: $\frac{\text{£10m}}{50\text{m}} = 20\text{p}$

You can see why trusts that borrow a lot can be very volatile.

#### Sovereign wealth funds

Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are collective funds set up and managed by governments. Thus, a country that has a large flow of income, due to say oil, may establish a fund on behalf of its people so that they can gain a future income from the investment fund after the oil has gone. Given that they now control $3,000–$4,000 billion of investments around the world, their decisions on where to place money can have a significant effect on finance and economics. They used to be buy-and-hold-type investors looking for long-term returns. However, following the financial crisis, many were used as sources of finance to support their domestic economies; this kind of political interference may grow. Exhibit 4.32 describes a number of SWFs.

### Custodians

Custodians are guardians or safe-keepers of securities. The term often refers to custodian banks, whose legal remit is to look after the various assets of investment companies, especially pension funds (and mutual funds in the US), in return for a fee. They safeguard the securities or other assets which the funds own, check on and distribute dividend payments, capital gains and general information relating to the diverse range of assets. One of HSBC's custodianship tasks is to safeguard gold bullion bars (worth £33 billion in 2010) backing a gold investment fund.

#### Wealth of nations

FT

### Abu Dhabi

Outside estimates put the value of the opaque Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's biggest sovereign fund, at upwards of \$600bn. The portfolio includes quoted equities, fixed income, property, infrastructure and private equity, with global equities the biggest category. The aim is to secure the welfare of the emirate and provide stabilisation funding when necessary. Adia does not seek active management or control. About 60 per cent of the portfolio is in index-replicating assets. It is suing Citigroup over losses on its \$7.5bn purchase of shares in the bank in 2007.

### Norway

The aim of the Government Pension Fund Global is to manage national petroleum wealth and to meet rising public pension liabilities; while also preventing the "Dutch disease" - whereby windfall revenues lead to an overvalued exchange rate that distorts the domestic economy - taking hold. The $510bn fund is split 60/40 between foreign equities and bonds. It takes contrarian views, recently buying Greek government bonds; and ethical views, excluding from the portfolio in August two Israeli companies involved in developing Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territory.

### Russia

In 2008 the Oil Stabilisation Fund, managing state-controlled energy groups' revenues, was split to recognise its different functions: one managing official reserves; the other, which became the National Welfare Fund SWF, making higher risk investments. The purpose of this SWF is to smooth fluctuations in energy revenues and to fund pensions. But during the financial crisis, when foreign capital fled the country, it sold foreign investments to plug the budget deficit, support the mortgage market and prop up domestic share prices. It is reportedly worth just under $40bn.

### China

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) manages China's foreign exchange reserves and acts as its sovereign wealth fund. It is reportedly worth just under $40bn.

### Singapore

Temasek – the smaller of the country's two SWFs, with $144bn under management – is one of the rare funds in the sector that aims to engage with the boards and managements of the companies in which it invests. Of its portfolio, 32 per cent is invested in Singapore, with 46 per cent in the rest of Asia (excluding Japan). It attracted headlines by incurring big losses on the sale of holdings in Bank of America and Barclays but has fully recouped the ground lost in 2008-09. It boasts a total shareholder return of 17 per cent a year since it was set up in 1974.

They provide a very necessary protection for investors against any illegal or fraudulent activities of any fund manager, who could be tempted into dishonest behaviour simply by the enormity of the sums involved. The idea is to keep the assets at arm's length from the individuals running the fund.

In the UK, HM Revenue and Customs keeps a list of approved custodians. Domestic custodians look after domestic assets; global custodians oversee assets held in the rest of the world.

### Concluding comments

Imagine life without insurance. Would you dare to drive a car? What if you had an accident and were required to replace someone else's car? Or worse, you injured someone so badly that you had to pay out £1 million in compensation? Surely the absence of car insurance alone would cause a reduction in economic output and in the quality of life because we would rarely take the risk of driving. The same logic applies to shipping goods around the world or constructing a building. Ship owners, airlines and builders cannot take the risks of hurting someone, or the risk of a fire or of loss of property from theft or accident, and so would generally refuse to take part in productive activity. We would all be poorer as a result. So clearly, even though the white-collar workers in the insurance industry do not produce a tangible thing that you can see and touch, they do help the rest of society go about pleasurable and business activity.

Imagine a world without pension funds. How fearful would you be as you grew older, not knowing where your income was going to come from? Saving under the mattress is one way to reduce the fear. But wouldn't it be far better to save into a fund that invested that money in industries around the world or in government bonds, producing a nice steady accumulation of wealth? Wouldn't it be better to have the discipline of being a member of a scheme that every month deducts contributions from your salary – that you would barely notice – and places it at arm's length from you, under professional management, and you were forbidden to touch it until you were ready to retire? And even after retirement, you could take only a portion of it each year – imposing another discipline to avoid you over-optimistically spending, or investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Clearly, pension managers, trustees and consultants provide an important service and we would miss them if they were not there.

Imagine a world without collective investment funds. If you wanted to invest in shares you would have to do so as an individual. Not only would the costs be high if you have only a small amount of savings, but the need for expertise would put off many people from even starting the process. As a result companies needing capital to grow would have fewer potential investors and would have to pay higher rates of return on the funds that were provided, reducing their willingness to go ahead with that new factory or develop that new computer program. A world without collective investment would be one with far fewer investment asset choices available to savers – most people would not be any more adventurous than sticking their money in a bank account. At the end of the day they would be poorer and society would be poorer because less risk capital would be employed to create new firms and industries. Clearly, collective investment vehicles under professional management help mobilise savings for productive investment, helping the savers to build their nest-eggs and helping companies to grow.

### Key points and concepts

Insurance - in return for a premium, risk is assumed by the insurer.

Insurance companies can be either normal companies or mutual firms owned by policy holders.

Underwriters use historical statistics to assess risks and set terms and cost of premiums.

- Asymmetric information is when one party in a negotiation or relationship is not in the same position as the other parties, being ignorant of, or unable to observe, some information which is essential to the contracting and decision-making process.
- Adverse selection occurs when there is an opportunity or incentive for some firms/individuals to act to take advantage of their informational edge over others. Then the firm/individual doing that activity will be disproportionately those taking advantage rather than being truly representative of the population as a whole, e.g. the tendency for poorer-than-average risks to continue with insurance.
- Moral hazard recognises the danger that someone who is insured may be more likely to take risks and be less careful because they are insured.
Insurance is sold in the following ways: direct from insurer; through agent; through broker; through bank, building society, solicitor, travel agent, mail-order agent or accountant.
Life/long-term insurance covers risk of loss of life.
- Term assurance pays out on death within a set time.
- Whole of life is guaranteed to pay out when the insured dies as long as the premiums are up to date.
- Endowment policies pay out at a set future date or on earlier death of the insured.
- Annuities provide regular income until death of the insured.
Insurance companies may also run pension schemes.
- General/non-life insurance covers risks other than death.
- Property insurance covers all types of property. Open policies cover everything not specifically excluded; named peril policies cover named risks.
Casualty insurance covers accidental damage.
Liability insurance covers third-party damage.
- Premiums go into a float used to make investments.
- General insurance companies need a high proportion of liquid investments whereas life insurance companies can invest a higher proportion in longer-term investments.
- Reinsurance is when an insurance company insures insurers: proportional reinsurance pays out a proportion of a claim; non-proportional covers losses over a specified amount.
Retrocession: the purchase of reinsurance by reinsurance companies.
- Spiralling is unknowingly reinsuring own risk.
- Protection and Indemnity (P & I) Clubs offer protection and indemnity in respect of third-party liabilities and expenses arising from owning or operating ships.
The International Underwriting Association is the world's largest organisation for international and wholesale insurance and reinsurance companies.
Lloyd's is not an insurance company, it is a society of members – that is, a group of members trading in insurance via brokers, in an environment run by the Corporation of Lloyd's, which is overseen by the Council of Lloyd's. Lloyd's is a meeting place where insurance customers, brokers and underwriters meet face to face and discuss requirements and strike insurance underwriting deals. It concentrates on property and casualty insurance and the underwriters are famed for their ability and willingness to undertake unusual risks. For a long time, it was made up of individuals, Names, who underwrote particular risks with unlimited liability and joined together in syndicates to underwrite. Now it is dominated by corporate underwriters who still underwrite through syndicates. Syndicates run for one year.
- Public unfunded pension schemes (pay-as-you-go (PAYG)) is where the money put aside each month by employees and employers pay the pensions of current pensioners. This means that there is not a pot of accumulated money to pay pensions. If there is a shortfall, it is met by the Treasury.
Funded pension funds are designed so that the members, and/or their employers, make regular payments to a pension fund, which will (hopefully) grow and provide future pension income.

A pension deficit arises when the actual amount of assets expected to be in the pension pot at retirement (with added investment income) is not sufficient to pay out the pensions required.

A defined benefit (DB) pension pays out a fixed amount based upon the number of years worked and the level of final salary or the average level of salary.

A defined contribution (DC) is a pension where the contributions (from employee and employer) are fixed but the actual pension paid out is linked to the return on the assets of the pension fund and the rate at which the final pension fund is annuitised; at retirement age, an annuity is generally purchased with the accumulated funds to provide the pension.

- Personal or private pensions are not provided by the state. They put the onus of funding a pension solely on the recipient, who pays a regular amount, usually every month, or a lump sum to the pension provider who will invest it on their behalf.
Self-invested personal pensions are pension plans that allow the contributor to control the type and amount of investments made.
- Pension funds are run by trustees (who control the fund and hire managers to invest the money), consultants (who are asked to give their professional advice on the type and amount of investment to be made to trustees) and managers (tasked with investing and ensuring that the fund returns are satisfactory).
- Pension schemes are major investors in long-term assets, e.g. shares and bonds.
In the UK, the Pensions Regulator is empowered by the government to regulate work-based pension schemes and has wide-ranging powers to enforce its decisions.
In the UK, the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) was established to compensate members of DB pension funds should their company fail leaving insufficient assets in the pension scheme to cover its pension liabilities. Pension protection schemes compensate for failure of DB schemes, or fraud and theft in DC schemes.
- The Institutional Shareholder Committee sets out the principles of behaviour for institutional shareholders. It also set standards of behaviour it expects from corporations in which its members hold shares and other securities. The members of the committee are the Association of British Insurers (the trade association for the 300 or so British insurance companies), the Association of Investment Companies (the trade association for the closed-ended investment company industry), the Investment Management Association (representing the UK investment management industry) and the National Association of Pension Funds (representing the interests of occupational pension schemes).
- Collective investment is pools of money gathered together for investment purposes. Advantages – more diversity in investments; small investors can participate; professional management; investment possible in atypical areas. Disadvantages – poor management leading to poor performance; costs of management; loss of shareholders' perks.
- Open-ended investment vehicles (OEIVs) – no restriction on size of fund; shares/units issued or redeemed according to demand.
- Unit trusts are investment funds administered as trusts issuing units.
- Unit trust's trustee is the legal owner of assets.
Value of trust determined by market valuation of underlying securities.
- Unit trusts have two prices: offer (buying) price and bid (selling) price. The difference between them is the spread.
- Unit trust prices can be forward or historic.
Charges - initial, annual and exit.
- Four levels of protection for unit holder: trustee; financial regulator; ombudsman; Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
- Accumulation units reinvest income within the fund; income units pay out a high regular dividend to unit holders.

Active management - manager actively researches and chooses investments.

Passive management - manager tracks market index.

- Open-ended investment company (OEIC) - similar to unit trust but formed as a company issuing shares.
OEIC size varies according to number of shares and is valued by market value of assets.
OEICs run by authorised corporate directors with depositary safeguarding assets.
OEICs have single pricing scheme with charges added.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are set up as companies issuing shares and the money raised is used to buy a range of securities such as a collection of shares in a particular stock market index or sector.
- Pricing of ETFs is dictated by market; prices change constantly.
Management charges are much lower than for mutual funds, unit trusts and investment trusts.
- Sometimes the term mutual funds is used as a generic term for collective or pooled investments. However, in the US and Canada the term has the specific meaning in terms of their organisation and legal structure. The vast majority are open-ended funds, but there are some that are closed-ended funds.
- Mutual funds are run by shareholder appointed directors. The manager of the fund, called the portfolio manager, buys investments according to the objective of the fund as set out in the prospectus. Assets are placed with a custodian and funds are valued daily.
- Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) - EU-wide rules governing collective investments which could be sold across the EU subject to local tax and marketing laws, so an investor could, with confidence, invest in French, German, Spanish, etc. funds, safe in the knowledge that the funds were subject to regulation.
- Closed-ended investment vehicles – publicly traded companies with a set number of shares. They place the money they raise by selling shares in assets such as shares, government bonds, corporate bonds and property.
- Investment trusts are set up as companies. They have a constitution specifying the type of investment.
- Investment trusts are run by directors responsible to shareholders.
- Trusts' share prices frequently sell at a large discount to net asset value on the secondary market.
- Investment trusts have the freedom to borrow (unlike unit trusts or OEICs).
Sovereign wealth funds are collective funds set up and managed by governments.
- Custodians are guardians or safe-keepers of securities. Custodians give protection to investors against fraud and dishonesty.
