# Money markets

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

The money markets allow vital connections between those institutions with money to lend for short periods and those needing to borrow. There is not just one market but a wide range, each with its own modes of operating and jargon. By the end of this chapter the reader should: have a sound grasp of the usefulness of money markets to the well-being of people around the world;

be able to describe the functions of money and the components of the rate of return; describe the key benchmark interest rates, such as LIBOR, used by financial markets and corporations;

explain the operation and social value of the following money markets: interbank

Eurocurrency

Treasury bills

■ commercial paper repurchase agreements

local authority issues certificates of deposit

■ bills of exchange and banker's acceptances; calculate interest rates on various money market instruments, including conversion to annual rates. Also calculate the price of some money market securities;

■ discuss the role of credit rating agencies and the meaning of different ratings, e.g. AAA or A-1+; show an understanding of the money markets table in the Financial Times and on various websites.

Just as people need to keep control of their finances, making sure that if they do spend more than their income they have a way of tapping into sources of funds by borrowing for short periods (e.g. credit cards or overdraft), so governments, corporations and other organisations have similar requirements. There are times when these organisations are in need of funds for merely a day, a week or the next three months. They thus need a place where they can borrow to make up the shortfall. The money markets fulfil this role. Banks are an alternative source of short-term finance, but in many cases the money markets are cheaper and involve less hassle.

There are other times when organisations have surplus funds and instead of keeping that money as cash or in current accounts at banks, earning little or no interest, they choose to lend it out to other organisations needing short-term funds by purchasing money market instruments from them.

While we, as individuals, borrow to make up shortfalls or lend surpluses (e.g. by putting money in our bank accounts) in tens, hundreds and maybe thousands of pounds or euros, governments and companies borrow or lend in millions of pounds or euros. Thus the money markets are termed a 'wholesale market' rather than a 'retail market'.

In sum the money markets are wholesale financial markets in which lending and borrowing on a short-term basis takes place – that is, usually for less than one year.

# Interest often comes from discount pricing

In a literal sense money is not actually traded in these markets, financial instruments are. When manufacturing firms, financial institutions, governments, etc. find themselves in need of short-term funds, they sell an instrument which carries the promise to pay, say, £10 million in 30 days from now. For many of the money market instruments the purchaser of that promise will not pay as much as £10 million because they want to receive an effective interest rate for lending. So they might pay, say, £9.9 million. Thus the security is sold for less than face value. The discount is the difference between face value and purchase price. The yield, the rate of interest gained by the holder, occurs when the instrument reaches maturity and the face value is paid by the issuer to the holder. Note that while most money market securities are issued at a discount, this is not true of all of them. Certificates of deposit and interbank deposits, for example, are issued at their face value and then redeemed at a higher value.

With many of the money market instruments the original purchaser is able to sell the instrument on to another investor before maturity if they want to raise some cash themselves – i.e. there is a secondary market. Thus these securities are said to be negotiable. So, staying with the example, say after 20 days the original lender could sell this promise to pay £10 million in a further 10 days for £9.96 million. Thus a profit can be made by trading the instruments on the secondary market before they reach the redemption date – in this case £60,000.

However, it must be noted that a loss may be incurred by selling in the secondary market. If, say, the original lender can attract buyers only at a price of £9.87 million then it makes a £30,000 loss. This low price may occur if, for instance interest rates on similar financial instruments with ten days to maturity are now yielding a higher rate of return because lenders have become more wary and demand higher rates of return to compensate for higher risk – a lot can change in the financial markets in 20 days. The potential secondary market purchaser would be silly to pay a price higher (receive a lower yield) than the going market rate for this particular issue when there are better deals to be had – i.e. the potential buyer has an opportunity cost (the return on the best alternative use of their investment money) and so the best the original lender can get is £9.87 million, if it has to sell. If it can avoid selling for another ten days then it will receive the full £10 million from the borrower.

The secondary markets in money market instruments are generally very liquid; that is, those organisations lending temporary surpluses to borrowers by buying money market securities are able to get at their capital (turn it into cash) quickly without the risk of reducing the price significantly, and there are low transaction costs in releasing the cash.

The discount and rate of interest (yield) earned is dependent on the risk level and the maturity of the instrument. The 'maturity' is the length of time between issue of the instrument (start of borrowing) and the time it is redeemed (money due is paid), or the length of time between when a security is priced or purchased in the secondary market and the date of redemption. The maturity length can vary from overnight (borrowing for just 24 hours) to three months to one year (or more, occasionally). Interest is measured in percentage points, which are further divided into basis points (bps). One basis point equals  $1/100$  of a percentage point.

# Example Commercial paper

Commercial paper is a very popular way of raising money for large, well-regarded companies. For example, a corporation wishes to borrow  \$100 million for two months. It issues commercial paper with a face value of\$ 101 million, payable in 60 days' time. A purchaser is prepared to accept the promise of the company to pay out in 60 days and so buys some of the commercial paper, paying  \$25 million for one-quarter of the total issue at a discount to the face value. In 60 days' time, the purchaser collects\$ 25.25 million from the corporation. It has earned  \$250,000 in return for lending the corporation\$ 25 million.

# The markets in short-term money

Money markets exist all over the world as a means of facilitating business. Domestic money market means that the funds are borrowed and lent in the country's home currency and under the authority of the country's regulators. There are also money markets outside the jurisdiction of authorities of the currency they are denominated in – these are the international or Euro money markets. This is nothing to do with the currency in Europe: they were termed 'Euro markets' long before the euro was dreamed up.

Money markets are used by a wide variety of organisations, from treasury departments of corporations to banks and finance companies (e.g. raising large sums in the money markets to then provide hundreds of loans to people wanting to buy cars on hire-purchase deals). Pension funds and insurance companies maintain a proportion of their investment funds (they lend on the money markets) in liquid, low-risk form to meet unpredictable cash outflows, e.g. following a hurricane. These markets are also used by central banks to influence interest rates charged throughout the economy; for example, changing base rates at banks, which has a great effect on mortgage rates or business loan rates.

In the modern era, rather than having one or a few market locations or buildings in which money market instruments are bought and sold, we have organisations arranging deals over the telephone and then completing them electronically. The process of bringing together buyers and sellers is assisted by the many brokers and dealers who tend to operate from the trading rooms of the big banks and specialist trading houses – they regularly trade money market securities in lots worth tens of millions of pounds, dollars, etc. Some of them act as market makers, maintaining an inventory of securities and advertising prices at which they will sell and, slightly lower, prices at which they will buy. By providing these middle-man services they assist the players in the market to quickly find a counterparty willing to trade, thus enhancing liquidity. They are said to be traders in STIR products, that is short-term interest rate products.

Some of the trades are simply private deals with legal obligations to be enforced by each side, but some are conducted through a central clearing house, with each party responsible for reporting the deal to the clearing house, which settles the deal by debiting the account of the buyer and crediting the account of the seller. The clearing house then holds the security on behalf of the buyer. The risk of a counterparty reneging on the deal (counterparty risk) is reduced by trading through a clearing house.

# Case study 5.1 Vodafone

You can get some idea of the importance of money markets to companies from the table below showing figures taken from Vodafone's annual reports. Vodafone keeps a large amount of cash and cash equivalents in reserve: more than £4 billion in 2010. Cash equivalents are not quite cash but they are so liquid that they are near-cash (near-money or quasi-money). They are financial assets that can easily be sold to raise cash, or which are due to pay back their capital value in a few days, with low risk regarding the amount of cash they will release. These are mostly money market instruments.

Vodafone keeps this large quantity of money available in this highly liquid and low-risk form so that it can supply its various business units with the cash they need for day-to-day operations or for regular investment projects. Also, it is useful to have readily accessible money to be able to take advantage of investment opportunities as they appear fleetingly (e.g. the purchase of a company). Alternatively, the cash and near cash is there because the company has recently had a major inflow – perhaps it sold a division or has had bumper profits – and it has not yet allocated the money to its final uses, such as paying billions in dividends to shareholders, launching a new product, buying another company or simply paying a tax bill. In the meantime that money may as well be earning Vodafone some interest, so the money that is surplus to the immediate needs of the various business units of Vodafone is gathered together and temporarily lent to other organisations in the money markets.

We will examine the nature of money market funds, repurchase agreements and commercial paper, among a number of other money market instruments, later in the chapter.

# Money market funds

Despite the wholesale nature of the money markets it is possible for private individuals with funds available for lending in thousands of pounds/euros/dollars rather than hundreds of thousands to participate in money market transactions. They can do so via special funds set up to invest in money market instruments by pooling the savings of many people. These money market funds are administered by financial institutions which benefit from economies of scale in investing in a portfolio of money market securities. Savers buy 'shares' in the money market fund. They earn a return, technically a dividend but in effect an interest rate.

Corporations may also deposit money in money market funds to obtain good rates of interest through professional management of the fund. They also value being able to withdraw money from the fund without the need to sell the underlying securities in the secondary markets – in most cases investors in money market funds can gain access to their money within hours: 'saturday' access. It is also possible to put in place a sweep facility so that money is automatically transferred from a bank account (paying little interest), if it exceeds a stated balance, to a money market account (paying more interest) and vice versa – this can be done at the end of each day.

Along with much of the rest of the financial sector money markets went through a crisis in 2008. A money market fund, Reserve Primary Fund, had invested a substantial proportion of its funds in Lehman Brothers short-term debt. When Lehmans went bust the fund was unable to return to investors the amount they had paid into it. This breaking of the buck is a great sin in the money market world – all money market funds are supposed to be incredibly safe. What made it worse was the subsequent freezing-up of credit markets: investors in funds could not withdraw their money at short notice as per the agreement. The market became illiquid because the money market funds could not find buyers for the securities they held and so could not raise cash at the moment when a high proportion of their investors clamoured to withdraw cash. In response, the industry bodies in the US, Europe and elsewhere tightened rules to make sure that there was much more easily accessible cash in the funds – see Exhibit 5.1 for the European response. Note that while the European market is very large at around €400 billion, the US market is even larger, at around 3,800 billion.

# Steve Johnson

Europe's €430bn ($388bn, $630bn) triple-A money market fund industry will have to abide by higher standards of maturity, credit quality, liquidity and disclosure under new guidelines due to be unveiled today.

The move follows a series of problems in the supposedly low risk asset class during the credit crisis. A number of "enhanced" European money market funds suffered double-digit losses and the US Treasury felt compelled to prop up its domestic industry after one vehicle, the Reserve Primary Fund, "broke the buck", losing money for investors.

Although triple-A rated European funds avoided these problems the industry body, the Institutional Money Market Funds Association, has still decided to

Assets in triple-A rated Immaf money market funds By currency type (bn) tighten its guidelines, which are mandatory for members.

Funds will now have to manage liquidity by ensuring at least 5 per cent of assets are held in overnight securities and 20 per cent in securities maturing within one week. This is designed to ensure that funds, which all provide daily liquidity to investors, can meet redemption requests even if the secondary market seizes up. "If liquidity disappears in the market place you cannot sell your assets. The only thing you can rely on is natural liquidity", said Nathan Douglas, secretary general of Immfa.

Immfa has also moved to tighten up credit quality by stipulating that the weighted average final maturity of a fund's assets must be no more than 120 days.

'Triple-A' means that they have independently been assessed as having a very low risk of defaulting. 'Overnight securities' are those where the lender receives back capital and interest one day after lending. An 'enhanced' fund is one that takes more risk (or invests in lower-liquidity securities) to try to generate a higher return. 'Natural liquidity' means holding securities that pay back their capital in a matter of hours or days rather than the holder relying on selling the securities to other investors in the secondary market.

# Functions of money

Before we look at the range of money market instruments and the workings of these markets we need to go right back to basics and discuss what money is and why a rate of return is required.

Money as coinage has been in existence for 3,000 years, evolving from the original barter system, which, as commerce increased, proved to be unduly cumbersome. Under a barter system much time and effort were expended in searching out other individuals interested in a direct trade of one good for another. It soon became apparent that a tool was needed to help make transactions more efficient. People needed something into which all goods and services received could be converted; they needed something small and portable which would hold its value over a long period of time and be universally accepted. Thus people could avoid the necessity of carrying to market the bushels of wheat they had earned by their labour to exchange them for bricks. Instead labour was rewarded by money, which in turn was taken to the market to buy bricks, or any other commodity. Over the years, many varied items have been used as a means of exchange, ranging from cowry shells to cigarettes (in prisons particularly), but gold or silver became the norm. In present times, of course, money is generally represented by paper (bank notes, cheques, etc.), plastic (debit and credit cards) or electronic means.

In any economy, money has three main functions.

- Means of exchange As a means of exchange the barter system was inefficient in that it required the buyer and seller to have mutual and simultaneous wants, a double coincidence of wants. The invention of tokens or coins and later paper and electronic transfers as a means of exchange has revolutionised the world. It has enabled people and companies from diverse parts of the globe to conduct business with each other safe in the knowledge that each party will receive what they are due in terms of goods or payment. Individuals and corporations are able to trade their goods and services for a universally accepted means of exchange – money.
- Unit of account It is important that each unit of coinage represents a particular asset value, is identical to units of the same denomination and that units representing large amounts can be divided into smaller units. In the UK, for example, the unit of account is the pound sterling (£), with 100 sub-units, while in most of Europe the unit of account is the euro (€). To have a standard unit of account is very important for business and personal decisions. Take, for instance, a business with two subsidiaries, operating in different markets – it is very useful to observe their relative performances in terms of a common measuring stick.
- Store of value Money has enabled individuals to hold a store of value and not use it straightaway, as would necessarily happen with many of the goods in the barter system, but to keep it until required for future consumption. This money must be capable of being stored and keep its value until retrieved. An individual or corporate body may not want to spend immediately the amount they have earned but save it for later consumption, and its face value must be the same at the later date. However, due to the inflation process, money, because it is unchangeable and retains simply its face value, is not necessarily the best means of storing value. Fine art, antiques, property and interest-paying bank accounts are just some of the myriad ways of storing value which may provide protection against inflation.

# The time value of money

When people undertake to set aside money for investment, something has to be given up now. For instance, if someone buys shares in a firm or lends to a business, there is a sacrifice of present consumption. One of the incentives to save is the possibility of gaining a higher level of future consumption. Therefore, it is apparent that compensation is required to induce people to make a consumption sacrifice. Compensation will be required for at least three things:

- Impatience to consume: individuals generally prefer to have £1.00 today than £1.00 in five years' time. To put this formally: the utility of £1.00 now is greater than £1.00 received five years hence. Individuals are predisposed towards impatience to consume, thus they need an appropriate reward to begin the saving process. The rate of exchange between certain future consumption and certain current consumption is the pure rate of interest – this occurs even in a world of no inflation and no risk. If you lived in such a world you might be willing to sacrifice £100 of consumption now if you were compensated with £102 to be received in one year. This would mean a pure rate of interest of 2 per cent.
- Inflation: the price of time (or the interest rate needed to compensate for impatience to consume) exists even when there is no inflation, simply because people generally prefer consumption now to consumption later. If there is inflation then the providers of finance will have to be compensated for that loss in purchasing power as well as for time.
- Risk: the promise of the receipt of a sum of money some years hence generally carries with it an element of risk; the payout may not take place or the amount may be less than expected. Risk simply means that the future return has a variety of possible values. Thus, the issuer of a security, whether it be a share, a bond or a bank account, must be prepared to compensate the investor for impatience to consume, inflation and risk involved, otherwise no one will be willing to buy the security.

Take the case of Mrs Ann Investor who is considering a €1,000 one-year investment and requires compensation for three elements of time value:

1 A return of 2 per cent is required for the pure time value of money.

2 Inflation is anticipated to be 3 per cent over the year. At time zero  $(\mathfrak{t}_0)$  €1,000 buys one basket of goods and services. To buy the same basket of goods and services at time  $t_1$  (one year later), €1,030 is needed. To compensate the investor for impatience to consume and inflation, the investment needs to generate a return of 5.06 per cent, that is:

$$
(1 + 0.02)(1 + 0.03) - 1 = 0.0506 = 5.06\%
$$

The figure of 5.06 per cent may be regarded here as the risk-free return (RFR), the interest rate which is sufficient to induce investment assuming no uncertainty about cash flows.

Investors tend to view lending to reputable governments through the purchase of bonds or bills as the nearest they are going to get to risk-free investing, because these institutions have an almost unlimited ability to raise income from taxes or to create money and minimal likelihood of default. This applies only if the country has a reputation for good financial management – Greece, Ireland and Portugal had a troublesome 2010 and 2011 when investors doubted the soundness of their governments' finances; they pushed up the interest rates the governments had to pay to allow for the risk of default (non-payment) way beyond the normal RFR accorded a reputable eurozone government, e.g. Germany.

The RFR forms the bedrock for time value of money calculations as the pure time value and the expected inflation rate affect all investments equally. Whether the investment is in property, bonds, shares or a factory, if expected inflation rises from 3 per cent to 5 per cent then the investor's required return on all investments will increase by 2 per cent.

3 Different investment categories carry different degrees of uncertainty about the outcome of the investment. For instance, an investment on the Russian stock market, with its high volatility, may be regarded as more risky than the purchase of a share in BP with its steady growth prospects. Investors require different risk premiums on top of the RFR to reflect the perceived level of extra risk. Thus: required return (time value of money) = RFR + risk premium

In the case of Mrs Ann Investor, the risk premium pushes up the total return required to, say, 10 per cent, thus giving full compensation for all three elements of the time value of money.

The interest rates quoted in the financial markets are sufficiently high to compensate for all three elements. A ten-year loan to a reputable government (such as the purchase of a bond) may pay an interest rate of 5 per cent per annum. Some of this is compensation for time preference and a little for risk, but the majority of that interest is likely to be compensation for future inflation. The same applies to the cost of capital for a business; when it issues financial securities, the returns offered include a large element of inflation compensation.

The nominal rate of interest is the rate quoted by lenders and includes the inflation element. The real rate of interest removes inflation.

Real rate of interest  $=$  nominal rate of interest - inflation

# The interbank market

Originally, the interbank market was defined as the market where banks lend to each other, in both the domestic and international markets. This is a rather strict (old-fashioned) definition, and increasingly, as well as banks being lenders, this group includes large industrial and commercial companies, other financial institutions and international organisations. Thus, the interbank markets exist so that a bank or other large institution which has no immediate demand for its surplus cash can place the money in the interbank market and earn interest on it. In the opposite scenario, if a bank needs to supply a loan to a customer but does not have the necessary money to hand, it can borrow on the interbank market.

There is no secondary trading in the interbank market; the loans are 'non-negotiable' – thus a lender for, say, three months cannot sell the right to receive interest and capital from the borrower to another organisation after, say, 15 days – the lender has to wait until the end of the agreed loan period to recover money. If a bank needs its funds, it simply ceases to deposit money with other banks.

The loans in this market are not secured with collateral. However, the rate of interest is relatively low because those accepting deposits (borrowers) are respectable and safe banks. This interest rate creates the benchmark (reference) interest rate known as LIBOR - explained in the next section. Banks with lower respectability and safety will have to pay more than the benchmark rates set by the safest institutions.

# Interest rates

In the financial pages of serious newspapers you will find a bewildering variety of interest rates quoted from all over the world. Following is an explanation of some of the terms in common use.

# LIBOR

LIBOR or Libor, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the most commonly used benchmark rate, in particular the three-month LIBOR rate, which is the interest rate for one bank lending to another (very safe) bank for a fixed three-month period.

Obviously these lending deals are private arrangements between the two banks concerned, but we can get a feel for the rates being charged by surveying the leading banks involved in these markets. This is done every trading day. The official LIBOR rates are calculated by the British Banking Association (BBA) by asking a panel of 16 UK and international banks at what rates they could borrow money as unsecured loans of various maturities. Contributor banks are asked to base their LIBOR submissions on the following question: 'At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am?5 The rates from the 16 banks are ranked in order from the highest to the lowest and the arithmetic mean of only the middle two quartiles is taken, i.e. the BBA removes the top four and bottom four rates quoted each day and averages the middle eight rates to calculate LIBOR.

The loans between banks are not just in sterling. London is the leading international financial centre of the world and lending takes place in a variety of currencies. Thus, each day the BBA produces LIBOR interest rates for borrowing in ten currencies with a range of 15 maturities from overnight to 12 months quoted for each currency, producing 150 rates each business day. See Exhibit 5.2 for the LIBOR rates produced on 31 December 2010.

Only the most creditworthy borrowers can borrow at LIBOR; less highly rated borrowers will be able to borrow at LIBOR plus a number of basis points, e.g.  $\mathrm{LIBOR} + 9$ ; so if the three-month LIBOR in US dollars is currently 0.50 per cent, the borrower will pay 9/100 of a percentage point more than this, i.e. 0.59 per cent for three-month borrowing starting today and repayable in three months. These rates are expressed at an annual rate even though the loans may be for only a few days or weeks.

The sterling three-month LIBOR rate has an effect on the rates which are set on a variety of other loans, especially mortgages, to individuals and companies. Because the LIBOR rate is calculated in different currencies, its influence is spread worldwide, and is particularly used in dollar lending outside the US. In all, LIBOR is used to price around 350,000 billion financial products worldwide. Exhibit 5.3 describes how the interest rates in the LIBOR markets declined dramatically during 2008 to leave rates at extraordinarily low levels during 2009 and 2010.

# Little for room Libor to fall further

David Oakley and Ralph Atkins

The year-long decline in money market rates appears to be over.

London Interbank Offered Rates, or Libor, are at record lows for dollars, euro and sterling, leading many pundits to say that they cannot fall much further. Three-month Libor rates have fallen almost to the levels of base rates in the US and the UK - and below the base rates in the eurozone.

The question now is: at what point will they start rising again?

The reason rates have fallen so fast is that the extraordinary measures taken by the world's central banks since the collapse of Lehman Brothers have left the financial sector awash with liquidity.

It is also a clear sign that confidence has returned to the banking system, with institutions willing to lend to each other.

This is because fears over counter-party risk, which came close to breaking the financial system in the days following Lehman, have receded sharply.

The renewed confidence has even enabled some of the stronger banks to borrow well below Libor, which is fixed every day by the British Bankers Association through a survey of London-based banks.

However, bankers warn that Libor rates could start to rise again, undoing some of the efforts of the central banks, should the global economy show any signs of faltering.

In particular, they say, the failure of banks to increase lending to businesses and consumers, which is critical for economic recovery, could put the money markets under strain.

In short, the money market - the first link in the borrowing chain - may appear to be repaired but, without circulation of funds to consumers and businesses, confi dence could start to erode, sending Libor higher.

"Lending rates are very low for banks in the money markets, but they aren't for businesses and consumers," he says. "Many businesses and consumers are also more intent on paying back loans rather than increasing debt in this climate."

It means the economic recovery has reached a critical point, with the markets eagerly watching the money markets for any signs of strain.

Mr Smith says "There is no guarantee that Libor rates can be maintained at the lows, and there is no guarantee that the current extremely loose monetary policy stances will trigger a sustained economic revival."

# EURIBOR and some other BORs

Other rates similar to LIBOR which are in common use include EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), which is the rate at which euro interbank term deposits are offered by one prime bank to another prime bank within the eurozone (not London) for periods of one week to one year. It does not cover overnight lending – see EONIA below for that. EURIBOR is calculated as a weighted average of unsecured lending transactions undertaken within the euro area by Eurozone banks.

Many other countries have markets setting rates for lending between domestic banks. TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate) is the rate at which Japanese banks lend to each other in Japan. In Singapore we have SIBOR and in Hong Kong we have HIBOR.

# Federal Funds Rate and Prime Rate

In the US, the equivalent to very short-term LIBOR is the Federal Funds Rate (fed funds), the rate at which domestic financial institutions lend to each other for a period of one day. This is strongly influenced by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Banks often need to borrow from other banks to maintain a minimum level of reserves at the Federal Reserve. The lending banks are happy to lend because they receive a rate of interest and the money is released the next day (usually). This borrowing is usually unsecured (without collateral) and so is available only to the most creditworthy. The Federal Reserve can influence the fed funds rate by increasing or lowering the level of cash or near-cash reserves the banks have to hold and other market interventions. There is more on the role of the Federal Reserve and the fed funds rate in Chapter 7.

The fed funds interest rate (borrowing in the US) and the overnight US dollar LIBOR rate (borrowing in the UK) are usually very close to each other because they are near-perfect substitutes. If they were not close then a bank could make a nice profit borrowing in one overnight market and depositing the money in another. If the US dollar LIBOR rate is higher, banks needing to borrow will tend to do so in the fed funds market; the increased demand will push up interest rates there, while the absence of demand will encourage lower rates in the US dollar LIBOR market.

The US prime rate is the interest rate US banks charge the best corporate customers. It is also used as a benchmark for other loans, e.g. consumer credit loan interest rates are often set as so many basis points above the prime rate.

# EONIA

EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average) is the effective overnight rate for the euro. It is calculated with the help of the European Central Bank (ECB) as a weighted average of overnight unsecured lending transactions undertaken within the euro area by Eurozone banks.

# EURONIA

EURONIA (Euro Overnight Index Average) is the UK equivalent of EONIA, a weighted average of euro interest rates on unsecured overnight euro deposits arranged by eight money brokers in London.

# SONIA

SONIA (Sterling Overnight Interbank Average) tracks the actual sterling overnight rates experienced by market participants (calculated by the wholesale Markets Brokers Association).

# Eurocurrency

Eurocurrency has a large part to play in the interbank market as well as other lending/borrowing markets. The terms Eurocurrency, Eurodollar, Euroyen, Euroswissfrancs, etc. have nothing to do with the actual euro currency; their name simply means that the currency is deposited and lent outside the jurisdiction of the country that issued the currency. For example, a Japanese bank might make a deposit in yen in a German bank; this would be a Euroyen deposit. An American corporation might pay a Swiss corporation in dollars; these dollars are deposited in a Swiss bank and are Eurodollars.

Today, it is not unusual to find an individual holding a dollar account at a UK bank – a Eurodeposit account – which pays interest in dollars linked to general dollar rates. This money can be lent to firms wishing to borrow in Eurodollars prepared to pay interest and capital repayments in dollars. The point is that both the Euroyen deposit and the Eurodollars are outside the control of their country of origin – the regulators have little influence on this market.

Eurocurrence markets came about after the Second World War when substantial amounts of US dollars were deposited in Europe (mainly in London) during the 1950s and 1960s. Countries outside the US were wary about depositing their dollars in US banks, where they would be subject to stringent US regulations. Regulation Q of the US Banking Act of 1933 prohibited banks from paying interest on commercial demand deposits. Additionally, 'Iron Curtain' countries were worried that their dollars could be seized or frozen for political reasons if they were placed where the rule of the US authorities was in force. Countries earning dollars, especially oil-producing countries, looked for banks outside the US where they could deposit their US dollars and earn market rates of interest. US corporations began to expand into Europe and wanted their funds outside the control of the US authorities. So the Eurocurrence market was born, although strictly speaking the term should be international market.

The title 'Euro' came about because the modern market was started when the former Soviet Union transferred dollars from New York to a Russian-owned bank in Paris bank at the height of the cold war in 1957. The cable address happened to be EUROBANK. This was long before the currency called the euro was conceived. Nowadays, there is daily Eurosecurities business transacted in all of the major financial centres. To add a little precision: 'Eurocurrency' is short-term (less than one year) deposits and loans outside the jurisdiction of the country in whose currency the deposit/loan is denominated. These are term ('time') deposits that may be fixed for just one day (overnight) or for a longer period such as three months. Eurocredit is used for the market in mediumand long-term loans in the Euromarkets, with lending rates usually linked to (a few basis points above) the LIBOR rates. Loans longer than six months normally have interest rates that are reset every three or six months depending on the LIBOR rate then prevailing for, say, three-month lending. Thus the interest rate is floating rather than fixed (constant throughout the lending term). So a corporate borrower with a two-year loan that starts off paying three-month LIBOR plus 150 basis points when three-month LIBOR is 3 per cent pays 4.5 per cent. This is expressed as an annual rate – the borrower will pay only one-quarter of this for three months. If, at the start of the next three months, the three-month LIBOR rate has moved to 3.45 per cent the corporate will pay 4.95 per cent (annual rate) for three months.

The companies which are large enough to use the Eurosecurities markets are able to put themselves at a competitive advantage vis-à-vis smaller firms. There are at least four advantages:

The finance available in these markets can be at a lower cost in both transaction costs and rates of return.

- There are fewer rules and regulations such as needing to obtain official authorisation to issue or needing to queue to issue, leading to speed, innovation and lower costs.
- There may be the ability to hedge foreign currency movements. For example, if a firm has assets denominated in a foreign currency it can be advantageous to also have liabilities in that same currency to reduce the adverse impact of exchange-rate movements (see Chapter 12 for hedge currency risk).
- National markets are often not able to provide the same volume of finance. The borrowing needs of some firms are simply too large for their domestic markets to supply. To avoid being hampered in expansion plans, large firms can turn to the international market for finance.

The Eurodollar market has become so deep and broad that it now sets interest rates back in the mother country of the dollar. A very large proportion of US domestic commercial loans and commercial paper interest rates are set at a certain number of basis points above US dollar LIBOR rates determined by banks operating out of London.

The Eurocurrency market allows countries and corporations to lend and borrow funds worldwide, picking the financial institution which is the most suitable regardless of geographic position. While the world economy is thriving, this works well. However, some spectacular problems were highlighted in 2008. For example, Iceland's financial institutions found themselves in trouble after they found themselves unable to renew loans in the international debt markets.

# Treasury bills

Throughout the world, government agencies issue Treasury bills (T-bills or Treasury notes). They are negotiable securities, which means that they can easily be traded in the secondary market and thus easily liquidated to release cash. They can be one of the most risk-free forms of investing (if you are lending to financially stable governments), but pay a lower return for this reason. If a government is short of money because tax revenues are slow to come in, it can issue T-bills to increase funds. T-bills form by far the largest part of the money markets and are generally sold by auction through a national government agency.

# UK Treasury bills

In the UK Treasury bills were first issued by the Bank of England in the early 1700s, when there occurred the first concept of money as an amount written on a piece of paper rather than an actual piece of metal with an intrinsic value. They are now issued at weekly tenders by the Debt Management Office (DMO) with a face value or par value of £100 and are sold at a discount to par value with a maturity date of one month (28 days), three months (91 days), six months (182 days) or twelve months. They are sold initially by competitive tender to a small group of banks, which can sell them on in turn to other investors. Most holders of Treasury bills are financial institutions. Individuals may hold them, but the minimum purchase amount is £500,000.

Those banks that wish to purchase compete in the weekly tender by placing bids as defined by the yield they will accept. The bids are gathered and different yield prices accepted: the DMO determines what is the highest accepted yield and allocates bills to purchasers bidding below this yield. Purchasers bidding at the accepted yield may not receive the amount they bid for.

The buyer purchases a bill at a discount and may keep it until maturity and receive the par value back. Alternatively, the bill may be sold in an active secondary market to another investor. The T-bill markets are both deep (many buyers and sellers) and liquid, so there is little risk that a holder cannot sell when they want to with low transaction costs. During the time he has held the bill, he has made a yield or investment return, the difference between the price paid and the maturity value (or sale price in the secondary market), and this yield is calculated as an annual percentage which can then be compared with other types of investment.

There are two important considerations to take note of when undertaking any calculations associated with T-bills (and other money market securities):

1 In any calculations it is important to be aware of the day count convention. For ease of calculation, some countries/markets use a 30-day month and 360-day year, rather than the actual variable days in a month and a 365-day year, or 366 in a leap year. This can get complicated when the repayment date falls on the 31st of a month. There are various methods for dealing with this. Other markets use the precise number of days until redemption of the instrument and the real number of days in a year. Great care must always be taken to check which daycount convention is being used and to understand terminology, e.g. actual/360, 30/360, actual/actual, actual/365, and so on; it is imperative that an investor knows which convention is being used and how it works. In general the UK still uses the 365-day year in its sterling transactions.

2 The difference between bond equivalent yield and discount yield.

a The bond equivalent yield, bey (also known as coupon equivalent rate or equivalent bond yield), is the yield that is quoted in newspapers and it allows comparison of fixed-income securities whose payments are not annual with securities that have annual yields. So a wide variety of debt instrument yield is expressed in the same annual terms, even those that mature in a matter of days, those that have interest paid every three months as well as those with one-yearly interest payment. To calculate the bey:

$$
\frac{\text{Di sc ou nt (th at is ,F ac eV al ue -P ur ch as eP ri ce)}}{\text{Pu rc ha se Pr ic e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}
$$

See Example 1 for a simple use of this idea.

# Example 1 Bond equivalent rate

If we need to calculate the yield rate (bond equivalent rate or bey) for a 12-month £100 UK Treasury bill which was sold at a discount of 2 per cent, i.e. at £98, then we recognise that the investment made is £98 and we gain £2 when it is redeemed in one year. Thus we know that the true rate of return is slightly over 2 per cent. Given that there is a full year to maturity (assuming the day-count convention is a 365-day year), we know this is going to be the annual rate:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{be y} = \frac{\text{Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce}}{\text{Pu rc ha se Pr ic e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \times 1 0 0 = \text{an nu al ra te} \\ \mathrm{bey} = \frac{100 - 98}{98}\times \frac{365}{365}\times 100 = 2.04\% \\ \end{array}
$$

(Appendix 5.2 at the end of this chapter runs through the key mathematical tools of finance. If your understanding is a little rusty you might like to read through that now and attempt the exercises.) b The discount yield (also known as discount basis or discount rate or rate of discount) is the yield when using the face value as the base rather than the actual amount invested by the buyer. To calculate the discount yield:

$$
\frac{\text{Di sc ou nt (Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce)}}{\text{Fa ce Va lu e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}
$$

See Example 2.

# Example 2 Discount yield

For a T-bill issued at £98 when the face value is £100 and the time to maturity is one year:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d = \frac{\text{(Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce)}}{\text{Fa ce Va lu e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \times 1 0 0 = \text{an nu al pe rc en ta ge ra te} \\ d = \frac{(100 - 98)}{100} \times \frac{365}{365} \times 100 = 2 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

Just to emphasise: note that the yield rate (bey) is greater than the discount yield rate because the yield is earned on the purchase (discounted) price, not on the face value.

Exhibit 5.4 shows the results from the four sales of Treasury bills which took place weekly during February 2011, on the 4th, 11th, 18th and 25th. Note that the issues occurred at weekly intervals as the UK government borrowed more money or simply replaced maturing debt. The bills must be settled (paid for) and are issued on the next working day (generally the following Monday). The redemption date is the day when the face value of the bill (100) will be paid to the holder. The nominal amount is the total amount of the face value of the bills offered at the tender (not what was actually paid for them).

The bid to cover ratio is the ratio of the amount that was actually bid and the amount of T-bills offered; if the number is greater than 1 it shows that there were more bids than the amount on offer. Although extremely rare, it is not unknown for an offer to be undersubscribed – it is a sign of lack of confidence in the government's financial situation and/or indigestion in a market faced with an exceptionally high volume of government borrowing. The average yield is expressed as an annual rate (bond equivalent yield). In this month, Treasury bills yielded a rate as low as 0.4419 per cent per annum, or around 0.0368 per cent per month. The average price is the price paid by purchasers for bills which will pay the holders of the bills £100 in one month, three months or six months.

# Example 3

If we take the three-month Treasury bill sold at tender on 18 February at a discount price of £99.867658, we can work out the discount (d), yield (bey) and purchase price. Note that the time difference between the date of purchase and redemption is only 91 days in this case and we must express these interest rates in annual terms, so we multiply by 365/91.

Discount yield:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d = \frac{\text{(Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce)}}{\text{Fa ce Va lu e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \times 1 0 0 = \text{an nu al ra te} \\ d = \frac{(100 - 99.867658)}{100} \times \frac{365}{91} \times 100 = 0.530822 \% (\text{expressedasanannualrate}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Yield (on the Purchase Price):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{be y} = \frac{\text{(Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce)}}{\text{Pu rc ha se Pr ic e}} \times \frac{3 6 5}{9 1} \times 1 0 0 \\ \mathrm{bey} = \frac{100 - 99.867658}{99.867658}\times \frac{365}{91}\times 100 = 0.531526\% (\text{expressedasanannualrate}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Purchase price:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P u r c h a s e P r i c e = \text{Fa ce Va lu e} \times \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{\text{Di sc ou nt} \times \text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}\right) \right] \\ \text{Pu rc ha se Pr ic e} = 1 0 0 \times \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{0 . 0 0 5 3 0 8 2 2 \times 9 1}{3 6 5}\right) \right] = £ 9 9. 8 6 7 6 5 8 \\ \end{array}
$$

The results for the tender of this 18 February bill are shown in Exhibit 5.5. From this it can be noted that the actual bids from buyers varied from a yield of 0.51 per cent to a high of 0.548 per cent, with an average of 0.531527 per cent. The bill was over-tendered by a factor of 3.19, i.e. the amount on offer was £1 billion (at face value), and there were actual bids offered totalling £3.1905 billion.

Note: the price is what a purchaser would pay for the bill on a particular day. The price increases as the days to maturity decrease, and on redemption day, in this case 23 May 2011, the holder will receive the face value of £100. The yield in Exhibit 5.6 is the (annual) return (bey) that a purchaser in the secondary market will achieve between purchase date and maturity date.

# Emerging-market Treasury bills

Many emerging-market economies are now able to issue Treasury bills in their own currencies, while others concentrate issuance in one of the major world currencies, especially the US dollar. By borrowing in the US dollar or another international currency the lenders can borrow at lower interest rates because the international lenders are less fearful of a decline in the local currency, but this means that when the country has to redeem the T-bills it faces the risk that the dollar has risen against the local currency and so more local currency than initially thought needs to be paid out to lenders. This problem has caused financial crises in a number of countries over the years, e.g. Mexico in 1995, Russia in 1998 and Brazil in 1999.

# US Treasury Bills

In the US, Treasury bills are sold by Treasury Direct (www.treasurydirect.gov), which is part of the US Department of the Treasury. The bills range in maturity from a few days to 52 weeks, with 4-week, 13-week (91 days) and 26-week (182 days) bills being the most common. They are sold at a discount to par value by auction every week, except for the 52-week bills, which are auctioned every four weeks. The auctions are held regularly and the bidders can bid for the bills in two ways (they have to choose one route or the other at the outset):

- Competitive This is where potential buyers specify the discount rate they are willing to accept. These bids may be (a) accepted in the full amount the bidder wanted if the discount rate they specified is less than the discount rate set by the auction. This threshold rate is determined by the Treasury, which, when all the bids are gathered in, sets the level of discount that will shift the bill quantity required. Competitive bids are accepted in ascending order until the quantity reaches the amount offered; (b) accepted only partially (the bidder does not receive the full amount of bills bid for) if their bid is the same as the cut-off level that sells the amount of bills the government is trying to sell in that auction; or (c) rejected if the bidder stated a level of discount that is higher than that set at the auction.

# or
- Non-competitive This is where the buyer agrees to accept the rate or yield which is set at the auction (in other words, the price set by other investors). With a non-competitive bid the buyer is guaranteed to receive the bill to the full amount of bills they wanted. This is a good method for individual investors who are not expert security traders and therefore can avoid calculating bill discount rates.

All bidders, competitive and non-competitive, receive the same discount rate, and therefore the same yield, at the highest accepted bid, and so pay the same amount for their bills.

Individuals may bid and the minimum purchase is  \$100, unlike in the UK where the minimum bid is\$ 500,000 and individuals may not bid themselves but hold UK Treasury bills only through one of the approved bidders.

Exhibit 5.7 gives the results of US T-bill auctions held during February 2011.

If we take the 26-week T-bill which was auctioned on 22 February 2011 below its par value at 99.921639, we can work out the following figures:

# Example 4 US Treasury bill issue

To calculate the discount yield,  $d$ , on the 26-week US T-bill sold on 24 February 2011 at a discount price of 99.921639:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d = \frac{\text{(Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce)}}{\text{Fa ce Va lu e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \times 1 0 0 \\ d = \frac{(100 - 99.921639)}{100} \times \frac{360}{182} \times 100 = 0.155 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

To calculate the purchase price of the same bill:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P u r c h a s e P r i c e = \text{Fa ce Va lu e} \times \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{\text{Di sc ou nt} \times \text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}\right) \right] \\ \text{Pu rc ha se Pr ic e} = 1 0 0 \times \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{0 . 0 0 1 5 5 \times 1 8 2}{3 6 0}\right) \right] = £ 9 9. 9 2 1 6 3 9 \\ \end{array}
$$

To calculate the actual investment rate of return (bond equivalent yield, bey) from this bill, a 365-day year is used (because a 360-day year would underestimate the return – we use a 366-day year in leap years):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{be y} = \frac{\text{Fa ce Va lu e -P ur ch as eP ri ce}}{\text{Pu rc ha se Pr ic e}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \times 1 0 0 \\ \mathrm{bey} = \frac{100 - 99.921639}{99.921639}\times \frac{365}{182}\times 100 = 0.157276\% \text{perannum} ^{11} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\left[ 1 + \frac{0.00157276}{365 / 182} \right]^{365 / 182} - 1 \times 100 = 0.157338 \%
$$

Another example:

You invested for three months and received a 'simple' annual yield of 3 per cent. This is an annual rate that does not allow for compounding over the year, i.e. interest received on interest added after each quarter is ignored. The effective annual rate is:

$$
\left[ 1 + \frac{0 . 0 3}{4 / 1} \right]^{4 / 1} - 1 \times 1 0 0 = 3. 0 3 3 9
$$

Thus, you receive an extra 0.0339 per cent because after three months you reinvest the maturity amount including interest from the first investment in an identical investment for the remaining nine months. And do the same after six months and nine months. Thus, you receive interest on interest received of 0.0339 per cent. This is, of course, assuming identical investments every three months. While this is unrealistic, at least the EAR provides a gauge of the 'true' annual rate offered on short-term securities.

# The inverse relation between bill prices and interest rates

Say you bought a money market instrument with a maturity of six months. Presumably you were willing to pay the price you did because at that price the instrument offers the same rate of return as other instruments with the same level of risk and time to maturity. Now, imagine that two weeks later interest rates on five-and-a-half-month instruments being issued at that time suddenly shoot up (perhaps there has been a loss in confidence throughout the system, or a great increase in the supply of instruments occurs). Now there are securities being issued that offer any buyer a much higher rate of return to maturity than your bill. In the secondary market for your instrument potential buyers are unwilling to pay the price they did only a few days ago because such a high price equals a low discount-from-maturity value and a low effective interest rate. Now that there are alternative investments around that offer much higher interest rates, the discount on your bill will grow larger as the price people are willing to pay falls (people sell yours and buy alternatives), until the rate of return is the same as other instruments in the market.

Thus we see the inverse relation between prices of money market securities in the secondary market and the effective interest rate to maturity: a rise in bill prices means interest rates fall; a fall in bill prices causes interest rates to rise.

# Central banks

Central banks are crucial to the working of a number of the money markets. One of the roles of a central bank is to keep the wheels of the financial world moving. They issue money (bank notes and coins), help set the domestic base rate of interest and maintain the stability of the financial system through open market operations, i.e. the buying or selling of money market securities to even out the liquidity in the economy. In the UK, the Bank of England sets the key benchmark interest rate for short-term lending by banks, often called the base rate. The European Central Bank based in Frankfurt performs a similar role for short-term euro lending, and in the US the Federal Reserve sets the federal funds rate.

Central banks exert control over their domestic banks, insisting that banks hold a deposit with them. They may deliberately keep banks short of liquidity and thereby reduce the amount of money available, which has the effect of increasing interest rates. Alternatively, they may release more liquidity into the markets, causing interest rates to fall. There is much more on the role of central banks in Chapter 7.

# Commercial paper

Commercial paper (CP) is an unsecured short-term instrument of debt, issued primarily by corporations to help with financing their accounts receivables (debtor), inventories (stock) and meeting short-term cash needs, but can also be issued by banks and municipalities. The issue and purchase of commercial paper is one means by which the largest commercial organisations can avoid paying a bank intermediary a middleman fee for linking borrower and lender, e.g. corporations can avoid borrowing through loans from a bank and go direct to the financial market lenders.

Commercial paper promises to the holder a sum of money to be paid in a set number of days – it is a promissory note. The lender buys these short-term IOUs (I owe you's) and effectively lends money to the issuer.[12] The buyers include other corporations, insurance companies, pension funds, governments and banks. The investors in commercial paper buy it mostly from dealers, which are usually banks.

Commercial paper has an average maturity of about 40 days; the normal range is 30-90 days, but can be as long as 270 days. Normally these instruments are issued at a discount rather than the borrower being required to pay interest - thus the face value (amount paid on redemption) tion) will be higher than the amount paid for the paper at issuance.[13] The discount rate (and the yield gained by the lender) tends to be higher than for Treasury bills because there is a greater element of risk of default (the borrower may not repay) and because there is less liquidity in the secondary market.

Large corporations with temporary surpluses of cash are able to put that money to use by lending it directly to other commercial firms at a higher rate of effective interest than they might have received by depositing the funds in a bank. This source of finance is in general available only to the most respected corporations with the highest credit ratings (see the next section for a discussion of credit ratings) and is therefore usually issued with no collateral – that is, with no assets pledged by the borrower to be used to pay the obligation should it fail to do so by other means.

The main buyers, such as money market funds, are often restricted to having the bulk of their portfolios invested in those issues regarded by the credit rating agencies as carrying the lowest risk of default. Demand is very limited for lower-rated issues. In some countries using credit rating agencies to rate CP is rare, with the investors buying paper on the basis of the strength of the name of the organisation issuing it - only the largest, most well-known and trusted can issue in these places.

Some companies, such as General Electric, are such frequent issuers of CP that they employ in-house teams to do the selling. Other issuers ask dealers (usually employed by investment banks) either to buy the issue with the expectation of selling it on, or to use 'their best endeavours' to find lenders.

The secondary market in commercial paper is weak or non-existent – while dealers might be found who will buy commercial paper from a lender, it is not easy to complete such deals and can be costly.[14]

Although any one issue of commercial paper is short term, it is possible to use this market as a medium-term source of finance by rolling over issues. That is, as one issue matures, another one is launched. A commercial paper programme (a revolving underwriting facility) can be set up by a bank. In this situation, the bank (or a syndicate of banks) underwrites a specified maximum sum for a period of 5-7 years. The borrower then draws on this every few weeks or months by the issue of commercial paper to other lenders. If there are no bids for the paper the underwriting banks buy the paper at a specified price. A multi-currency programme can be arranged in which the issuer can select from a range of currencies when issuing a particular CP under a long-term programme. There is also extendable commercial paper – the issuer has a target date for redemption, but is not obligated to do so; it can extend the life of the paper (usually up to a total of 270 days).

Because it is a short-term source of funds it is best to use CP to finance operating expenses or current assets, such as accounts receivable (debtors) or inventories. It would be dangerous to use it to finance fixed assets, such as machinery or land and buildings, because it has to be paid back in a matter of days. While roll-over is often possible, it is by no means guaranteed and many companies have been caught out by relying too much on expecting to roll over.

# US commercial paper (USCP)

The largest commercial paper market in the world, by far, is the US, distantly followed by Japan, Canada, France, the UK and other developed economies. Reuters reports that the commercial paper market in the US peaked in August 2007 to a total of  \$2,200 billion when the credit crisis happened. By mid-February 2011, the total had dropped to\$ 1,041 billion. To put this in perspective, the output of all Americans in one year (gross domestic product) is around \$14,000 billion. Of the issuance in February 2011, \$355.8 billion was US asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), i.e.

commercial paper secured on the collateral of assets such as receivables – for example, the issuer has the right to receive monthly interest from mortgage payers, credit card holders, vehicle loans or some other regular income and uses this cash flow to pay the commercial paper when it becomes due and to provide collateral.[15]

According to US law, because its maturity is less than 270 days, commercial paper does not have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the main US financial regulator, and therefore is not subject to the time-consuming and costly registration process required by US federal regulations. The largest US-based financial and other corporate issuers of commercial paper, including both asset-backed and unsecured paper, are General Electric Co and Citigroup Inc followed by Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley.

The commercial paper market can be very influential in corporate life. For example, in 2005, Standard & Poor's downgraded the commercial paper of Ford and General Motors, making their commercial paper unattractive to investors and thus increasing the cost of financing to these companies, and reducing the global confidence in both the companies and their products. This contributed to their financial crisis in 2009, when General Motors was forced into bankruptcy.

# Eurocommercial paper (Euro-CP)

This is paper which is issued and placed outside the jurisdiction of the country in whose currency it is denominated. So an American corporation might issue commercial paper denominated in Japanese yen outside the control of the Japanese authorities, and this is classified as Eurocommercial paper. The most common denominations are euros, US dollars and GB pounds.

# Example 5 Commercial paper

A dealer buys  \$2 million worth of Eurodollar commercial paper from a borrowing company with a 60-day maturity at a discounted price of\$ 1,994,874. For Eurodollar (and most other Eurocurrency deals) interest is calculated using the 360-day count convention.

The discount yield (using an actual/360 day count) is:

$$

Commercial paper is a crucial source of short-term funding for companies, banks and other borrowers as they manage their weekly or monthly operations and cash flows.

The market was hit hard first in 2007 by fears over the subprime mortgage exposures of mainly bank-run off-balance sheet vehicles known as structured investment vehicles (Sivs) and conduits.

But following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, the rush by investors to pull cash out of any money market funds that did not invest solely in US Treasuries led to more widespread collapse in commercial paper.

One of the most encouraging aspects of the short-term debt markets came from the details about how much commercial paper the Fed was buying through its support programmes to help ensure borrowers get the funding they need.

The asset-backed CP market, which was at the centre of the fears over Sivs and conduits, expanded by 46.3bn but at the same time the Fed's holdings in its ABCP liquidity facility dropped by almost 1bn to 22.9bn. Its holdings peaked at 145.8bn in mid October.

# Credit ratings

Firms often pay to have their bonds and short-term borrowing instruments rated by specialist credit-rating organisations. The rating given is an evaluation made by the rating agency of the firm's ability to repay its debt and will affect the interest rate on the debt instruments. Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings are the three most important credit-rating companies. Each uses slightly different terminology for their rating system - see Exhibit 5.9.

Many government-issued securities have an insignificant risk of default. We would expect that firms in stable industries and with conservative accounting and financing policies and a risk-averse business strategy would have a lower risk of default and therefore a higher credit rating than a firm with greatly fluctuating income and high borrowing.

The highest ratings (AAA for long-term bonds and P-1, A-1+ and F1+ for short-term borrowing) indicate that the capacity to repay interest and principal is extremely strong; the lower ratings (B, Cs and Ds) indicate that there is an increased likelihood of default. Debt rated BB has speculative characteristics, but it is not as likely to default as debt rated CC, which has some protection but there are significant uncertainties and major risks with it. The top part of the table shows the ratings regarded as investment grade. This is important because many

The difference in yield between the different grades in the investment-grade group can be as little as 30 basis points, but this can rise dramatically at times of financial trauma, e.g. in early 2009.

Bonds rated below investment grade are called high-yield (or junk) bonds – discussed in Chapter 6. Short-term securities, such as commercial paper rated B and C, are not prime, or medium or low grade, or second-tier and third-tier, and may have limited demand, because of the increased risk. The attraction to lenders of low-grade commercial paper can be enhanced by the issuing company obtaining a line of credit from a bank, under which the bank agrees to make the due payment on the CP should the company be unable to do so.

The rating can be carried out on the firm, but, for bonds and commercial paper, is usually related only to the particular bond or CP. If a loan does not have a rating it could be that the borrower has not paid for one, rather than implying anything more sinister.

The rating and re-rating of bonds and short-term instruments is followed with great interest by borrowers and lenders and can give rise to some heated argument. Credit ratings are of great concern to the borrowing corporation because those with lower ratings tend to have higher costs. Occasionally the ratings agencies disagree over the rating of a loan, in which case it is said to have a split rating.

It has been suggested that during the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 the credit-rating agencies gave unduly high ratings to loans that were shaky. The agencies were widely regarded as financial watchdogs, and investors have relied on their ratings of public companies and securities to gauge risk and make investment decisions, yet too many of their highly rated investments proved to be risky and speculative.

# Repos

A repo is a way of borrowing for a few days using a sale and repurchase agreement in which securities are sold for cash at an agreed price with a promise to buy back the securities at a specified (higher) price at a future date. The interest on the agreement is the difference between the initial sale price and the agreed buy-back, and because the agreements are usually collateralised (secured) by government-backed securities such as Treasury bills, the interest rate is lower than a typical unsecured loan from a bank. While collateral back-up for the lender is usually provided by the borrower handing over very safe government-issued securities, other very safe securities might be used. If the borrower defaults on its obligations to buy back on maturity, the lender can hold on to or sell the securities.

Repos (RPs) are used very regularly by banks and other financial institutions to borrow money from each other. Companies do use the repo markets, but much less frequently than the banks. This market is also manipulated by central banks to manage their monetary policy – see Chapter 7.

The best way to understand the repo market is through an example - see Example 6.

# Example 6 A repo using actual data

A high-street bank needs to borrow £6 million for 14 days. It agrees to sell a portfolio of its financial assets, in this case government bonds, to a lender for £6 million. An agreement is drawn up (a repo) by which the bank agrees to repurchase the portfolio 14 days later for £6,001,219.73. The extra sum of £1,219.73 represents the interest on £6 million over 14 days at an annual rate of 0.53 per cent. The calculation is:

$$
\text{In te rs t} = \text{Se ll in gP ri ce} \times \text{In te rs tR at e} \times \frac{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}
$$

$$
\text{In te rs t} = 6, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times \frac{0 . 5 3}{1 0 0} \times \frac{1 4}{3 6 5} = £ 1, 2 1 9. 7 3
$$

The term for repos is usually between 1 and 14 days, but can be up to a year and occasionally there is no end date – this is called an open repo.

A reverse repo (RRP) is the lender's side of the transaction, an agreement in which securities are purchased with a promise to sell them back at an agreed price at a future date. Traders may do this to gain interest. Alternatively, it could be to cover another market transaction. For example, a trading house may need to obtain some Treasury bills or bonds temporarily because it has shorted them – sold them before buying – and needs to find a supply to meet its obligations, so it places a reverse repo order to get an inflow of the securities now. In a transaction, the terms repo and reverse repo are used according to which party initiated the transaction, i.e. if a seller initiates the transaction, it is a repo; if the transaction is initiated by a buyer, it is a reverse repo.

Repos are very useful for banks and other financial institutions which hold large quantities of money market securities such as T-bills. They can gain access to liquidity through the repo for a few days while maintaining a high level of inventory in short-term securities.

# Example 7 A repo using actual data

A company owning £20 million worth of Treasury bills wishes to raise cash on 28 February 2011 and enters into an agreement to sell the bills and buy them back in one week's time. The agreed buy-back price would be £20 million plus the accrued interest. The annual rate of interest on 28 February for a one-week repo is shown in Exhibit 5.10 as 0.52167 per cent.

$$
\text{Bu y -b ac kP ri ce} = \text{Se ll in gP ri ce} + \left(\text{Se ll in gP ri ce} \times \text{In te rs tR at e} \times \frac{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}\right)

$$

# Haircuts

Although the securities bought and sold are generally considered safe collateral for the lender of the cash, there is always the danger that the price of the bills, etc. may fluctuate during the period of the agreement to the detriment of the buyer. Therefore it is common practice to impose a haircut on the collateral, where the seller receives the amount of cash secured on the collateral less a margin (the haircut). If the haircut is 0.075 per cent in Example 7, the seller would receive £19,985,000 in return for £20 million worth of securities, and the repo interest is applied only to the lesser amount. The buyer (lender) pays out £19,985,000, but has securities worth £20 million, and receives interest on the amount of cash lent – see Example 8.

# Example 8 A repo with a haircut

Using the figures from Example 7, the buy-back price can then be calculated:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{Bu y -b ac kP ri ce} = \text{Se ll in gP ri ce} + \left[ \left(\text{Se ll in gP ri ce} - \text{Ha ir cu t}\right) \times \text{In te rs tR at e} \times \frac{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}} \right] \\ \text{Bu y -b ac kP ri ce} = 2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 + \left[ \left(2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 - \left\{2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times \frac{0 . 0 7 5}{1 0 0} \right\}\right) \times \frac{0 . 5 2 1 6 7}{1 0 0} \times \frac{7}{3 6 5} \right] = £ 2 0, 0 0 1, 9 9 9. 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

Repo deals are individually negotiated between the two parties and are therefore designed to suit the length of time of borrowing for each of them, thus there is usually little need for redemption before the agreed date. However, if circumstances change and the lender needs the money quickly, it might be possible to arrange an off-setting reverse repo transaction.

Exhibit 5.11 shows how the repo market declined after the collapse of Lehman's. It also points out how dependent the US market is on two banks and how the collateral used in the run-up to the crisis deteriorated.

# Exhibit 5.11

# Run on banks left repo sector highly exposed

By Michael Mackenzie in New York

FT

The sharp reduction in financial leverage since the collapse of Lehman Brothers is illustrated by the steep decline in the use of repurchase or repo transactions by Wall Street dealers.

In a repo, an investor can borrow cash for a short period from another party, using securities as collateral for the loan. Investors with large portfolios of securities can thus lend these out and earn a return over time.

Federal Reserve data shows that financing volumes of mortgages, US Treasuries and corporate debt by primary dealers has dropped nearly 50 per cent from levels seen before Lehman's demise. Overall repo activity in the US during the first six months of this year has fallen to levels not seen since 2003.

"Everybody now pays more attention to due diligence and looks at their counter party risk a lot more closely," says Scott Skyrm, senior vice-president at Newedge, a repo broker dealer.

At the centre of the US repo market sits the tri-party model, where a custodian bank, Bank of New York Mellon and JPMorgan helps to administer a repo agreement between two parties. An investor places its money with the custodian bank, which in turn lends it to another institution, and then assets are pledged as collateral for the loan.

Such a model functions well when liquid assets such as Treasuries are being used, as this type of collateral can easily be sold.

During the credit boom, which peaked in the first half of 2007, the type of collateral being pledged for cash in repo transactions, had steadily migrated away from Treasuries and towards other assets such as private label mortgages and corporate securities. This reflected the drive by investment banks and investors to boost their leverage and garner higher returns.

"The tri-party repo framework that worked so well for Treasuries was not as robust for less liquid securities," says Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson Icap. "The system works if the clearing banks are confident that they can liquidate collateral quickly."

The near-failure of Bear Stearns six months before Lehman's demise alerted the Fed to the dangers associated with having two clearing banks supporting the financial system.

Tri-party was very popular with investment banks as it is allowed them to finance their balance sheets with short-term funding.

But as soon as market sentiment turned negative on lower quality or more complex assets, investors who had funded these repo agreements began to pull their money out. That sparked a run on the investment banks, potentially exposing the clearing banks. This has left regulators and the market with one big fear: if one clearing bank ran into trouble, could the other step forward and support the system? There is also a separate issue, which is that when investors become worried about a particular institution, any move by a clearing bank to tighten standards could spark a bigger run on the borrower in question that ultimately results in bankruptcy or rescue.

"There were a lot of assets that should not have been used as collateral in the repo market to start with. Repo is not a one-size fits-all market," says Joseph Abate, money markets strategist at Barclays Capital.

# Local authority/municipal bills

Local authorities issue these short-term instruments to finance capital expenditure and cash flow needs. They are not common in the UK, but widely used in the US, Brazil and Canada where they are issued by many states, cities and local governments. A big attraction in the US is that the interest (but not the capital gain) is generally free of federal (and sometimes state and local) income taxes. They tend to be regarded as safe investments. There is a strong market in local authority bills and bonds in many European countries, notably France, Italy and Germany, where individual federal states issue them regularly. There are also many bill issues by companies close to governments, e.g. the French railway, SNCF, or the German postal service, Deutsche Bundespost.

# Certificates of deposit (CDs)

Certificates of deposit are issued by banks when funds are deposited with them by other banks, corporations, individuals or investment companies. The certificates state that a deposit has been made (a time deposit) and that at the maturity date the bank will pay a sum higher than that originally deposited. The maturities can be any length of time between a week and a year (typically 1-4 months) $^{16}$  and can be negotiable $^{17}$  or non-negotiable. There is a penalty on the saver withdrawing the money before the maturity date (they are term securities). CDs are normally issued in lots ranging from £50,000 to £500,000 in the UK, or $100,000 to $1 million in the US, with similar sized lots in the Eurozone and Japan.

Non-negotiable CDs must be held by the depositor until the CD reaches maturity. The advantage of negotiable CDs is that although they cannot be redeemed at the issuing bank without a penalty, they can be traded in a secondary market, so the original depositor can achieve liquidity but the bank issuing the certificate has a deposit held with it until the maturity date. The rate of interest paid on negotiable CDs is lower than a fixed deposit because of the attraction of high liquidity.

A company with surplus cash can put it into a CD knowing that if its situation changes and it needs extra cash, it can sell the CD (if negotiable) for cash. The tradable value of the CD rises according to the remaining length of its maturity. At the centre of the secondary market is a network of brokers and dealers in CDs, striking deals over the telephone.

CDs are quoted in the trading market on a yield-to-maturity basis - see Example 9.

# Example 9 CDs

A £75,000 CD is issued on 15 March for two months at 1.04 per cent (expressed as an annual rate, even though the money is deposited for a mere two months). This means that the bank will pay the following at maturity (including accumulated interest):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{Va lu e} = \text{Fa ce Va lu e} + \left(\text{Fa ce Va lu e} \times \frac{\text{In te re st}}{1 0 0} \times \frac{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in ye ar}}\right) \\ \text{Va lu e} = 7 5, 0 0 0 + \left(7 5, 0 0 0 \times \frac{1 . 0 4}{1 0 0} \times \frac{6 1}{3 6 5}\right) = 7 5, 1 3 0. 3 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

The CD is sold to another investor with 16 days left to maturity. Its present value (at the time of sale) if annual rates of interest on 16-day CDs are 1.04 per cent is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{Pr es en tV al ue} = \frac{\text{Va lu ea tM at ur it y}}{1 + \left(\frac{\text{In te rs t}}{1 0 0} \times \frac{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}\right)} \\ \text{Pr es en tV al ue} = \frac{7 5 , 1 3 0 . 3 6}{1 + \left(\frac{1 . 0 4}{1 0 0} \times \frac{1 6}{3 6 5}\right)} = 7 5, 0 9 6. 1 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, the second holder of the CD will pay £75,096.12 now and receive £75,130.36 from the bank if they hold for another 16 days.

The yield to maturity of this CD held for 16 days is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Y i e l d \text{to} M a t u r i t y = \frac{\text{Va lu ea tM at ur it y -P re se nt Va lu e}}{\text{Pr es en tV al ue}} \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \times 1 0 0 \\ \text{YieldtoMaturityexpressedasanannualrate} = \frac{75,130.36 - 75,096.12}{75,096.12} \times \frac{365}{16} \times 100 = 1.04 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

As well as domestic currency CDs there are Eurocurrency (Eurodollar) certificates of deposit. Standard Eurocurrency deposits (not CDs) have fixed maturities - say seven days, and you cannot get at that money until the seven days have passed. By issuing Eurodollar CDs banks are able to offer an improvement if those CDs are negotiable, by allowing depositors to sell the CDs to other investors before maturity.

# Bills of exchange/banker's acceptances

Bills of exchange and banker's acceptances are instruments that are particularly useful in helping to oil the wheels of international commerce. They enable corporations to obtain credit or to raise money, and also to trade with foreign corporations at low risk of financial inconvenience or loss. An illustration of the problem is provided in Example 10.

# Example 10 The international trade problem

Tractors UK has found a firm in South Africa which wishes to buy £2 million worth of its tractors. Tractors UK cannot simply send its tractors to South Africa in the hope that the payment will be sent, nor can the South African firm send money in the hope that the tractors will be sent. The two companies do not know each other well enough to trust that the transaction will be carried out correctly on each side. The solution is to use a bill of exchange or a banker's acceptance, which will provide a legally enforceable promise of payment of £2 million to Tractors UK, which can send the tractors off to South Africa, knowing with a high degree of certainty that payment will be made.

# Bills of exchange

Bills of exchange have been used to smooth the progress of overseas trade for a long time. Known to have been used by the Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, the bill of exchange appeared in its present form during the thirteenth century among the Lombards of northern Italy who engaged in widespread foreign trading. These instruments became particularly useful in the burgeoning international trade of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The seller of goods to be exported to a buyer in another country frequently grants the customer a number of months in which to pay. The seller will draw up a bill of exchange (also called a trade bill). This is a legal document showing the indebtedness of the buyer. The bill of exchange is then forwarded to and accepted by the customer, which means that the customer signs a promise to pay the stated amount and currency on the due date. The due date is usually 90 days later, but 30-, 60or 180-days bills of exchange are not uncommon.

The bill is returned to the seller who then has a choice: either to hold it until maturity, or to sell it at a discount to a bank or discount house. Under the second option the purchaser, called a discounter, will pay a lower amount than the sum to be received in, say, 90 days from the customer. The difference represents the discounter's interest payment.

Bills of exchange are normally used only for transactions greater than £75,000. The effective interest rate charged by the discounter is usually a competitive 150–400 basis points over interbank lending rates (for example, LIBOR) depending on the creditworthiness of the seller and the customer. The bank that purchased the bill in the discount market has recourse to both of the commercial companies: if the customer does not pay then the seller will be called upon to make good the debt. This overhanging credit risk can sometimes be dealt with by the selling company obtaining credit insurance. Despite the simplification of Exhibit 5.12, many bills of exchange do not remain in the hands of the discounter until maturity but are traded in an active secondary market (the money market). Note also that not all bills of exchange are a form of temporary finance. Some are 'sight drafts', that is, payable on demand immediately.

# Banker's acceptances

A banker's acceptance, also known as an acceptance credit, is a time draft, which is a document stating the signatory will pay an amount at a future date. Say, for example, that an importer has agreed to buy goods from an exporter with an agreement to pay in three months. The exporter could be instructed to send the document which states that the signatory will pay a sum of money at a set date in the future to the importer's bank. This is 'accepted' by the importer's bank rather than by a customer. (Simultaneously the importer makes a commitment to pay the accepting bank the relevant sum at the maturity date of the bill.)

Exhibit 5.12 Bill of exchange sequence

# Example 11 Bill of exchange

A customer has accepted a bill of exchange which commits it to pay £300,000 in 90 days. The bill is sold by the supplier immediately to a discount house or bank for £297,000. After 90 days the discounter will realise a profit of £3,000 on a £297,000 asset. To calculate the effective rate of interest:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{In te re st} = \frac{\text{Di sc ou nt}}{\text{Di sc ou nt ed Pr ic e}} \times 1 0 0 \\ \text{Interest} = \frac{3000}{297,000} \times 100 = 1.0101 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

To calculate the annual rate of interest, the bond equivalent yield, bey, this equates to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{be y} = \frac{\text{Di sc ou nt}}{\text{Di sc ou nt ed Pr ic e}} \times 1 0 0 \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}} \\ \mathrm{bey} = \frac{3000}{297,000}\times 100\times \frac{365}{90} = 4.0965\% \\ \end{array}
$$

Through this arrangement the customer has the benefit of the goods on 90 days' credit, the supplier has made a sale and immediately receives cash from the discount house amounting to 99 per cent of the total due, and the discounter, if it can borrow its funds at less than 1.01 per cent over 90 days, turns in a healthy profit.

This bank commitment to pay the holder of the acceptance credit allows it to be sold with more credibility in the money markets to, say, another bank (a discounter) by the exporter after receiving it from an importing company's bank.

Not all banker's acceptances relate to overseas trade. Many are simply a way of raising money for a firm. The company in need of finance may simply ask its bank to create a banker's acceptance and hand it over. Then the company can sell it in the discount market at a time when it needs to raise some cash.

While banker's acceptances are similar to bills of exchange between a seller and a buyer, they have the advantage that the organisation promising to pay is a reputable bank representing a lower credit risk to any subsequent discounter, thus they normally attract finer discount rates than bills of exchange. The holder of the instrument has two guarantors: first the importer and second the bank.

When the maturity date is reached the company (e.g. importer) pays its bank the value of the bill and the bank pays the ultimate holder of the bill its face value. They are very useful for companies expanding into new markets where their name is not known, and therefore their creditworthiness is also unknown; they can take advantage of the superior creditworthiness of the bank issuing the acceptance, which guarantees that payment will be made.

There are two costs involved:

1 The bank charges acceptance commission for adding its name to the acceptance.

2 The difference between the face value of the acceptance and the discount price, which is the effective interest rate. (Also, dealers take a small cut as they connect firms that want to sell with companies that wish to invest in banker's acceptances.)

These costs are relatively low compared with overdraft costs. However, this facility is available only in hundreds of thousands of pounds, euros, etc. and then only to the most creditworthy of companies. Exhibit 5.13 summarises the acceptance credit sequence for an export deal.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/cb3ea197bb5477ab0e3b4279e14585d81ce99e5acf3a2da173e4a84d3a9b7a45.jpg)

Exhibit 5.13 Banker's acceptance sequence – for an export deal

1 Banker's acceptance drafted and sent by an exporting company (or its bank) demanding payment for goods sent to an importer's bank. Importer makes arrangements with its bank to help it. Acceptance commission paid to the bank by importer.

2 The bank accepts the promise to pay a sum at a stated future date.

3 The banker's acceptance is sold at a discount.

4 The discounter pays cash for the banker's acceptance.

5 The bank pays the final holder of the banker's acceptance the due sum.

6 The importer pays to the bank the banker's acceptance due sum.

# Example 12 The use of a banker's acceptance

A Dutch company buys €3.5 million of goods from a firm in Japan and draws up a document promising to pay for the goods in 60 days' time. The Dutch company asks its bank to accept the document. Once the bank has stamped 'accepted' on the document, it becomes a negotiable (sellable) instrument. The exporter receives the banker's acceptance. After 15 days, the Japanese company decides it needs some extra short-term finance and sells the acceptance at a discount of 0.60 per cent. To calculate how much (the selling price) it receives:

Selling Price = Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Percentage)

Selling Price = 3,500,000 -  $(3,500,000 \times \frac{0.60}{100}) = \in \mathbb{E}3,479,000$ , a discount of  $\in \mathbb{E}21,000$

To calculate the annual rate of interest, the bond equivalent yield, bey, which this is costing them:

$$
\mathrm{be y} = \frac{\text{Di sc ou nt}}{\text{Di sc ou nt ed Pr ic e}} \times 1 0 0 \times \frac{\text{Da ys in Ye ar}}{\text{Da ys to Ma tu ri ty}}
$$

$$
\mathrm{bey} = \frac{21,000}{3,479,000}\times 100\times \frac{365}{45} = 4.896\%
$$

The exporter has been paid by banker's acceptance immediately the goods are despatched. It can also shield itself from the risk of exchange rates shifting over the next 60 days by discounting the acceptance immediately, receiving euros and then converting these to yen. And, of course, the exporter is not exposed to the credit risk of the importer because it has the guarantee from the importer's bank.

# Money market interest rates in the Financial Times

The Financial Times publishes a table each day showing many of the money market interest rates. See Exhibit 5.14 for a table showing rates for 15 March 2011. The  $FT$  shows a lot more information at www.ft.com/bonds&rates. The UK three-month Treasury bill rate of interest is not shown in this table. However, it is shown at the bottom of the front page of the  $FT$  every day – in a box at the bottom of the page you will find the 'UK 3 million' yield expressed as an annual rate.

Special drawing rights (SDRs) are a composite currency designed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This currency basket is currently based on four key international currencies, consisting of the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and US dollar. The SDR rate of interest is the rate charged by the IMF on loans it makes to IMF members. It is an international reserve asset to supplement its member countries' official reserves when it is felt that, with the increase in world trade, the amount of gold and US dollar reserves does not offer enough security to support this expansion.

# Comparing interest rates

Despite money market instruments having maturities of no more than one year it can be seen from the  $FT$  table in Exhibit 5.14 that they can have remarkably different interest rates depending on the length of time to maturity. For example, on 15 March 2011 a sterling interbank loan for one month cost 0.61313 per cent at an annualised rate whereas a loan of similar default risk (i.e. very low), but lasting for one year, had an annualised interest rate more than double that, at 1.57688 per cent.

These yields to maturity also vary considerably over time - see Exhibits 5.15 and 5.16, which show comparative interest rates from the UK and the US over a 30-year period. A number of observations can be made about the interest rate on different money market instruments:

- Generally, investors require extra return for longer lending periods, so overnight rates will normally be less than rates on longer-term instruments (although this is not always the case). Notice in Exhibit 5.16 US six-month T-bill rates are generally higher than those for three-month lending.
- The credit rating of the borrowing institution has a strong influence on the rate of interest charged. The rate offered by reputable national governments will usually be lower than the

rate offered by a corporation wishing to raise cash by issuing commercial paper, or by a bank issuing certificates of deposit – see Exhibits 5.15 and 5.16. However, there are some governments that are required by the financial markets to pay higher interest rates than many international corporates – e.g. Greece, Portugal and Ireland in 2011 paid more than HSBC.

- When expectations about future inflation rise, interest rates rise accordingly, which leads to a decrease in the market price of money market instruments. Conversely, when inflation expectations are lowered, interest rates fall and the market price of the instruments rises. Thus we see that interest rates across the board tend to rise and fall together over time. The high rates of interest offered in the 1980s largely reflected the high inflation of the time.
- Supply and demand – if banks need to borrow large sums of money quickly, they will sell more shorter-term instruments. This will have the effect of increasing market supply of these instruments, and therefore pushing down their price, which in turn will increase the rate of interest, the yield to maturity.
- Money market interest rates with similar terms to maturity stay close together and move up or down with quite a high degree of correlation over time. They are all low risk and all short term, thus there is a reasonable amount of substitutability between them for potential lenders. Thus, if interest rates in, say, the CD market fell significantly below that in, say, the commercial paper market, those banks needing to attract deposits might have difficulty doing so, because potential lenders will put more money in the CP market. The banks will have to raise CD interest rates to attract deposits while the commercial paper borrowers will find they can lower rates – thus some degree of convergence takes place.
- Short-term interest rates can be lowered by central banks intervening in the markets when they judge that the economy is in need of a boost. You can see this sort of action in the figures in the years after the shock of the dot.com bust at the turn of the millennium and following the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

# Concluding comments

The money markets have grown substantially over the past 30 years to trillions of dollars per year. Their growth has increased the opportunities for governments, corporations, banks and other organisations to lend and borrow. This has greatly assisted the flow of funds in the economy and reduced the cost of obtaining funds at short notice. They have also provided a source of interest for companies and other organisations with cash that can be invested only for short periods.

When making investments with surplus funds, corporations need to recognise they will have to compromise between the three objectives of investment: security, liquidity and yield. To try to achieve more yield will result in less security and/or less liquidity. Usually, for the temporary deployment of short-term surplus funds, low risk (high security) is the top priority because the preservation of capital is necessary so that the firm can meet its daily needs for working capital cash – it needs 'operating cash'. If money is lost then raising alternative funds at short notice to keep day-to-day operations running can be expensive. If the firm has more than enough near-cash to cover any likely short-term requirements then it can consider investing in longer-term instruments with reduced ability to release cash quickly and at low cost – i.e. lower liquidity – to obtain a higher yield.

As with all powerful tools, money markets can be used to destroy wealth as well as to create something positive. An example of the destructive power in the wrong hands came in the mid-2000s when many institutions were over-reliant on regularly rolling over their money market borrowing to finance investment in instruments that would not pay back for many years. Thus, in

2007-2008 banks and other institutions would borrow for, say, 60 days in the commercial paper market to buy long-term bonds whose cash flows depended on the continued monthly mortgage payments being made by thousands of households. When doubts started to emerge about households' ability or willingness to make these payments, knock-on doubts were raised about the so-called securitised bonds secured against the mortgage payments. Money market investors suddenly chose not to buy more instruments as the old ones matured and the banks and other institutions found themselves having to finance the deals. Many could not find the money and then failed. There is more on the financial crisis of 2008 in Chapter 16.

# Key points and concepts

The money markets are wholesale financial markets in which lending and borrowing on a short-term basis takes place – that is, usually for less than one year.

Most money market instruments are sold on a discount basis.

Quoted interest rates are usually on an annualised yield (bond equivalent yield).

- Many money market instruments are negotiable (can be traded in secondary markets).
- Knowing the day count convention (e.g. a 360-day year) used is important.
- Money market funds are funds set up to invest in money market instruments by pooling the savings of many people or institutions. These money market funds are administered by financial institutions which benefit from economies of scale in investing in a portfolio of money market securities.
Functions of money are:
- a means of exchange;
- a unit of account;
- a store of value.

Time value of money elements: impatience to consume;

- inflation;
- risk.

Required return (time value of money) = Risk free return + risk premium.

Real rate of interest  $=$  nominal rate of interest - inflation.

Interbank market: originally defined as the market where banks lend to each other, in both the domestic and international markets. Increasingly, as well as banks being depositors, this group includes large industrial and commercial companies, other financial institutions and international organisations.

$\bullet$  Interest rates:

- May be floating (changeable over the life of the loan) or fixed.
- Three-month LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate), set by the British Bankers' Association (BBA) is the most commonly used and important lending rate, only available to very creditworthy borrowers, other borrowers pay LIBOR plus basis points.
- BBA also sets rates for ten currencies for maturities ranging from overnight to 12 months.
- EURIBOR: rates at which banks in the Eurozone and other countries lend to each other for periods ranging from overnight to up to one year.
Federal Funds rate: US equivalent to very short-term LIBOR – lending to highly creditworthy banks overnight.
US prime rate is charged by US banks to the most creditworthy corporate customers.
- EONIA: overnight lending rate for the euro in the Eurozone.
- EURONIA: overnight lending rate for the euro in the UK.
- SONIA: actual average overnight rate for sterling.
- Eurocurrency (Eurodollars, Euroyen, etc.): money deposited or lent outside jurisdiction of country of the currency it is issued in, and so not subject to that country's regulations.
- Nothing to do with the euro.
- Four advantages for firms compared with domestic borrowing:
- lower cost of finance;
- less regulation;
- able to reduce the impact of exchange rate changes;
- able to deal in very large amounts.

Eurocredit market for medium and long-term Eurocurrency securities.

- Treasury bills are negotiable securities issued, generally at auction at a discount to their par value, by governments needing to borrow. When issued by reputable governments, they are virtually risk-free, but pay low rates of interest. They form the bulk of money market securities.
- UK Treasury bills are issued to an approved list of buyers at competitive weekly tenders by the Debt Management Office.

$$

US Treasury bills are sold by the US federal government at a discount to par in competitive or non-competitive auctions. All bidders pay the same amount.

- There is an inverse relationship between bill prices and interest rates: if interest rates rise, the purchase price of bills being traded falls, effectively increasing the yield.
- Central banks keep the wheels of the financial world moving by issuing bank notes, influencing short-term domestic interest rates and evening-out liquidity in the economy by buying and selling securities.
- Commercial paper is an unsecured short-term debt instrument, used mainly by corporations to raise finance:
- the normal maturity range is between 30 and 90 days and it is issued at a discount to par.
- this facility is available only to corporations with a high credit rating.
- commercial paper programme is a revolving underwriting facility set up by a bank, whereby corporations can draw up to a specified maximum sum for between five and seven years. Multi-currency programme allows the issuer to choose the currency of issue.
- asset-backed commercial paper: secured on receivable income or other assets.
- Eurocommercial paper (Euro-CP) is CP issued and placed outside the jurisdiction of the country of its denomination.
- Credit ratings are given to CP and other securities by three main credit ratings agencies, Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings, who each use slightly different terminology. A credit rating rates the ability of the CP issuer to repay its debt and influences the rate of interest charged. An investment rating is important because institutional investors can often only invest in these grades.
- Repurchase agreements (repo) are short-term loans secured by safe securities, which ensures low interest rates. The securities are sold with an agreement to buy them back at a set price on a set date. The term is usually between one and 14 days, but can be up to a year. An open repo has no end date. A reverse repo is an agreement to first buy and then sell back securities to a counterparty at a set price on a set date. To calculate the buy back price on a repo:

Buy Back Price = Selling Price + (Selling Price × Interest Rate ×  $\frac{\text{DaystoMaturity}}{\text{DaysinYear}}$ )

- a haircut protects the buyer from price fluctuations. The seller receives the amount of cash required less a margin, the haircut, and pays interest on the principal less the haircut. The calculation is:

Buy Back Price = Selling Price +  $\left[\left(Selling\ Price-Haircut\right) \times \text{ InterestRate} \times \frac{\text{ DaystoMaturity }}{\text{ DaysinYear }}\right]$

- Local authority/municipal bills are issued to finance some expenditure by local government and associated agencies. They are prevalent in the US (where they are free of some taxes) and Continental Europe.
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are issued by banks when funds are deposited with them. They state that a deposit has been made and that at maturity the bank will pay a (increased) sum to the holder. Their maturity can be up to a year but is typically one to four months.

Value of CD at Maturity = Face Value + (Face Value × Interest / 100 × Days to Maturity / Days in Year)

Present Value of a CD =  $\frac{\text{ ValueatMaturity }}{1 + \left(\frac{\text{ Interest }}{100} \times \frac{\text{ DaystoMaturity }}{\text{ DaysinYear }}\right)}$

Yield to Maturity of a CD =  $\frac{\text{ValueatMaturity -PresentValue}}{\text{PresentValue}} \times \frac{\text{DaysinYear}}{\text{DaystoMaturity}} \times 100$

- Bill of exchange: the acknowledgement of a debt to be paid at a specified time. The legal right to receive this debt can be sold prior to maturity, that is, discounted, and thus can provide a source of finance.
- Interest on a discounted bill of exchange  $= \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{DiscountedPrice}} \times 100$
Bond equivalent yield, bey, on a bill of exchange  $= \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{DiscountedPrice}} \times 100 \times \frac{\text{DaysinYear}}{\text{DaystoMaturity}}$
- Acceptance credit: a financial institution or other reputable organisation accepts the promise to pay a specified sum in the future to a firm. The firm can pass on this right to a supplier or sell this right, that is discount it, to receive cash from another institution.

Selling price of an acceptance credit  $=$  Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Percentage)

Acceptance credit bond equivalent yield, bey  $= \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{DiscountedPrice}} \times 100 \times \frac{\text{DaysinYear}}{\text{DaystoMaturity}}$

# Appendix 5.1 Converting from a 365-day basis to a 360-day basis

To compare interest rates calculated with different day-count conventions we need to convert all rates to a common basis. This can be done using the following formula:

$$
\text{In te rs tr at eo nc om pa ri so nb as is} = \text{in te rs tr at eo nq uo te db as is} \left(\frac{\text{nu mb er of da ys in co mp ar is on}}{\text{nu mb er of da ys in qu ot ed ye ar}}\right)
$$

If you wanted to compare a 5.5 per cent interest quoted on a 365-day year basis with another instrument calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, the calculation would be:

$$
\text{Comparisoninterestrate} = 5.5 \times \left(\frac{360}{365}\right) = 5.42 \%
$$

So the rate prepared on a 360-day convention is stated at 5.42 per cent, but the effective rate of interest for the year is 5.5 per cent.

The rates prepared on a 360-day basis are lower than those on a 365-day basis.

# Appendix 5.2 Mathematical tools for finance

The purpose of this appendix is to explain essential mathematical skills that will be needed for this book. The author has no love of mathematics for its own sake and so only those techniques of direct relevance to the subject matter of this textbook will be covered in this section.

# Simple and compound interest

When there are time delays between receipts and payments of financial sums we need to make use of the concepts of simple and compound interest.

# Simple interest

Interest is paid only on the original principal. No interest is paid on the accumulated interest payments.

# Example 1

Suppose that a sum of £10 is deposited in a bank account that pays 12 per cent per annum. At the end of year 1 the investor has £11.20 in the account. That is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} F = P (1 + i) \\ 1 1. 2 0 = 1 0 (1 + 0. 1 2) \\ \end{array}
$$ where  $F =$  future value,  $P =$  present value,  $i =$  interest rate.


The initial sum, called the principal, is multiplied by the interest rate to give the annual return. At the end of five years:

$$

F = P (1 + i n)

$$ where  $n =$  number of years. Thus,

$$
1 6 = 1 0 (1 + (0. 1 2 \times 5))
$$

Note from the example that the 12 per cent return is a constant amount each year. Interest is not earned on the interest already accumulated from previous years.

# Compound interest

The more usual situation in the real world is for interest to be paid on the sum which accumulates – whether or not that sum comes from the principal or from the interest received in previous periods.

# Example 2

An investment of £10 is made at an interest rate of 12 per cent with the interest being compounded. In one year the capital will grow by 12 per cent to £11.20. In the second year the capital will grow by 12 per cent, but this time the growth will be on the accumulated value of £11.20 and thus will amount to an extra £1.34. At the end of two years:

$$
\begin{array}{l} F = P (1 + i) (1 + i) \\ F = 1 1. 2 0 (1 + i) \\ F = 1 2. 5 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

Alternatively,

$$
F = P (1 + i)^{2}
$$

Exhibit 5.17 displays the future value of £1 invested at a number of different interest rates and for alternative numbers of years. This is extracted from Appendix I at the end of the book.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Year</td><td colspan="5">Interest rate (per cent per annum)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>1.0100</td><td>1.0200</td><td>1.0500</td><td>1.1200</td><td>1.1500</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td>1.0201</td><td>1.0404</td><td>1.1025</td><td>1.2544</td><td>1.3225</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td>1.0303</td><td>1.0612</td><td>1.1576</td><td>1.4049</td><td>1.5209</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td>1.0406</td><td>1.0824</td><td>1.2155</td><td>1.5735</td><td>1.7490</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td>1.0510</td><td>1.1041</td><td>1.2763</td><td>1.7623</td><td>2.0114</td></tr></table>

From the second row of the table in Exhibit 5.17 we can read that £1 invested for two years at 12 per cent amounts to £1.2544. Thus, the investment of £10 provides a future capital sum 1.2544 times the original amount:

$$
£ 1 0 \times 1. 2 5 4 4 = £ 1 2. 5 4 4
$$

Over five years the result is:

$$
F = P (1 + \mathrm{i})^{n}
$$

$$
1 7. 6 2 = 1 0 (1 + 0. 1 2)^{5}
$$

The interest on the accumulated interest is therefore the difference between the total arising from simple interest and that from compound interest:

$$
£ 1 7. 6 2 - £ 1 6. 0 0 = £ 1. 6 2
$$

Almost all investments pay compound interest and so we will be using compounding throughout the book.

# Present values

There are many occasions in financial management when you are given the future sums and need to find out what those future sums are worth in present-value terms today. For example, you wish to know how much you would have to put aside today which will accumulate, with compounded interest, to a defined sum in the future; or you are given the choice between receiving £200 in five years or £100 now and wish to know which is the better option, given anticipated interest rates; or a project gives a return of £1 million in three years for an outlay of £800,000 now and you need to establish whether this is the best use of the £800,000. By the process of discounting, a sum of money to be received in the future is given a monetary value today.

# Example 3

If we anticipate the receipt of £17.62 in five years' time we can determine its present value. Rearrangement of the compound formula, and assuming a discount rate of 12 per cent, gives:

$$
\begin{array}{l} P = \frac{F}{(1 + i)^{n}} o r P = F \times \frac{1}{(1 + i)^{n}} \\ 1 0 = \frac{1 7 . 6 2}{\left(1 + 0 . 1 2\right)^{5}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Alternatively, discount factors may be used, as shown in Exhibit 5.18 (this is an extract from Appendix II at the end of the book). The factor needed to discount £1 receivable in five years when the discount rate is 12 per cent is 0.5674.

Therefore the present value of £17.62 is:

$$
0. 5 6 7 4 \times £ 1 7. 6 2 = £ 1 0
$$

Exhibit 5.18 The present value of £1

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Year</td><td colspan="5">Interest rate (per cent per annum)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>0.9901</td><td>0.9524</td><td>0.9091</td><td>0.8929</td><td>0.8696</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td>0.9803</td><td>0.9070</td><td>0.8264</td><td>0.7972</td><td>0.7561</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td>0.9706</td><td>0.8638</td><td>0.7513</td><td>0.7118</td><td>0.6575</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td>0.9610</td><td>0.8227</td><td>0.6830</td><td>0.6355</td><td>0.5718</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td>0.9515</td><td>0.7835</td><td>0.6209</td><td>0.5674</td><td>0.4972</td></tr></table>

Examining the present value table in Exhibit 5.18 you can see that as the discount rate increases, the present value goes down. Also, the further into the future the money is to be received, the less valuable it is in today's terms. Distant cash flows discounted at a high rate have a small present value; for instance, £1,000 receivable in 20 years when the discount rate is 17 per cent has a present value of £43.30. Viewed from another angle, if you invested £43.30 for 20 years it would accumulate to £1,000 if interest compounds at 17 per cent.

# Determining the rate of interest

Sometimes you wish to calculate the rate of return that a project is earning. For instance, a savings company may offer to pay you £10,000 in five years if you deposit £8,000 now, when interest rates on accounts elsewhere are offering 6 per cent per annum. In order to make a comparison you need to know the annual rate being offered by the savings company. Thus, we need to find  $i$  in the discounting equation.

To be able to calculate  $i$  it is necessary to rearrange the compounding formula. Since:

$$
F = P (1 + i)^{n}
$$ first, divide both sides by  $P$ :


$$

F / P = (1 + i)^{n}

$$

(The  $P_{s}$  on the right side cancel out.)

Second, take the root to the power  $n$  of both sides and subtract 1 from each side:

$$ i = \sqrt [ n ]{\frac{F}{P}} - 1 o r i = \left[ \frac{F}{P} \right]^{1 / n} - 1
$$

# Example 4

In the case of a five-year investment requiring an outlay of £10 and having a future value of £17.62 the rate of return is:

$$ i = \sqrt [ 5 ]{\frac{17.62}{10}} - 1 = 12 \%
$$

$$ i = \left[\frac{17.62}{10}\right]^{1 / 5} - 1 = 12\%
$$

# Technical aside

You can use the  $\sqrt[x]{y}$ , the  $\sqrt[y]{x}$  button or a combination of the  $y^x$  and  $\frac{1}{x}$  buttons depending on the calculator.

Alternatively, use the future value table (Appendix I), an extract of which is shown in Exhibit 5.17. In our example, the return on £1 worth of investment over five years is:

$$
\frac{1 7 . 6 2}{1 0} = 1. 7 6 2
$$

In the body of the future value table look at the year 5 row for a future value of 1.762.

Read off the interest rate of 12 per cent.

An interesting application of this technique outside finance is to use it to put into perspective the pronouncements of politicians. For example, in 1994 John Major made a speech to the Conservative Party conference promising to double national income (the total quantity of goods and services produced) within 25 years. This sounds impressive, but let us see how ambitious this is in terms of an annual percentage increase.

$$ i = \sqrt [ 2 5 ]{\frac{F}{P}} - 1
$$

$F$ , future income, is double  $P$ , the present income.

$$ i = \sqrt [ 2 5 ]{\frac{2}{1}} - 1 = 0. 0 2 8 1 \text{or} 2. 8 1
$$

The result is not too bad compared with the previous 20 years. However, performance in the 1950s and 1960s was better and countries in the Far East have annual rates of growth of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.

# The investment period

Rearranging the standard equation so that we can find  $n$  (the number of years of the investment), we create the following equation:

$$
F = P (1 + i)^{n}
$$

$$
F / P = (1 + i)^{n}
$$

$$
\log (F / P) = \log (1 + i) n
$$

$$ n = \frac{\log (F / P)}{\log (1 + i)}
$$

# Example 5

How many years does it take for £10 to grow to £17.62 when the interest rate is 12 per cent?

$$ n = \frac{\log (1 7 . 6 2 / 1 0)}{\log (1 + 0 . 1 2)} \text{Th er ef or e} n = 5 \text{ye ar s}
$$

An application outside finance: how many years will it take for China to double its real national income if growth rates continue at 10 per cent per annum?

Answer:

$$ n = \frac{\log (2 / 1)}{\log (1 + 0 . 1)} = 7. 3 \text{ye ar s (qu ad ru pl in gi nl es st ha n1 5y ea rs .A t} \text{th is ra te it wo n ＂t he lo ng be fo re}
$$

# Annuities

Quite often there is not just one payment at the end of a certain number of years, there can be a series of identical payments made over a period of years. For instance:

- bonds usually pay a regular rate of interest;
- individuals can buy, from savings plan companies, the right to receive a number of identical payments over a number of years;
- a business might invest in a project which, it is estimated, will give regular cash inflows over a period of years; a typical house mortgage is an annuity.

An annuity is a series of payments or receipts of equal amounts. We are able to calculate the present value of this set of payments.

# Example 6

For a regular payment of £10 per year for five years, when the interest rate is 12 per cent, we can calculate the present value of the annuity by three methods.

# Method 1

$$
P_{a n} = \frac{A}{(1 + i)} + \frac{A}{(1 + i)^{2}} + \frac{A}{(1 + i)^{3}} + \frac{A}{(1 + i)^{4}} + \frac{A}{(1 + i)^{5}}
$$ where  $A =$  the periodic receipt.


$$

P_{1 0. 5} = \frac{1 0}{(1 . 1 2)} + \frac{1 0}{(1 . 1 2)^{2}} + \frac{1 0}{(1 . 1 2)^{3}} + \frac{1 0}{(1 . 1 2)^{4}} + \frac{1 0}{(1 . 1 2)^{5}} = £ 3 6. 0 5

$$

# Method 2

Using the derived formula:

$$

P_{a n} = \frac{1 - 1 / (1 + i)^{n}}{i} \times A

$$

$$

P_{1 0. 5} = \frac{1 - 1 / (1 + 0 . 1 2)^{5}}{0 . 1 2} \times 1 0 = £ 3 6. 0 5

$$

# Method 3

Use the 'present value of an annuity' table. (See Exhibit 5.19, an extract from the more complete annuity table at the end of the book in Appendix III.) Here we simply look along the year 5 row and 12 per cent column to find the figure of 3.605. This refers to the present value of five annual receipts of £1. So to arrive at £3.605 (or £3.6048 to be even more accurate) someone calculated the present value of £1 received in one year, the present value of £1 received at the end of two years, and so on up to five years. Then these five present values are added together.

For our example we are not anticipating £1 for each future year but £10. Therefore we multiply the annuity factor by £10:

$$
3. 6 0 5 \times £ 1 0 = £ 3 6. 0 5
$$

Exhibit 5.19 The present value of an annuity of £1 per annum

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Year</td><td colspan="5">Interest rate (per cent per annum)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.9901</td><td>0.9524</td><td>0.9091</td><td>0.8929</td><td>0.8696</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1.9704</td><td>1.8594</td><td>1.7355</td><td>1.6901</td><td>1.6257</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2.9410</td><td>2.7232</td><td>2.4869</td><td>2.4018</td><td>2.2832</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3.9020</td><td>3.5459</td><td>3.1699</td><td>3.0373</td><td>2.8550</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4.8535</td><td>4.3295</td><td>3.7908</td><td>3.6048</td><td>3.3522</td></tr></table>

The student is strongly advised against using Method 1. This was presented for conceptual understanding only. For any but the simplest cases, this method can be very time consuming.

# Perpetuities

Some contracts run indefinitely and there is no end to a series of identical payments. Perpetuities are rare in the private sector, but certain government securities do not have an end date; that is, the amount paid or the par value when the bond was purchased by the lender will never be repaid, only interest payments are made. For example, the UK government has issued consolidated stocks or war loans which will never be redeemed. Also, in a number of financial valuations it is useful to assume that regular annual payments go on for ever. Perpetuities are annuities which continue indefinitely. The value of a perpetuity is simply the annual amount received divided by the interest rate when the latter is expressed as a decimal.

$$

P = \frac{A}{i}

$$

If £10 is to be received as an indefinite annual payment then the present value, at a discount rate of 12 per cent, is:

$$

P = \frac{1 0}{0 . 1 2} = £ 8 3. 3 3

$$

It is very important to note that in order to use this formula we are assuming that the first payment arises 365 days after the time at which we are standing (the present time or time zero).

# Discounting semi-annually, monthly and daily

Sometimes financial transactions take place on the basis that interest will be calculated more frequently than once a year. For instance, if a bank account paid 12 per cent nominal return per year but credited 6 per cent after half a year, in the second half of the year interest could be earned on the interest credited after the first six months. This will mean that the true annual rate of interest will be greater than 12 per cent.

The greater the frequency with which interest is earned, the higher the future value of the deposit.

# Example 7

If you put £10 in a bank account earning 12 per cent per annum then your return after one year is:

$$

1 0 (1 + 0. 1 2) = £ 1 1. 2 0

$$

If the interest is compounded semi-annually (at a nominal annual rate of 12 per cent):

$$

1 0 (1 + [ 0. 1 2 / 2 ]) (1 + [ 0. 1 2 / 2 ]) = 1 0 (1 + [ 0. 1 2 / 2 ])^{2} = £ 1 1. 2 3 6

$$

In Example 7 the difference between annual compounding and semi-annual compounding is an extra  $3.6\mathrm{p}$ . After six months the bank credits the account with  $60\mathrm{p}$  in interest so that in the following six months the investor earns 6 per cent on the  $\mathbb{E}10.60$

If the interest is compounded quarterly:

$$

1 0 (1 + [ 0. 1 2 / 4 ])^{4} = £ 1 1. 2 5 5

$$

Daily compounding:

$$

1 0 (1 + [ 0. 1 2 / 3 6 5 ])^{3 6 5} = £ 1 1. 2 7 4 7

$$

# Example 8

If £10 is deposited in a bank account that compounds interest quarterly and the nominal return per year is 12 per cent, how much will be in the account after eight years?

$$

1 0 (1 + [ 0. 1 2 / 4 ])^{4 \times 8} = £ 2 5. 7 5

$$

# Continuous compounding

If the compounding frequency is taken to the limit we say that there is continuous compounding. When the number of compounding periods approaches infinity, the future value is found by  $F = Pe^{\mathrm{in}}$  where  $e$  is the value of the exponential function. This is set as 2.71828 (to five decimal places, as shown on a scientific calculator).

So, the future value of £10 deposited in a bank paying 12 per cent nominal compounded continuously after eight years is:

$$

1 0 \times 2. 7 1 8 2 8^{0. 1 2 \times 8} = £ 2 6. 1 2

$$

# Converting monthly and daily rates to annual rates

Sometimes you are presented with a monthly or daily rate of interest and wish to know what that is equivalent to in terms of annual percentage rate (APR) (or Effective Annual Rate (EAR)).

If  $m$  is the monthly interest or discount rate, then over 12 months:

$$

(1 + m)^{1 2} = 1 + i

$$ where  $i$  is the annual compound rate.

$$ i = (1 + m)^{1 2} - 1
$$

Thus, if a credit card company charges 1.5 per cent per month, the APR is:

$$ i = (1 + 0.015)^{12} - 1 = 19.56 \%
$$

If you want to find the monthly rate when you are given the APR:

$$
\begin{array}{l} m = (1 + i)^{1 / 1 2} - 1 \text{or} m = \sqrt [ 1 2 ]{(1 + i)} - 1 \\ m = (1 + 0.1956)^{1 / 12} - 1 \times 100 \text{or} m = \sqrt [ 1 2 ]{(1 + 0 . 1 9 5 6)} - 1 = 1.5 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

Daily rate:

$$
(1 + d)^{3 6 5} = 1 + i
$$ where  $d$  is the daily discount rate.
