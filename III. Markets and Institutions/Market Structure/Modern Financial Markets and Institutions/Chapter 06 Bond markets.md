# Bond markets

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

An understanding of the key characteristics of the main categories of bond finance is essential to anyone working in the financial sector or making financing decisions for the commercial firm. At the end of this chapter the reader should be able to: explain the nature and the main types of bonds, their pricing and their valuation;

give a considered view of the role of high-yield bonds, convertible bonds, medium-term notes, securitisation and Islamic bonds;

■ demonstrate an understanding of the usefulness of the international bond markets; describe the main elements influencing the demand and supply of bonds;

calculate the value of a bond and discuss relative bond price volatility; explain the term structure of interest rates and the reasons for its existence.

The bond markets are concerned with loans for periods of more than one year in contrast with the money markets, where loans are for a few days, weeks or months. The concept of governments, companies and other institutions borrowing funds to invest in long-term capital projects and operations is a straightforward one, yet in the sophisticated capital markets of today with their wide variety of financial instruments and forms of debt, the borrowing and lending decision can be bewildering. Is the domestic bond market or the Eurobond market the better choice? If so, on what terms, fixedor floating-rate interest, with collateral or unsecured? And what about high-yield bonds or convertibles? The variety of methods of providing long-term finance is infinite. This chapter will outline the major categories and illustrate some of the fundamental issues to be considered by a borrower and a lender.

As you can see from the extract from the annual accounts of the giant drinks company Diageo (Exhibit 6.1) a firm may need knowledge and understanding of a great many different debt instruments. The terms loan debentures and medium-term notes, mentioned in the extract, are explained in the chapter.

# Bonds

A bond is a long-term contract in which the bond holder lends money to a company, government or some other organisation. In return the company or government, etc. promises to make predetermined payments (usually regular) in the future which may consist of interest and a capital sum at the end of the bond's life. Basically, bonds may be regarded as merely IOUs with pages of legal clauses expressing the promises made. Most offer both regular interest and a capital sum to be paid on a fixed date in the future, but some do not promise a capital repayment, they just keep paying interest in perpetuity. Others do not offer regular interest, just a lump sum at the end of a period of time. They are the most significant financial instruments in the world today with more than  $90,000,000,000,000 ($ 90 trillion) in issue. They come in all shapes and sizes, from UK government bonds to Chinese company bonds.

The time to maturity for bonds is generally between 5 and 30 years, although a number of firms have issued bonds with a longer maturity date. IBM and Reliance of India have issued 100-year bonds, as have Coca-Cola and Walt Disney (Disney's was known as the 'Sleeping Beauty bond'). There are even some 1,000-year bonds in existence – Canadian Pacific Corporation is paying a dividend of 4 per cent on a 1,000-year bond issued in 1883.

# Bonds and equity compared

The advantage of placing your money with an organisation via a bond is that you are promised a return. Bond investors are exposed to less risk than share investors because the promise is backed up with a series of legal rights, e.g. the right to receive the annual interest before the equity holders receive any dividend. So in a bad year (e.g. no profits) the bond investors are far more likely to receive a payout than the shareholders. This is usually bolstered with rights to seize company assets if the company reneges on its promise. There is a greater chance of saving the investor's investment if things go very badly for the firm if they are holding its bonds rather than its shares because on liquidation the holders of debt-type financial securities are paid from the proceeds raised by selling off the assets first, before shareholders receive anything.

Offsetting these plus points are the facts that bondholders do not (usually) share in the increase in value created by an extraordinarily successful business and there is an absence of any voting power over the management of the company.

Bonds are often referred to collectively as fixed-interest securities. While this is an accurate description for many bonds, others do not offer regular interest payments that are fixed amounts. Nevertheless, they are all lumped together as fixed-interest to contrast these types of loan instrument with equities (shares) that do not carry a promise of a return.

# A wide variety

There are many different types of bonds: government-issued bonds, corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, municipal bonds, convertible bonds, strip bonds, foreign bonds, mortgage/asset-based bonds, covered bonds, Eurobonds and medium-term notes. Bonds with up to five years left until they mature and pay their principal amount are generally known as shorts, but the boundary lines are often blurry; medium-dated bonds generally have maturities of between 5 and 15 years; longs are bonds with maturities of over 15 years. It should be noted that a bond is classified according to the time remaining to maturity, not the maturity when it was issued, so a 30-year bond which has only two years left until it matures is a short.

The value of a bond may fluctuate considerably during its life and this value reflects the changes in the interest rate. A bond issued with a coupon of 5 per cent will see its value drop if the interest rate rises to 10 per cent. To put it simply – if a five-year £100 bond is issued with a coupon of 5 per cent and market interest rates for bonds with similar risk remain at 5 per cent for the five-year life of the bond, its value will remain at £100 throughout its life. If, however, interest rates on alternative equally risky bonds rise to 10 per cent when the bond has three years to matu rity, its value then will drop to £87.566 to compensate for the change in interest rate – the method for calculating this is explained later in the chapter.

# The size of the bond markets

The volume of bonds issued throughout the world is vast: \$91 trillion at the end of 2009 according to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) – see Exhibits 6.2 (a), (b) and (c). There were over \$64 trillion (million million) bonds outstanding (not yet redeemed – the capital has not been paid off) in the domestic bond markets of countries. In addition to these domestic bonds there were another 27 trillion of bonds issued outside the domestic markets on the international bond markets. To put these numbers in perspective the annual output (GDP) of the UK for one year is about £1.4 trillion.

# Government bond markets

Most governments issue bonds to raise money when their tax receipts are less than their expenditure. We first look at the UK government bond market to get a feel for the workings of these markets, then briefly consider the US, French, German, Japanese and Chinese government bond markets, known as sovereign bond markets. Sovereign bonds issued by reputable governments are the most secure in the world. National governments are aware of the need to maintain a high reputation for paying their debts on time. Furthermore, they are able to print more money or to raise taxes, to ensure they have the means to pay (in worst cases).

# UK gilts

In most years the British government does not raise enough in taxes to cover its expenditure. It makes up a large part of the difference by selling bonds. These are called gilts because in the old days you would receive a very attractive certificate with gold-leaf edges (gilt-edged securities). Buying UK government bonds is one of the safest forms of lending in the world; the risk of the UK government failing to pay is very small – although a few doubts crept in following the high government spending during 2010–2011.

While the risk of non-receipt of interest and capital is minute if you buy and hold gilts to the maturity date, you can lose money buying and selling gilts from year to year (or month to month) in the secondary market before they mature. There have been many occasions when, if you purchased at the start of the year and sold to another investor in the secondary market at the end of the year, even after receiving interest, you would have lost 5 per cent or more. Yet there were many years when you would have made large gains.

The UK government issues gilts via the UK Debt Management Office. On 23 March 2011, the total amount of gilts in issue was £1032.91 billion. This was rising at a rapid rate as the UK government spent around £160 billion more than it raised in taxes – approximately 12 per cent of gross national product, so one in every eight pounds spent was borrowed by the government!

Gilts are sold with a nominal (face or par or maturity) value of  \$100. This is not necessarily what you would pay. The nominal value signifies what the government will pay you (the bond holder) when the bond reaches its maturity or redemption date at the end of, say, 5, 10 or 25 years. You might pay$ 100, $99, \$100.50, or some other sum for it, depending on the coupon offered and the general level of interest rates in the markets.

The coupon (sometimes called the dividend) is the stated annual rate of return on the nominal value of the bond. It is a percentage figure shown immediately after the name of each gilt. So, for example, the 'Treasury 4.5pc '42' pays out £4.50 each year for every £100 nominal. Then in the year 2042 the nominal value of £100 is paid to the holder when the gilt is redeemed. The coupons are paid twice yearly in two equal instalments (£2.25 each) on set dates.

The names assigned to gilts (also called stocks), such as Exchequer, Treasury or Funding, are useful for distinguishing one from another but have no particular significance beyond that. What is more important is whether they are dated, undated or conversion. Dated gilts have a fixed date(s) at which they will be redeemed. Some have a range of dates, e.g. Exchequer 12pc, '13 – '17. This gilt will not be redeemed before the first date, 2013, and it must be redeemed before the second, 2017. Between these dates the government has the option of when to redeem. Until it is redeemed, £12 will be paid each year in coupons. A few undated gilts exist, such as War loan  $3 \frac{1}{2}$  pc, which may never be redeemed. They can be redeemed at the discretion of the government, but this is unlikely given the low coupon the government pays – it can go on paying £3.50 per year to the holder(s) of these bonds for ever. Conversion gilts allow the investor to choose whether to convert a gilt to another more attractive one. Exhibit 6.3 discusses an unusually long dated gilt. Note that even though the gilt pays 4 per cent per year on the nominal value, i.e. it pays £4 per year, it gives an interest rate of 4.569 per cent. Thus we conclude that it was sold for less than £100.

# Exhibit 6.3

# Britain draws strong demand for 50-year gilt

David Oakley

Britain drew strong demand for an ultra-long bond yesterday in a sign that new issuance of gilts has not been hit by the turbulence surrounding Greece and the peripheral eurozone economies.

The sale of 4.5 billion of the UK's 4 per cent 2060 gilt was placed almost exclusively with domestic investors as pension funds and life insurance companies, need ing these bonds to match their liabilities, bought the debt. Order books reached  $\S 7.5$  billion.

Bankers priced the bonds at the tight end of the range. However, the yield of 4.569 per cent was the highest ever for new 50-year debt, which were first launched in May 2005.

One syndicate banker said: "This shows that the UK has not been

FT affected by worries about Greece and sovereign risk, although there is always strong structural demand from pension funds and insurance companies. This tends to give this part of the curve a strong bid."

# Prices and returns

The coupons showing on different gilts can have a wide range from 2.5 per cent to 12 per cent. These were (roughly) the rates of interest that the government had to offer at the time of issue. The wide variety reflects how interest rates have fluctuated during the past 80 or more years. These original percentages are not the rates of return offered on the gilt to a buyer in the secondary market today. So, if we take an undated gilt offering a coupon of 2.5 per cent on the nominal value we may find that investors are buying and selling this bond that offers £2.50 per year at a price of £50, not at its nominal value of £100. This gilt offers an investor today a yield of 5 per cent:

$$
\frac{\text{£2.50}}{\text{£50}}\times 100 = 5\%
$$

Thus we see some bonds trading above and, as in this case, below the nominal value of £100 in the secondary market. By means of this variation in the price of the bond, investors are able to receive the current going rate of return for that type of investment.

# Yield

There are two types of yields on dated gilts. The case of a Treasury 10 pc with five years to maturity currently selling in the secondary market at £120 will serve to illustrate the two different types. From the name of the gilt we glean that it pays a coupon of £10 per year (10 per cent of the nominal value of £100). For £120 investors can buy this gilt from other investors on the secondary market to receive a current yield (also known as the interest yield, flat yield, income yield, simple yield, annual yield and running yield) of 8.33 per cent.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {C u r r e n t} = \frac {\text {G r o s s (b e f o r e t a x) i n t e r s t c o u p o n}}{\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}} \times 1 0 0 \\ = \frac{\text{£}10}{\text{£}120}\times 100 = 8.33\% \\ \end{array}
$$

This is not the true rate of return available to the investor because we have failed to take into account the capital loss over the next five years. The investor pays £120 but will receive only the nominal value of £100 at maturity. If this £20 loss is apportioned over the five years it works out at £4 per year. The capital loss as a percentage of what the investor pays (£120) is £4/£120 × 100 = 3.33 per cent per year. This loss to redemption has to be subtracted from the annual interest yield to give an approximation to the yield to maturity (YTM) or redemption yield. This is also called or gross redemption yield ('gross' meaning that it ignores taxation on the bond). We do not know the bond holder's tax status and therefore cannot allow for tax deducted on the interest or capital received on the bond.

Approximation of the yield to maturity:  $8.33\% - 3.33\% = 5\%$

While this example tries to convey the essence of YTM calculations, it over-simplifies and a compound interest-type calculation is required to get a precise figure – we look at more precise calculations later in the chapter.

The general rules are:

- If a dated gilt is trading at below £100, the purchaser will receive a capital gain between purchase and redemption and so the YTM is greater than the current yield.
- If a dated gilt is selling at more than £100, a capital loss will be made if held to maturity and so the YTM is below the current yield.

Of course, these capital gains and losses are based on the assumption that the investor buys the gilt and then holds it to maturity. In reality many investors sell a few days or months after purchase, in which case they may make capital gains or losses dependent not on what the government pays on maturity but on the market price another investor is prepared to offer. This, in turn, depends on general economic conditions; in particular projected general inflation over the life of the gilt: investors will not buy a gilt offering a 5 per cent redemption yield over five years if future inflation is expected to be 7 per cent per year for that period. Interest rates (particularly for longer-term gilts) are thus strongly influenced by market perceptions of future inflation, which can shift significantly over a year or so.

Bond prices and redemption yields move in opposite directions. Take the case of our five-year gilt purchased for  $120$  offering a coupon of 10 per cent with a (approximate) redemption yield of 5 per cent. If general interest rates rise to 6 per cent because of an increase in inflation expectations, investors will no longer be interested in buying this gilt for  $\pounds 120$  because at this price it yields only 5 per cent. Demand will fall, resulting in a price reduction until the bond yields 6 per cent. A rise in yield goes hand in hand with a fall in price.

# Quotes

The gilts market is focused around gilt-edged market makers (GEMMS) who are prepared to buy from, or sell gilts to, investors. They quote two prices: the bid price is the price at which they will buy, the offer price is their selling price. The difference between the bid price and offer price is known as the dealer's spread, i.e. their potential profit. The table shown in Exhibit 6.4 is from a Saturday edition of the Financial Times; the week-day editions are not so detailed. More information is available at www.ft.com/bonds&rates.

Note that the current redemption yield shown in the  $FT$  is relevant only if you are an investor on that particular day paying the price shown. However, if you bought your gilt years ago and expect to hold to maturity you will receive the yield that was obtainable at the time of purchase.

Redemption yields for gilts are quoted daily online by the Debt Management Office at www.dmo.gov.uk. Other sources of information on prices, and on the gilts market generally, include Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com), Moody's (www.moodys.com), Standard & Poor's (www.standardandpoors.com), Fitch (www.fitchratings.com), J P Morgan (www.adr.com), Bondscape (www.bondscape.net).

# Cum-dividend and ex-dividend

Gilts usually pay coupons twice a year. Between payments the interest accrues on a daily basis. If you buy a gilt you are entitled to the accrued interest since the last coupon. You will receive this when the next coupon is paid. That is, you buy the gilt cum-dividend.

Gilts (and other bonds) are quoted at clean prices – that is, quoted without taking account of the accrued interest. However, the buyer will pay the clean price plus the accrued interest value (called the dirty price or full price or invoice price) and receives all of the next coupon. So, if you buy a gilt four months before the next coupon is due, you would pay the clean price, say £98, plus 60 days' accrued interest (i.e. two months of accrued coupon since the last was paid). The relationship between clean and dirty prices for a bond which pays a coupon every six months is:

$$
\text {D i r t y p r i c e} = \text {C l a n p r i c e} + \left[ \frac {\text {A n n u a l c o u p o n}}{2} \times \frac {\text {N u m b e r o f d a y s s i n c e l a s t c o u p o n}}{\text {N u m b e r o f d a y s s e p a r a t i n g c o u p o n p a y m e n t s}} \right]
$$

So, if the bond pays an annual coupon of 7 per cent and is currently quoted at a clean price of £101, the dirty price is:

$$
\text {D i r t y p r i c e} = £ 1 0 1 + \left[ \frac {\pmb {\mathcal {E}} 7}{2} \times \frac {6 0}{1 8 2} \right] = £ 1 0 2. 1 5 3 8 5
$$

If you bought just before the coupon is to be paid, the situation is different; there would not be enough time to change the register to make sure that the coupon goes to the new owner. To allow for this problem a gilt switches from being quoted cum-dividend to being ex-dividend (xd) a few days before an interest payment. If you bought during the ex-dividend period the person you bought from would receive the accrued interest from the issuer – this would be reflected in the price you pay.

# Index-linked gilts

There is a hidden danger with conventional gilts – inflation risk. Say, for example, that you, along with the rest of the gilt-buying community, think that inflation over the next ten years will average 2.5 per cent. As a result you buy ten-year gilts that have a redemption yield of 4.8 per cent, giving a comfortable real income over and above cost-of-living rises. However, two years later inflation starts to take off (oil prices quadruple, or the government goes on a spending spree, or whatever). Now investors reckon that inflation will average 6 per cent over the following eight years. As a result your gilt yield will fail to maintain your capital in real terms.

The government introduced a type of bond that ensures that you receive a return above the inflation rate throughout the entire life of the bond. These are called index-linked stocks (gilts), where the coupon amount, and the nominal value as well, are adjusted or uplifted according to the Retail Price Index (RPI). The deal here is that the gilt initially offers to pay £100 at the end of its term, say ten years away. It also offers to pay a low coupon, say 2 per cent. The key thing about index-linked bonds is that neither the capital sum on maturity nor the coupon stay at these levels unless inflation is zero over the next ten years.

Say inflation is 4 per cent over the first year of the bond's life. The payout on maturity would rise to £104. However, this inflation-linked up-lift happens every year. So, if over the ten years the inflation measure has risen by 60 per cent, the payout on the bond is £160. This means that you can buy just as many goods and services at the end with the capital sum as at the beginning of the bond's life (if you paid £100). (The situation is slightly more complicated than this in that the inflation figures used are those for the three months preceding the relevant coupon dates, but this example illustrates the principle.) Furthermore, the coupon rate also rises through the years if inflation is positive. So after the first year the coupons go up by  $4\%$ ,  $2\% \times (1 + 0.04) = 2.08\%$ , so for every £100 bond, the coupon is £2.08.

Any future rises in inflation lead to further growth in the coupon, so that the last coupon will be 60 per cent larger than the one paid in the first year if inflation over the ten years accumulates to 60 per cent, giving £3.20 per £100 nominal.

A final point on index-linked gilts: because most investors hold them to maturity, secondary trading is thin and dealing spreads are wider than for conventional gilts.

# Government bonds around the world

Most countries in the world issue government bonds which are similar in format to UK gilts and are given a credit rating (see Exhibit 6.5). Some countries are regarded as very safe ('triple-A rated') and so can issue at a low real (after allowing for anticipated inflation) yield. Others, such as Ukraine, are regarded as having more risk and so will have to pay a high-risk premium to entice investors to buy their bonds. Credit ratings are discussed in Chapter 5 and later in this chapter.

As communications have become easy and electronic banking the norm, all bond markets worldwide are interconnected and interest rates have become linked. So, in general, bonds worldwide pay similar rates of interest if they carry the same risk (and inflation is anticipated to be the same). Exhibit 6.6 shows the interest rates for a few of the bonds of the leading government issuers.

# US Treasury notes and bonds

Treasury notes are issued on behalf of the US government by Treasury Direct with a face value of 100 and a coupon payable every six months. They have a maturity of two, three, five, seven or ten years and are sold at monthly auctions, except for ten-year notes which are auctioned quarterly. The auctions are based on the yield amount and can be competitive or non-competitive. At the competitive auctions, only banks, brokers or dealers may bid, up to a maximum of 35 per cent of the total amount on offer, and they are allocated some or all of the requested amount. If they

When investors want to access how risky their investment might be in a particular country in debt they turn for help to one of the big credit rating agencies such as Standards & Poor's (S&P). These companies act like teachers, grading every nation according to the state of their economy, their public finances and the risk of things going wrong in the future. The lower the credit rating, the higher the cost of borrowing

Bid price. The price that a market maker will buy from an investor should he/she wish to sell. In the case of a UK government bond with the unit par value of £100 the price is £101.71

Yield changes over one day, week, month and year. The yields to redemption change (almost) every day as the bond price moves with the shifts in demand and supply in the secondary market bid at a price higher than that which allows the government to sell all the notes they want to – the cut-off price (or yield) – they will receive all they bid for. For the non-competitive element individuals may also bid and they are guaranteed to receive the amount requested, but they will pay the price that is the outcome of the competitive bid auction. The notes may be traded at any time up to maturity and their yield is quoted in financial publications.

Treasury bonds are auctioned quarterly, have a maturity date of 10-30 years and pay interest twice per year.

Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are index-linked bonds whose principal value is adjusted according to changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). They have maturities of 5, 10 or 30 years and interest is paid twice yearly at a fixed rate on the inflation-adjusted amount. The 5and 30-year securities are auctioned once a year and the 10-year security is auctioned twice a year.

US government notes and bonds are traded in an active secondary market (in an over-the-counter market rather than on a formal exchange), with dealers posting bid (buying) and ask (selling) prices, and trades conducted over the telephone or by electronic communication. Prices are quoted as a percentage of face value and on a clean basis.

# French bonds

The French Treasury, Agence France Trésor (AFT), sells by auction OATS (Obligations assimilables du Trésor), which are 7-50-year bonds, mostly fixed rate, but some with floating or index-linked rates, and BTANS (Bons du Trésor à intérêts annuels), which are 2-5-year bonds with a fixed rate of interest.

# German bonds

In Germany, the German financial agency, Bundesrepublik Deutschland Finanzagentur (BDF), issues at auction 2-, 5-, 10and 30-year notes and bonds, some of which are index-linked and the minimum bid is €1 million. Two-year Federal Treasury Notes – Bundesschatzanweisungen (Schätze) – five-year Federal Notes – Bundesobligationen (Bobls) – and 10and 30-year Federal Bonds – Bundesanleihen (Bunds) – are sold via pre-announced auctions by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, on behalf of the BDF.

The yield to maturity offered on German government bonds usually forms the reference or benchmark interest rate for other borrowings in the euro. In other words, it is the lowest rate available, with other interest rates described as so many basis points above, say, the ten-year bund rate.

# Japanese bonds

The Japanese Ministry of Finance issues Treasury discount bills and bonds. Japanese government bonds (JGBs) with a maturity of 2, 5, 10 and 20 years are auctioned monthly, 30-year bonds are auctioned every other month, and 40-year bonds quarterly. Inflation-indexed linked JGBs are also issued for ten-year maturities. Retail purchasers must purchase a minimum ¥10,000; other purchasers must buy at least ¥50,000 worth of bonds. Many JGBs are traded in the over-the-counter secondary market. A few are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other exchanges.

# Chinese bonds

In 2007, China began dealing in bonds and in 2009 it issued the first bonds denominated in the Chinese renminbi currency. These renminbi sovereign bonds were issued in Hong Kong and available to foreign investors only. China is keen to expand the use of its currency worldwide, hoping to decrease its reliance on the US dollar (China is the largest holder of US Treasury bills and so would be vulnerable if the dollar were to weaken).

# Corporate bonds

Corporate bonds offer a higher rate of return than well-represented government bonds but, as you might expect, this comes with a greater degree of risk of failure to pay what was agreed (default). They can be a very useful way for companies to raise money without issuing equity or accepting the conditions of a bank loan. Many corporate bonds are sufficiently negotiable (tradable) that they are listed on the London Stock Exchange and other exchanges in Europe, Asia or the Americas, but the majority of trading occurs in the OTC market directly between an investor and a bond dealer. Access to a secondary market means that the investor who originally provided the firm with money does not have to hold on to the bond until the maturity date. However, because so many investors buy and then hold to maturity rather than trade in and out, corporate bonds generally have very thin secondary markets compared with listed shares or money market instruments.

Corporate bonds have generally been the province of investing institutions, such as pension and insurance funds. Private investors tended not to hold them, mainly due to the large amounts of cash involved – the minimum is occasionally £1,000, more often £50,000. The par value of one bond at, say, £50,000, €50,000 or 50,000 is said to have a 50,000 minimum 'lot' or 'piece'. However, in 2010, the London Stock Exchange opened a secondary market trading facility for small investors for a limited range of bonds, where lots are just £100 or £1,000 and the costs of trading are relatively low.

# Infinite variation

Corporate bonds come in a variety of forms. The most common is the type with regular (usually semi-annual or annual) fixed coupons and a specified redemption date. These are known as straight, plain vanilla or bullet bonds. Other corporate bonds are a variation on this. Some pay coupons every three months, some do not pay a fixed coupon but one which varies depending on the level of short-term interest rates (floating rate or variable-rate bonds) and some have interest rates linked to the rate of inflation. In fact, the potential for variety and innovation is almost infinite. Bonds issued in the last few years have linked the interest rates paid or the principal payments to a wide variety of economic events, such as a rise in the price of silver, exchange-rate movements, stock market indices, the price of oil, gold, copper – even to the occurrence of an earthquake. These bonds were generally designed to let companies adjust their interest payments to manageable levels in the event of the firm being adversely affected by the changing of some economic variable. For example, a copper mining company, with its interest payments linked to the price of copper, would pay lower interest on its finance if the copper price were to fall. Sampdoria, the Italian football club, issued a €3.5 million bond that paid a higher rate of return if the club won promotion to the 'Serie A' division, 2.5 per cent if it stayed in Series B, 7 per cent if it moved to Series A and if the club rose to the top four in Series A the coupon would rise to 14 per cent.

# Debentures and loan stocks

In the UK and a few other countries the most secure type of bond is called a debenture. Debentures are usually secured by either a fixed or a floating charge against the firm's assets. A fixed charge means that specific assets (e.g. buildings, machinery) are used as security, which, in the event of default, can be sold at the insistence of the debenture bond holders and the proceeds used to repay them. Debentures are quite a common way of raising sums of money for capital expenditure – see the debentures issued by Diageo in Exhibit 6.1 for examples. Debentures secured on property may be referred to as mortgage debentures. A floating charge means that the loan is secured by a general charge on all the assets of the corporation (or a class of the firm's assets such as inventory or debtors). In this case the company has a high degree of freedom to use its assets as it wishes, such as sell them or rent them out, until it commits a default which 'crystallises' the floating charge. If this happens a receiver will be appointed with powers to dispose of assets and to distribute the proceeds to the creditors. Even though floating-charge debenture holders can force a liquidation, fixed-charge debenture holders rank above floating-charge debenture holders in the payout after insolvency.

The terms bond, debenture and loan stock are often used interchangeably and the dividing line between debentures and loan stock is a fuzzy one. As a general rule debentures are secured (have the backing of collateral) and loan stock is unsecured, but there are examples that do not fit this classification. If liquidation occurs, the unsecured loan stock holders rank beneath the debenture holders and some other categories of creditors such as the tax authorities.

In the US, Canada and some other countries the definitions are somewhat different and this can be confusing. In these places a debenture is a long-term unsecured bond and so the holders become general creditors who can claim only assets not otherwise pledged. In the US the secured form of bond is referred to as the mortgage bond and unsecured shorter-dated issues (less than ten years) are called notes.

# Trust deeds and covenants

Bond investors are willing to lower the interest they demand if they can be reassured that their money will not be exposed to a high risk. Reassurance is conveyed by placing risk-reducing restrictions on the firm. A trust deed (or bond indenture) sets out the terms of the contract between bond holders and the company. A trustee (if one is appointed) ensures compliance with the contract throughout the life of the bond and has the power to appoint a receiver (to liquidate the firm's assets). If a trustee is not appointed the usual practice is to give each holder an independently exercisable right to take legal action against a delinquent borrower.

The loan agreement will contain a number of affirmative covenants. These usually include the requirements to supply regular financial statements, interest and principal payments. The deed may also state the fees due to the lenders and details of what procedures should be followed in the event of a technical default, for example non-payment of interest.

In addition to these basic covenants are the negative (restrictive) covenants. These restrict the actions and the rights of the borrower until the debt has been repaid in full. Some examples are:

- Limits on further debt issuance If lenders provide finance to a firm they do so on certain assumptions concerning the riskiness of the capital structure. They will want to ensure that the loan does not become more risky due to the firm taking on a much greater debt burden relative to its equity base, so they limit the amount and type of further debt issues – particularly debt which has a higher (senior) ranking for interest payments or for a liquidation payment. Subordinated debt (junior debt) – with a low ranking on liquidation – is more likely to be acceptable.
- Dividend level Lenders are opposed to money being taken into the firm by borrowing at one end, while being taken away by shareholders in dividend payments at the other. An excessive withdrawal of shareholders' funds may unbalance the financial structure and weaken future cash flows.
- Limits on the disposal of assets The retention of certain assets, for example property and land, may be essential to reduce the lenders' risk.
- Financial ratios A typical covenant here concerns the interest cover, for example: 'The annual profit will remain four times as great as the overall annual interest charge.' Other restrictions might be placed on working capital ratio levels and the debt to net assets ratio.

While negative covenants cannot ensure completely risk-free lending they can influence the behaviour of the managerial team so as to reduce the risk of default. The lenders' risk can be further reduced by obtaining guarantees from third parties (for example guaranteed loan stock). The guarantor is typically the parent company of the issuer - see the Diageo example in Exhibit 6.1.

# Repayments

The principal on many bonds is paid entirely at maturity. However, there are bonds which can be repaid before the final redemption date. A common approach is for the company to issue bonds with a range of dates for redemption; so a bond dated 2018-2022 would allow a company the flexibility to repay the principal over four years. Another way of redeeming bonds is for the issuing firm to buy the outstanding bonds by offering the holder a sum higher than or equal to the amount originally paid. A firm is also able to purchase bonds on the open market.

One way of paying for redemption is to set up a sinking fund that receives regular sums from the firm which will be sufficient, with added interest, to redeem the bonds (the firm may use this to pay off a portion of the bond each year). The sinking fund is overseen by a trustee. The bonds may be purchased in the market either at market prices or at face value. Alternatively, bonds held by investors might be selected randomly and purchased. Because a bond with a sinking fund provision is less risky for the investor, as there is money being set aside, it carries a lower interest rate.

Some bonds are described as 'irredeemable' (or 'perpetual') as they have no fixed redemption date. From the investor's viewpoint they may be irredeemable but the firm has the option to repurchase and can effectively redeem the bonds when it wishes.

# Deep discounted bonds

Bonds which are sold at well below the par value are called deep discounted bonds, the most extreme form of which is the zero coupon bond. Because these are sold at a large discount to the nominal value, the investor makes a capital gain by holding the bond instead of receiving coupons. It is easy to calculate the rate of return offered to an investor on this type of bond. For example, if a company issues a bond at a price of £60 which is redeemable at £100 in eight years, the annualised rate of return  $(r)$  is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 6 0 (1 + r) ^ {8} = 1 0 0 \\ r = \sqrt [ 8 ]{\frac {100}{60}} - 1 = 0.066 \text {or} 6.6 \% \text {per year} \\ \end{array}
$$

These bonds are particularly useful for firms with low cash flows in the near term, for example firms engaged in a major property development that will not mature for many years.

# Floating rate notes

A major market has developed over the past three decades called the floating-rate note (FRN) (also called variable-rate notes) market. Two factors have led to the rapid growth in FRN usage. First, the oscillating and unpredictable inflation of the 1970s and 1980s caused many investors to make large real-term losses on fixed-rate bonds as the interest rate fell below the inflation rate. As a result many lenders became reluctant to lend at fixed rates on a long-term basis. This reluctance led to FRNs being cheaper for the issuer because it does not need to offer an interest premium to compensate the investor for being locked into a fixed rate. Second, a number of corporations, especially financial institutions, hold assets which give a return that varies with the short-term interest rate level (for example, bank loans and overdrafts) and so prefer to have a similar floating-rate liability. These instruments pay an interest rate that is linked to a benchmark rate – such as the LIBOR (see Chapter 5). The issuer will pay, say, 70 basis points (0.7 of a percentage point) over LIBOR. The coupon might be set for the first six months at the time of issue, after which it is adjusted every six months, so if LIBOR was 3 per cent, the FRN would pay 3.7 per cent for that particular six months.

# Credit rating

Firms often pay to have their bonds rated by specialist credit-rating organisations (see Chapter 5). The debt rating depends on the likelihood of payments of interest and/or capital not being paid (that is, default) and in some cases on the extent to which the lender is protected in the event of a default by the loan issuer (the recoverability of debt). Government bonds from the leading economies have an insignificant risk of default whereas unsecured subordinated corporate loan stock has a much higher risk.

A top rating (AAA) indicates very high quality, where the capacity to repay interest and principal is extremely strong. Single A indicates a strong capacity to pay interest and capital but there is some degree of susceptibility to impairment as economic events unfold. BBB indicates adequate debt service capacity but vulnerability to adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances. Band C-rated debt has predominantly speculative characteristics. The lowest is D, which indicates the firm is in default. Ratings of BBB- (or Baa3 for Moody's) or above are regarded as 'investment grade' – this is important because many institutional investors are permitted to invest only in investment grade bonds. Bonds rated below investment grade are called high-yield (or junk) bonds.

The agencies consider a wide range of quantitative and qualitative factors in determining the rating for a bond. The quantitative factors include the ratio of assets to liabilities of the company, cash-flow generation and the amount of debt outstanding. The qualitative factors include the competitive position of the company, quality of management and vulnerability to the economic cycle.

The rating and re-rating of bonds is followed with great interest by borrowers and lenders and can give rise to some heated argument. Frequently borrowers complain that their ratings are not judged to be as high as they think they should be, with the result that higher interest rates are payable on their bonds.

The same company can issue bonds with different ratings: one may be raised because it is higher ranking in the capital structure, meaning that if the firm runs into trouble and has difficulty paying its debts the holders of this bond will be paid before the holders of lower-ranking bonds (the subordinated debt). Another difference may be that one bond is secured on specific assets. The ranking order for bonds is:

1 Senior secured debt

2 Senior unsecured debt

3 Senior subordinated debt

4 Subordinated debt

The rating agencies also provide issuer ratings to firms and other organisations, which are assessments of the creditworthiness of the whole entity rather than of a particular bond.

Bond credit ratings are available at www.standardandpoors.com, www.moodys.com and www.fitchratings.com. The Financial Times shows credit ratings daily in the tables titled 'Bonds - Global Investment Grade' and 'Bonds - High Yield & Emerging Market' together with yields to redemption and other details - see Exhibits 6.7 and 6.8 (more at www.ftcom/bonds&rates). These give the reader some idea of current market conditions and yield to maturity demanded for bonds of different maturities, currencies and riskiness. The ratings shown are for March 2011 and will not necessarily be applicable in future years because the creditworthiness and the specific debt issue can change significantly in a short period. (In the table  $S^* =$  Standard & Poor's,  $M^* =$  Moody's and  $F^* =$  Fitch.) A key measure in the bond markets is the 'spread', which is the number of basis points a bond is yielding above a benchmark rate, usually the government bond yield to maturity for that currency and period to redemption.

The so-called 'emerging markets' are, to a large extent, now fully emerged, with many countries such as Brazil and Mexico having fully functioning corporate bond markets drawing on local savings to raise funds for businesses - see Exhibit 6.9.

# Corporate bond issues go local to deliver capital lift

Corporate bond issuance in emerging market currencies has surged to record levels this year, deepening the local sources of capital for companies.

Groups have tapped increasing demand for local currency bonds not only from foreign investors but also a growing number of domestic funds seeking exposure to corporate debt.

This has lowered the cost of borrowing and reduced the risk for companies that foreign fund managers might stop buying their debt in times of crisis.

Emerging market corporate bond issuance has jumped to 68 billion so far this year, up 58 percent on the same period last year, according to Dealoric.

Local currency corporate bond issuance has made up 49 billion of this, a 29 per cent jump on the same period last year and a 308 per cent increase on the same period three years ago, when these markets were smaller and more immature.

Companies that have tapped the market this year include multinationals such as Vale, the Brazilian iron ore producer, Pemex, the Mexican oil company, TNK-BP, the Russian arm of oil group BP and CNPC, the Chinese energy group.

However, smaller companies are increasingly able to borrow in

Corporate bond issuance in emerging market countries the local currency markets, helped by the development of pension fund industries in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile and South Korea. This is because domestic pension funds want assets denominated in their own currencies.

For example, in Mexico, Alsea, the restaurant operator, and Infonavit, the government-backed mortgage lender, have issued bonds recently.

These bonds saw strong demand and traded higher in the secondary market once they were priced, underlining the appetite for this debt.

The local currency corporate bond markets have also been boosted by a lengthening of the average maturity of emerging market government bonds.

This is enabling companies to issue longer-dated debt that gives them more stability as they can lock in fixed rates, often up to 10 years.

For example, the average maturity of government debt has risen above five years in Mexico, which is now longer than in the US with an average maturity of 4.8 years.

In both Brazil and Turkey, the average maturity of government debt has increased to three years from one and a half years in 2005.

Brett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Managers, said: "In effect, many emerging markets are becoming more like developed markets as they become more sophisticated."

A lot of weight is placed on bond ratings by financial institutions and investors, who rely on them for investment actions and can feel aggrieved if the bond ratings fail to live up to expectations. In 2009, the ratings agencies were criticised for not spotting the dangers in a number of bonds which gained their income from thousands of US mortgages (see Exhibit 6.10).

# Bond default rates

Table 6.1 shows the proportion of bonds that have defaulted one, two, three, four, five and ten years after issue over the period 1990-2010. Notice the large differences in default rates between the ratings. After five years only 0.17 per cent of AA bonds defaulted, whereas 11.68 per cent of B bonds defaulted. When examining data on default rates it is important to appreciate that default is a wide-ranging term and could refer to any number of events, from a missed payment to

# Ratings agency model left largely intact

Big banks are not the only groups whose income is soaring on the back of commissions and fees from selling and trading the huge amounts of debt being sold by governments, banks and companies.

Credit rating agencies, the biggest of which are Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, have also seen a surge in revenue, as most debt that is issued - government-backed or not - comes with a credit rating for which the borrower pays a fee.

…The rating agencies remain central to the debt markets and their business models today remain largely intact, in spite of widespread claims that they exacerbated the credit crisis. The criticism centres on the fact that Moody's, S&P and Fitch gave triple A ratings to hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds backed by risky mortgages - but these securities have since been downgraded and are in many cases now worthless.

Ratings continue to be written into the official criteria used by many investors to define what debt they can and cannot buy. They are also still central to risk assessments by regulators. Ironically, some of the biggest investors and borrowers are suing the rating agencies.

The largest pension fund in the US, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), has filed a suit against the three leading rating agencies over potential losses of more than 1 billion over what it says are 'wildly inaccurate' triple A ratings. That is just one of many cases. S&P currently faces about 40 separate lawsuits from investors and institutions.

In the past, most lawsuits have failed because rating agencies are protected by the first amendment right to free speech. Their ratings are an 'opinion' and therefore subject to free speech protections.

Whether this will continue to be the case is a key factor in the debate about the future of the industry.

"We are all watching the Calpers suit," says Donald Ross, global strategist at Boyd Watterson Asset Management. "It may be dismissed like many other suits have been on the basis of free speech, but it has the potential to restructure the credit rating business model."

This week's proposed legislation by the US Treasury to reform rating agencies is not widely regarded as fundamentally changing the business of ratings, even though it does put more controls in place.

Already, rating agencies have themselves undertaken reviews aimed at restoring confidence in their ratings, particularly on the structured finance part of the business that includes bonds backed by loans such as mortgages and where most of the controversies have been. This week, a decision by S&P to upgrade bonds backed by commercial mortgages to triple A, just a week after severely cutting them from triple A, highlights the clout of ratings (and the scope to confuse investors).

Michael Barr, the Treasury's assistant secretary for financial institutions, portrayed the proposed legislation as an attempt to ensure that better information is put into the market and to encourage the right incentives for the issuance of ratings.

Other models, including the investor-paid model, also have inherent conflicts of interest that would pose problems, Mr Barr said.

No matter what the reforms, "we are not going to be able to eliminate the need for investors to use their own judgment … The one thing we want to make clear … no investor should take as a matter of blind faith what the ratings [agency's] judgment is," Mr Barr said this week.

The SEC, which has created a new group of examiners to oversee the sector, is looking for ways to reduce reliance on credit ratings. Mary Shapiro, chairman of the SEC, said at a Congressional hearing that new rules would be put forward later this summer.

She said one rule would require issuers to disclose preliminary ratings to get rid of "pernicious" ratings shopping (when a company solicits a preliminary rating from an agency but only pays for and discloses the highest rating it receives); disclose information underlying the ratings; look at sources of revenue disclosure and performance history of ratings over one, five and 10-year periods; and see how the SEC could get investors to do additional due diligence of its own.

"While the administration's proposals are well-intentioned, they are easily criticised as merely cosmetic," says Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University. "If you really want change you have to recognise that the industry is dominated by two agencies and the SEC should create a new category of agencies owned by investors."

The status of rating agencies means they have access to information that is not made public, information they do not need to disclose, and this is one reason they are supposed to have better insights into companies and deals than ordinary investors might. It is this special status that some believe should be targeted. "When an opinion has regulatory power, which is what ratings have, it has to come with some accountability," says Arturo Cifuentes, principal with Atacama Partners, a financial advisory firm.

"It is not enough to say it is just an opinion, because it carries more weight than that in the financial system."

bankruptcy. For some of these events all is lost from the investor's perspective; for other events a very high percentage, if not all, of the interest and principal is recovered. Hickman (1958) observed that defaulted publicly held and traded bonds tended to sell for 40 cents on the dollar. This average recovery-rate rule of thumb seems to have held over time – in approximate terms – with senior secured bank loans returning more than 60 per cent and subordinated bonds less than 30 per cent.

# High-yield (junk) bonds

High-yield or junk bonds are debt instruments offering a high return with a high risk. They may be either unsecured or secured but rank behind senior loans and bonds. This type of debt generally offers interest rates 2-9 percentage points more than that on senior debt and frequently gives the lenders some right to a share in equity values should the firm perform well. It is a kind of hybrid finance, ranking for payment below straight debt but above equity – it is thus described alternatively as subordinated, intermediate, or low grade. One of the major attractions of this form of finance for the investor is that it often comes with equity warrants or share options attached (see Chapter 11), which can be used to obtain shares in the firm – this is known as an equity kicker. These may be triggered by an event such as the firm joining the stock market.

Bonds with high-risk and high-return characteristics may have started as apparently safe investments but have now become more risky (fallen angels), or they may be bonds issued specifically to provide higher-risk financial instruments for investors. This latter type began its rise to prominence in the US in the 1980s and is now a market with over 100 billion issued per year. The rise of the US junk bond market meant that no business was safe from the threat of takeover, however large – see case study 6.1 on Michael Milken.

# Issuers of high-yield bonds

High-yield bond finance tends to be used when bank borrowing limits are reached and the firm cannot or will not issue more equity. The finance it provides is cheaper (in terms of required return) than would be available on the equity market and it allows the owners of a business to raise large sums of money without sacrificing voting control. It is a form of finance that permits the firm to move beyond what is normally considered acceptable debt:equity ratios (financial gearing, leverage levels).

High-yield bonds have been employed by firms 'gearing themselves up' to finance merger activity and also for leveraged recapitalisations. For instance, a firm might have run into trouble,

# Case study 6.1 The junk bond wizard: Michael Milken

While studying at Wharton Business School in the 1970s Michael Milken came to the belief that the gap in interest rates between safe bonds and high-yield bonds was excessive, given the relative risks. This created an opportunity for financial institutions to make an acceptable return from junk bonds, given their risk level.

At the investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, Milken was able to persuade a large body of institutional investors to supply finance to the junk bond market as well as provide a service to corporations wishing to grow through the use of junk bonds. Small firms were able to raise billions of dollars to take over large US corporations. Many of these issuers of junk bonds had debt ratios of 90 per cent and above – for every \$1 of share capital \$9 was borrowed. These gearing levels were concerning for many in the financial markets. It was thought that companies were pushing their luck too far and indeed many did collapse under the weight of their debt.

The market was dealt a particularly severe blow when Michael Milken was convicted, sent to jail and ordered to pay  \$600 million in fines. Drexel was also convicted, paid\$ 650 million in fines and filed for bankruptcy in 1990.

The junk bond market was in a sorry state in the early 1990s, with high levels of default and few new issues. However, it did not take long for the market to recover.

defaulted and its assets are now under the control of a group of creditors, including bankers and bond holders. One way to allow the business to continue would be to persuade the creditors to accept alternative financial securities in place of their debt securities to bring the leverage (financial gearing) to a reasonable level. They might be prepared to accept a mixture of shares and high-yield bonds. The bonds permit the holders to receive high interest rates in recognition of the riskiness of the firm, and they open up the possibility of an exceptionally high return from warrants or share options should the firm get back to a growth path. The alternative for the lenders may be a return of only a few pence in the pound from the immediate liquidation of the firm's assets.

Junk bond borrowing usually leads to high debt levels, resulting in a high fixed-cost imposition on the firm. This can be a dangerous way of financing expansion and therefore the use of these types of finance has been criticised. Nevertheless, some commentators have praised the way in which high gearing and large annual interest payments have focused the minds of managers and engendered extraordinary performance. Also, without this finance, many takeovers, buyouts and financial restructurings would not take place.

Fast-growing companies also make use of junk bonds. They have been particularly attractive sources for telecommunications and some media businesses which require large investments in the near term but also can offer a relatively stable profits flow in the long term.

# Market price movements

Investment-grade bond prices and returns tend to move in line with government bond interest rates, influenced by perceptions of future inflation rather than the risk of default. Junk bond prices (and their yields), meanwhile, are much more related to the prospects for the company's trading fundamentals because the company needs to thrive if it is to cope with the high debt levels and raised interest, and cause the equity kicker to have some value. Thus the factors that affect equity valuation also impact on junk bond valuations. As a result high-yield bonds tend to be more volatile than investment-grade bonds, going up and down depending on expectations concerning the company's survival, strength and profitability.

# Comparing US and European high-yield bond markets

The high-yield bond is much more popular in the US than in Europe because of European financial institutions' aversion (constrained by legislation) to such instruments and because of an attachment to bank borrowing as the main way to borrow. The European high-yield bond market is in its infancy. The first high-yield bonds denominated in European currencies were issued as recently as 1997 when Geberit, a Swiss/UK manufacturer, raised DM157.5 million by selling ten-year bonds offering an interest rate which was 423 basis points (4.23 per cent) higher than the interest rate on a ten-year German government bond (bund). Since then there have been hundreds of issues. However, the European high-yield market remains about one-quarter of the size of the US one, although it is growing again after a freeze in 2008 – see Exhibit 6.11.

As €10 billion (14.28 billion) in orders flooded in from investors for Italian car maker Fiat's junk bond last month, even the company's bankers were surprised by the torrent of demand for a €1.25 billion offering of risky debt. Just a few weeks earlier, such a deal might not have been possible.

Indeed, risk aversion levels were so high during the first 18 months of the financial crisis that the European high-yield market was completely closed to new issues.

Yet such has been the change of sentiment in recent weeks that European high-yield bonds have become the best performing fixed income asset class globally - returning almost 50 per cent in 2009, according to Credit Suisse.

So far this year the market has swallowed €6.1 billion of euro-denominated junk bonds, according to Société Générale. The total includes a €2.7 billion bond from Italian telecoms company Wind – the biggest ever unsecured European junk bond – and the Fiat issue. Overall issuance is bigger because it includes other currencies.

Digging down into banks' order books highlights a radical change in the sources of demand for high-yield paper.

With both Wind and Irish bottling company Ardagh Glass, over 70 per cent of orders were from longer term or so-called "realmoney" investors, according to analysis by debt information provider Capital Structure. Before the credit crunch, it was typically hedge funds and structured credit investors which accounted for the bulk of demand in Europe.

Issuance begins to recover after barren period

Demand now is driven by pension and insurance funds, suggesting a new pool of long-term liquidity is evolving for riskier European borrowers and one which could be more permanent. The buyers include fund management groups such as Threadneedle - as well as investors that have dedicated high-yield funds such as Bluebay Asset Management.

"European high yield has had a number of false dawns but the expectation is that this time it will be more sustainable," says Dagmar Kent Kershaw, Head of Credit Fund Management at Intermediate Capital Group. "It is fantastic news for a high-yield market which has been starved of product."

Matthew Cestar, co-head of Credit Capital Markets at Credit Suisse, says: "Wind was a seminal deal for Europe, given its multibillion euro size and complexity. Even in the US, we have only seen a handful of high-yield deals north of a billion dollars. There was some scepticism about whether you could get a deal away this size, but it was well digested and has rallied because of the scarcity of paper and the quality of the company."

The revival in the high-yield market reflects the strong increase in global risk appetite in recent months as well as a view that default levels may fall short of earlier estimates.

While the US junk bond market has been long established, the European high-yield market has only developed over the past decade. Unlike the US, where borrowers have a long tradition of using bond markets to fund themselves. European companies relied heavily on bank debt in the past.

According to Barclays Capital, the European junk bond market is set to grow from €100 billion currently to €150 billion by the end of 2012. The revival in high yield has also sparked interest in the leveraged loan market, which has rallied 25 per cent this year.

# Local authority/municipal bonds

Local authority and municipal bonds (Munis) are bonds issued by governments at a subnational level, such as a county, city or state, which pay a fixed rate of interest and are repayable on a specific future date, similar in fact to Treasury bonds. They are a means of raising money to finance developments, buildings or expansion by the local authority. They are riskier than sovereign bonds (the issuers cannot print their own money as governments might) as from time to time cities, etc. do go bust and fail to pay their debts. However, many issuers, particularly in Europe and the US, obtain bond insurance, from a private insurance group with a top credit rating, guaranteeing that the bond will be serviced on time. This reduces the interest rate they pay.

General-obligation bonds offer the bond holder a priority claim on the general (usually tax) revenue of the issuer in the event of a default, whereas a holder of revenue bonds receives interest and principal repayment from the revenues of a particular project, e.g. the income from a toll bridge.

In the UK, they are out of favour at the moment, although Transport for London issued a 25-year bond in 2006 and there is talk of issuing a 'Brummie' bond (by Birmingham council). In the US and some other countries they are big business – over 2,000 billion in the US. US municipal bonds issued by state and local governments are usually tax exempt, which means that investors do not have to pay federal income tax on the interest they receive. Because of this concession they usually trade at lower yields to maturity than US government bonds. In Japan, over 30 prefectures and cities have issued bonds which in 2007 totalled more than ¥3½ trillion. The German Länder (states) are also large issuers.

Bonds are also issued by counties, school districts, airports, water systems and highways, with the aim of raising finance for specific targets. There are also quasi-state organisations issuing bonds in Europe. In France, Electricité de France, (EdF) and Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF, the French railway operator), and in Germany, Deutsche Bahn (DB, the German railway company) are just some of the institutions which have issued bonds.

# Convertible bonds

Convertible bonds (or convertible loan stocks) carry a rate of interest in the same way as ordinary bonds, but they also give the holder the right to exchange the bonds at some stage in the future into ordinary shares according to some prearranged formula. The owner of these bonds is not obliged to exercise this right of conversion and so the bonds may continue until redemption as an interest-bearing instrument. Conversion of these bonds into shares may have the effect of diluting the value of individual shares – there is an increase in the number of shares as more are created, but not necessarily any increase in the profits/value of the company. Usually the conversion price is 10–30 per cent greater than the share price at the date of the bond issuance. So, if a £100 bond offered the right to convert to 40 ordinary shares, the conversion price would be £2.50 (that is £100 ÷ 40), which, given the market price of the shares of, say, £2.20, would be a conversion premium of 30p divided by £2.20, which equals 13.6 per cent.

Venture Production, a North Sea oil explorer, issued convertible bonds in July 2005. The issue raised £29 million. The bonds were to be redeemed in 2010 if they had not been converted before this and were issued at a par value of £100. The coupon was set at 4.25 per cent and the conversion price was at 474p per share. From this information we can calculate the conversion ratio:

$$
\text {C o n v e r s i o n} = \frac {\text {N o m i n a l (p a r) v a l u e o f b o n d}}{\text {C o n v e r s i o n p r i c e}} = \frac {\text {£ 1 0 0}}{\text {£ 4 . 7 4}} = 2 1. 1 \text {s h a r e s}
$$

Each bond carries the right to convert to 21.1 shares, which is equivalent to paying  $474\mathrm{p}$  for each share at the  $\mathbb{L}100$  par value of the bond.

Unusually, in this particular case if the bonds were not converted or redeemed then the holder was to receive 110 per cent of par value rather than simply the par value in October 2010, to give a total yield to maturity of 5.904 per cent. The conversion price was set at a premium of 16 per cent over the ordinary share price at the time of pricing; this was  $408\mathrm{p}$ $(474 - 408) / 408 = 16$  per cent). At the time of the issue many investors may have looked at the low interest rate on the convertible and said to themselves that although this was greater than the dividend yield on shares (3 per cent) it was less than that on conventional bonds, but offsetting this was the prospect of capital gains made by converting the bonds into shares. If the shares rose to, say, £6, each £100 bond could be converted to 21.1 shares worth 21.1 £6 = × £126.6.

The value of a convertible bond (a type of equity-linked bond) rises as the value of ordinary shares increases, but at a lower percentage rate. The value could be analysed as a 'debt portion', which depends on the discounted value of the coupons, and an 'equity portion', where the right to convert is an equity option. If the share price rises above the conversion price, investors may choose to exercise the option to convert if they anticipate that the share price will at least be maintained and the dividend yield is higher than the convertible bond yield. If the share price rise is seen to be temporary, the investor may wish to hold on to the bond. If the share price remains below the conversion price, the value of the convertible will be the same as a straight bond at maturity.

Exhibit 6.12 describes some of the technical terms associated with convertibles.

# Exhibit 6.12 Convertible bond technical jargon

# Conversion ratio

This gives the number of ordinary shares into which a convertible bond may be converted:

$$
\text {C o n v e r s i o n} = \frac {\text {N o m i n a l (p a r) v a l u e o f b o n d}}{\text {C o n v e r s i o n p r i c e}}
$$

# Conversion price

This gives the price of each ordinary share obtainable by exchanging a convertible bond:

$$
\text {C o n v e r s i o n p r i c e} = \frac {\text {N o m i n a l (p a r) v a l u e o f b o n d}}{\text {N u m b e r o f s h a r e s i n t o w h i c h b o n d m a y b e c o n v e r t e d}}
$$

# Conversion premium

This gives the difference between the conversion price and the market share price, expressed as a percentage:

$$
\text {C o n v e r s i o n p r e m i u m} = \frac {\text {C o n v e r s i o n p r i c e} - \text {M a r k e t s h a r e p r i c e}}{\text {M a r k e t s h a r e p r i c e}} \times 1 0 0
$$

# Conversion value

This is the value of a convertible bond if it were converted into ordinary shares at the current share price:

$$
\text {C o n v e r s i o n v a l u e} = \text {C u r r e n t s h a r e p r i c e} \times \text {C o n v e r s i o n r a t i o}
$$

Convertibles with large conversion premiums trade much like ordinary bonds because the option to convert is not a strong feature in their pricing. They offer higher yields and prices are not volatile. Those trading with a small conversion premium have lower yields and the prices are more volatile as they are more closely linked with the share price.

The right to convert may specify a date or several dates over, say, a four-year period, or any time between two dates.

# The advantages of convertibles

The advantages of convertible bonds to investors are:

1 Investors are able to wait and see how the share price moves before investing in equity.

2 In the near term there is greater security for their principal compared with equity investment, and the annual coupon is usually higher than the dividend yield.

Raising money by selling convertible bonds has the following advantages to the issuing company:

1 Lower interest than on a similar debenture The firm can ask investors to accept a lower interest on these debt instruments because the investor values the conversion right. This was a valuable feature for many dot.com companies when starting out. Amazon and AOL could pay 5-6 per cent on convertibles - less than half what they would have paid on straight bonds.

2 The interest is tax deductible Because convertible bonds are a form of debt the coupon payment can be regarded as a cost of the business and can therefore be used to reduce taxable profit.

3 Self-liquidating When the share price reaches a level at which conversion is worthwhile the bonds will (normally) be exchanged for shares so the company does not have to find cash to pay off the loan principal – it simply issues more shares. This has obvious cash-flow benefits. However, the disadvantage is that the other equity holders may experience a reduction in earnings per share and dilution of voting rights.

4 Fewer restrictive covenants The directors have greater operating and financial flexibility than they would with a secured debenture. Investors accept that a convertible is a hybrid between debt and equity finance and do not tend to ask for high-level security (they are unsecured and subordinated), impose strong operating restrictions on managerial action or insist on strict financial ratio boundaries. Many Silicon Valley companies with little more than a web portal and a brand have used convertibles because of the absence of need to provide a collateral or stick to asset:borrowing ratios.

5 Underpriced shares A company which wishes to raise equity finance over the medium term but judges that the stock market is temporarily underpricing its shares may turn to convertible bonds. If the firm performs as the managers expect and the share price rises, the convertible will be exchanged for equity.

6 Cheap way to issue shares Graham and Harvey (2001) found that managers favoured convertibles as an inexpensive way to issue 'delayed' equity. Equity is raised at a later date without the high costs of rights issues, etc.

7 Available finance when straight debt and equity are not available Some firms locked out of the equity markets (e.g. because of poor recent performance) and the straight debt markets because of high levels of indebtedness may still be able to raise money in the convertible market. Firms use convertible debt 'to attract investors unsure about the riskiness of the company' (Graham and Harvey (2001)).

The bonds sold may give the right to conversion into shares not of the issuers but shares of another company held by the issuer – see the cases of Hutchison Whampoa, Telecom Italia and France Telecom in Exhibit 6.13. Note that the term 'exchangeable bond' is probably more appropriate in these cases.

# Strip bonds

Strips/strip bonds are broken down into their individual cash flows. The dividends or coupons are separated from the bond and are then negotiable zero coupon instruments in their own right with a fixed maturity date and guaranteed payment at maturity. A bond with seven years to run could be stripped into 15 separate zero coupon instruments, the 14 half-yearly dividend payments and the bond itself. As all parts of the bond are now zero coupon, they are traded at a discount to their nominal value.

In January Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa sold \$2.65 billion of bonds exchangeable into shares of Vodafone, the UK mobile phone operator. Hutchison had been gradually divesting its stake in the UK group since completing a \$3 billion exchangeable bond deal last September.

This was followed at the end of the month by Telecom Italia which sold €2 billion of bonds exchangeable into shares of subsidiaries Telecom Italia Mobile and Internet operator Seat.

In February France Telecom sold €3.3 billion of bonds exchangeable into shares of

Orange, completed at the same time as the mobile unit's IPO, and one of the biggest exchangeable bond deals ever sold in Europe.

The name 'strips' actually stands for separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities, but it is also a good name for its role of separating the coupons from the principal.

The idea of stripping bonds and trading the coupons separately from the bond originated in the 1980s in North America and involved the actual physical cutting of the coupon from its bond. The concept gained in popularity, partly because they can offer investing institutions the maturity profile they need and partly because there can be tax advantages in taking a capital gain rather than interest income. The UK started issuing gilt-edged strips in 1997 and by the mid-2000s most countries in the world of finance allowed stripping of government bonds, with Canada allowing stripping of all bonds, government, municipal and corporate.

To avoid the possibility of losing the actual coupon, which tended to be a small piece of paper, easy to mislay, the stripping is now done electronically and official records are kept. Not all bonds are strippable. In the UK, the DMO lists all the separate parts of the bonds which are able to be stripped, the date on which the stripping commenced and which bonds have been reconstituted. In the US, Treasury Direct gives the same information about US bonds. There are nearly 40 bonds which are strippable, resulting in some 7,000 individual strips. Reconstitution of a stripped bond is possible, where the bond is reassembled once more into a coupon-paying instrument.

# Securitisation

In the strange world of modern finance you sometimes need to ask yourself who ends up with your money when you pay your monthly mortgage, or your credit card bill or the instalment payment on your car. In the old days you would have found that it was the organisation you originally borrowed from and whose name is at the top of the monthly statement. Today you cannot be so sure because there is now a thriving market in repackaged debt. In this market, a mortgage lender, for example, collects together a few thousand mortgage 'claims' it has (the right of the lender to receive regular interest and capital from the borrowers); it then sells those claims in a collective package to other institutions, or participants in the market generally. This permits the replacement of long-term assets with cash (improving liquidity and financial gearing), which can then be used to generate more mortgages. It may also allow a profit on the difference between the interest on the mortgages and the interest on the bonds. This can happen if the original mortgages pay, say, 6 per cent and the bonds secured on the flow of payments from the mortgagees pay 5 per cent. The extra 1 per cent (less costs) can enable the originator to sell the bonds for a price in excess of the amount it lent to the mortgagees.

The borrower is often unaware that the mortgage is no longer owned by the original lender and everything appears as it did before, with the mortgage company acting as a collecting agent for the buyer of the mortgages. The mortgage company is usually said to be a seller of asset-backed securities (ABS) to other institutions (the 'assets' are the claim on interest and capital) and so this form of finance is often called asset securitisation. These asset-backed securities may be bonds sold into a market with many players. Rather than selling bonds in the mortgage company itself a new company is established, called a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or special purpose entity (SPE). This new entity is then given the right to collect the cash flows from the mortgages. It has to pay the mortgage company for this. To make this payment it sells bonds secured against the assets of the SPV (e.g. mortgage claims). By creating an SPV there is a separation of the creditworthiness of the assets involved from the general credit worthiness of the mortgage company.

Asset-backed securitisation involves the pooling and repackaging of relatively small, homogeneous and illiquid financial assets into liquid securities.

The sale of the financial claims can be either 'non-recourse', in which case the buyer of the securities from the mortgage firm or the lender to the SPV (e.g. bond holder) bears the risk of non-payment by the borrowers, or with recourse to the mortgage lender.

Securitisation has even reached the world of rock. Iron Maiden issued a long-dated \$30 million asset-backed bond securitised on future earnings from royalties. It followed David Bowie's \$55 million bond securitised on the income from his earlier albums and Rod Stewart's 15.4 million securitised loan from Nomura. Tussauds has securitised ticket and merchandise sales, Keele University has securitised the rental income from student accommodation and Arsenal has securitised £260 million future ticket sales at the Emirates Stadium. Loans to Hong Kong taxi drivers have been securitised, as have the cash flows from UK funeral fees.

Securitisation is regarded as beneficial to the financial system because it permits banks and other financial institutions to focus on those aspects of the lending process where they have a competitive edge. Some, for example, have a greater competitive advantage in originating loans than in funding them, so they sell the loans they have created, raising cash to originate more loans. Other motives include the need to change the risk profile of the bank's assets (e.g. reduce its exposure to the housing market) or to reduce the need for reserve capital (if the loans are removed from the asset side of the bank's balance sheet it does not need to retain the same quantity of reserves) – the released reserve capital can then be used in more productive ways.

Securitisation was at the heart of the financial turmoil in 2007 when US sub-prime (poor quality) mortgage borrowers failed to repay in substantial numbers. Mortgage-backed bonds of SPVs plummeted in value, the asset-backed bond market froze and the business model of lending to households expecting to sell bonds backed with a bunch of mortgages (à la Northern Rock) became untenable as no one would buy the securitised bonds.

Exhibit 6.14 describes the securitisation of Dunkin' Donuts' royalties received from its hundreds of franchises around the world – a steady source of income.

In a corporate securitisation, assets and related cash flows are carved out from a business into special purpose entities (SPEs) and repackaged. Debt is then raised against the SPEs alone.

'Securitisation isolates a cash flow and insulates it from extraneous events,' says Ted Yarbrough, head of global securitised products at Citigroup.

Depending on the credit quality and the quantum of borrowing, part or all the debt may be highly rated, and there is sometimes a low-rated or unrated subordinated slice of debt as well.

A financing structured this way can achieve higher credit ratings than the business on its own. This partly reflects the structural aspects - for example, the fact that the SPEs can survive a bankruptcy of the umbrella group – and partly the fact that the securities issued are often 'wrapped', or guaranteed, by highly-rated bond insurers such as Ambac, Figic or MBIA in return for a fee.

This is a complex and costly exercise, but can result in much cheaper debt. Once established, a securitisation can be tapped again later if a business grows.

# Exhibit 6.14 continued

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/237d552e43d29eba7ec6bc979be0e1af23bdd81d0838d7f9dbaffde3336c71ce.jpg)

* Special purpose entitles owning franchise agreements, brands etc.
** Often guaranteed by bond insurer in return for additional fee

Sometimes securitisation is best suited to part of a business rather than the whole. When applied to an entire business, as with Dunkin' Brands or Domino's, the new financing typically replaces all traditional debt.

While a securitisation does involve financial constraints, they can be fewer and less onerous than with traditional bank and bond debt. Managers would, for example, have greater flexibility to pay dividends or buy back stock.

This reflects the fact that financiers in a securitisation look only to the specific assets and cash flows held within the SPEs. But Eric Hedman, analyst at Standard & Poor's in New York, notes there can be a trade-off in terms of operational flexibility. 'Prior to the securitisation, Dunkin' was an owner operator. Now, the company is no longer the franchisor, there's an SPE. Any new store agreement is for the benefit of the securitisation.' The company's management also does not have sole discretion over advertising spending, for example.

And the Dunkin' Donuts brand is no longer owned by the company.

'The sign on the wall says 'Copyright DD IP Holder LLC'. That's a bankruptcy-remote SPE set up for the benefit of noteholders [in the securitisation], Mr Hedman says.

This kind of shift might not suit all managers. But for some executives - particularly those focused on maximising cash returns to shareholders - such considerations can be outweighed by the financial benefits.

The really big players in the securitisation market are the US quasi-government bodies of Fannie Mae, $^{9}$  Ginnie Mae $^{10}$  and Freddie Mac, $^{11}$  which buy collections of mortgages from banks and issue bonds backed by the security of these mortgages (mortgage bonds or mortgage-backed securities, MBSs). They also guarantee that investors will receive timely interest and principal regardless of whether the individual mortgage payers reneg. This helps to keep down interest rates in the mortgage market. The US also has a large commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market where the flows of interest and principal payments come from companies paying off mortgages on commercial property (offices, factories, etc.). Spain (followed by Denmark) is the big player in the euro-denominated ABS market, issuing around half of them.

UK securitisations are often different to those in the rest of the world because the assets backing the securitised bonds are usually changed over the life of the securitisation – see Exhibit 6.15.

# Recent deals signal market's reopening in the same old style

FT

Jennifer Hughes

When Northern Rock decided to wind down its Granite master trust - now to be placed in the lender's "bad bank" rump - industry insiders predicted the death of a structure that had helped the UK dominate the European mortgage-backed market.

The Granite decision, in November 2008, put all bondholders in a queue for repayments that could take years, regardless of the maturity date of the paper they held.

Investors warned that they would demand far simpler structures before venturing near the sector again.

Less than a year later, however, two master-trust-backed deals in the last month have signalled the reopening of the market in the same old style.

They have reignited a debate about how best to structure an instrument considered crucial for boosting economic growth but which represents the very complexity that triggered the crisis.

Policymakers in Europe and the US have called for simpler, more transparent structures. The industry has responded with guidelines and templates for providing more data that many big issuers have agreed to follow.

But the UK, responsible for about half the total European market before the crisis, is a particular challenge because its biggest lenders use a different structure from the rest of the world.

Most mortgage-backed securitisations are based around stand-alone, ring-fenced bundles of loans.

Bonds are backed by the loans in deals known as "pass-throughs" because the mortgage repayments are passed to the bondholders almost as they happen.

This leaves investors with the risk of pre-payment - where the loans are repaid earlier than expected, meaning investors end up with extra cash they must reinvest - or of extension risk, where the bonds mature more slowly than expected.

In the UK, bankers have instead created master trusts - vast pools of mortgages which the lender would periodically top up with new loans and from which it would issue different bonds at different times.

The advantage was that this constant pool allowed the trust to issue the exact bonds investors wanted, such as ones with set maturity dates.

Investors were thereby freed from prepayment and extension risk and left only with credit risk, and the impact of any bad loans would be cushioned by the size of the whole giant mortgage pool.

# The deals have reigned a debate

on how to structure an instrument that

represents the very complexity that

triggered the crisis

Master trusts enabled the UK market to expand rapidly.

Investors liked the apparent relative simplicity of the deals. By buying bonds backed by a pool of a known quality, they saved on the effort of analysing each deal in great depth.

But the upshot of the simple front was the complexity that lurked behind the master trust.

"They have got many strong positives but one big negative, and that's the complexity," said one expert, summing up the industry's dilemma.

Because new loans are added to the existing collateral pool when new bonds are issued, the performance statistics of the older loans are diluted by the new loans."

Investors are unhappy at the way the structure leaves them at the mercy of the lender's treasury team, which can decide, under certain circumstances, not to repay the bonds until their legal maturity date.

This is further into the future than the set maturity date and reflects the long-term nature of mortgages.

In effect, this happened with Granite, where Northern Rock decided to no longer support the trust with new mortgages and where it will instead simply pay out on the existing bonds when the underlying mortgages are repaid.

"Everyone is comfortable with credit risk, but it's really also extension risk they've taken. It's not always at the issuer's discretion. They might have to extend if certain things happen."

Investor unhappiness does not appear to have yet held back the market.

Last month's 4 billion (6.5 billion) deal from Lloyds was snapped up by investors who returned this week to take 3.5 billion of paper offered by Nationwide, a deal even more notable because its Silverstone master trust was to investors.

Bankers expect more deals to follow.

"We've talked to the core investor base and most of them said we want 'master trusts,' said one banker on the Nationwide transaction.

David Basra, head of debt financing at Citigroup, argues that the UK structure is safer for investors. He helped structure the first master

# Exhibit 6.15 continued trust for Bank of Scotland and has worked on others including Abbey National, Northern Rock, Standard Life and Alliance & Leicester.

"I'd argue that stand-alone pass-through transactions may expose investors to greater credit risk, depending of course on which mortgages back their underlying bonds," he said.

"I think investors may find that they lose more over the cycle on some stand-alone deals because there is a greater chance they'll end up exposed to poorly underwritten risk."

# Covered bonds

Covered bonds are similar to securitised asset-based bonds in that a specific group of assets (e.g. mortgage receivables) is used to back up the claims of the bond holders – they have the assets acting as collateral. However, there is one crucial difference compared with ABS, which gives an extra layer of protection for investors: these assets and bonds are kept on the balance sheet of the issuing bank, which means that if the pool of assets runs into trouble (as many mortgages did in 2007–2009) investors in the covered bonds can call on the originating bank to pay up – the risk is not transferred. If an underlying loan goes bad (e.g. the mortgagee stops paying) the originating bank has to replace that loan with another. Furthermore, if it is the originating bank that runs into trouble, the investors in the covered bonds have the security of the ring-fenced assets separate from the parent. So long as the issuing institution remains solvent, the cash flows to the covered bond holders is independent of the performance of the assets. Because of their high level of backing, covered bonds are given high credit ratings (AAA) and are therefore a relatively low-cost way for financial institutions to raise money. Typical maturity ranges are 2–10 years. They are common in Europe, where they originated (in Prussia in the eighteenth century), now making up to one-third of bank debt securities. Germany has a particularly large covered bond ('Pfandbriefe') market at around €1,000 billion outstanding. Spain and France have more than €100 billion outstanding. The US market is only just getting going – see Exhibit 6.16.

# Jennifer Hughes

US proposals for a covered bond market risk wrecking the products' centuries-old reputation for boring stability, an industry group has been warned.

European banks are selling record amounts of the bonds, which have their roots in 18th-century Prussia and are backed by pools of loans that remain on a bank's books, unlike the toxic subprime securitisations the financial crisis made infamous.

The securities are considered ultra-safe because banks must replace dud loans and the pool is ring-fenced for the bondholders in bankruptcy.

A bill launched in the House of Representatives aims to give US products similar bankruptcy protection, considered vital for banks to get the low borrowing costs the bonds deliver in Europe. But the proposals allow for the US bonds to be backed by a far wider range of assets than is common in Europe, where up to four-fifths are based on high-quality mortgages.

Jens Tolckmitt, chief executive of the Association of German

Pfandbrief Banks, said that using other assets, such as student or car loans, could damage the bonds' reputation if those backed by riskier assets attracted different investors who might not hold their nerve, as investors generally did in the crisis. "European-style covered bonds are bought by a very stable investor base that likes seemingly boring products," Mr Tolckmitt said. "If you create something that appeals to hedge funds, those investors may not be there in a crisis."

European covered bond issuance

Deal value (\$bn)

European banks managed to raise funds via covered bonds throughout the crisis even as other markets froze. The bonds remain a lifeline for banks in eurozone countries whose woes have made investors wary of unsecured debt. Last week, Caja Madrid, Banesto and BBVA raised more than €3 billion (£2.6 billion) in covered bonds.

"Will it be possible to safe-guard the quality if you have covered bonds secured by other assets? I'm not sure," Mr Tolckmitt said. "It's wrong to think you name something a covered bond and it will be as well-liked and in demand as European covered bonds."

Canadian and European banks sold more than  \$30 billion (\$ 19 billion) of covered bonds to US investors in 2010. Market watchers expect that to nearly double this year.

No covered bond has reportedly defaulted, though 19th-century data are sketchy.

# Foreign bonds

A foreign bond is a bond denominated in the currency of the country where it is issued when the issuer is a non-resident.[12] For example, in Japan bonds issued by non-Japanese companies denominated in yen are foreign bonds. They are known as Samurai bonds and the interest and capital payments will be in yen. Other foreign bonds from around the world issued by nondomestic entities in the domestic market include Yankee bonds (US), Bulldog bonds (UK), Rembrandt bonds (the Netherlands), Matador bonds (Spain), Panda bonds (China), Kangaroo bonds (Australia) and Maple bonds (Canada).

Foreign bonds are regulated by the domestic authority of the country where the bond is issued. These rules can be demanding and an encumbrance to companies needing to act quickly and at low cost. The regulatory authorities have also been criticised for stifling innovation in the financial markets. The growth of the less restricted Eurobond market has put the once dominant foreign bond market in the shade.

Not all foreign bonds are issued by companies – the article in Exhibit 6.17 discusses the foreign bond issued by the Philippines government in Japan. Note the influence of LIBOR – even for deals in Japan.

# Exhibit 6.17

# Philippines set to price 1 billion of samurai bonds

FT

The Philippine government is preparing to decide on pricing for up to 1 billion of samurai bonds as early as next week as part of a plan to fund a budget deficit likely to reach a record this year.

The samurai bonds - yendentominated bonds issued by overseas entities to Japanese institutional investors - will be partially guaranteed by the state-owned Japan Bank for International

# Exhibit 6.17 continued

Cooperation, following its agreement last year to facilitate funding for some emerging economies.

JBIC has already provided such partial guarantees for samurai bonds issued last year by Indonesia, Colombia and Mexico. Indonesia has agreed with JBIC to issue 1.5 billion of samurai bonds this year.

Guarantees from JBIC will help give Japanese institutional invest tors the confidence to invest in a country whose government's credit rating is below investment grade (Moody's rates the Philippines Ba3) and buy debt with a wider spread than the highest-rated names that tap the samurai market.

The 10-year bonds are likely to have a spread of 85-95 basis points over Libor, a banker said.

That compares with 10-year samurais sold last week by Rabobank of the Netherlands, which is rated triple A by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, sold with a spread of 35bp over Libor.

# Eurobonds (international bonds)

Let's get one misunderstanding out of the way: Eurobonds are unconnected with the eurozone currency! They were in existence decades before Europe thought of creating the euro; the first Eurobond issue was in 1963 on the Luxembourg stock exchange, with the 15 million issue by Autostrade, the Italian motorway company. The term 'Euro' in Eurobond does not even mean European.

So what are they then? External bonds is a simple way of describing them. More precisely, Eurobonds are bonds sold outside the jurisdiction of the country of the currency in which the bond is denominated. So, for example, the UK financial regulators have little influence over Eurobonds issued in Luxembourg and denominated in sterling (known as Eurosterling bonds), even though the transactions (for example interest and capital payments) are in sterling. The Autostrade issue, although denominated in US dollars, was not subject to US regulations because it was issued outside the US. Bonds issued in US dollars (Eurodollar bonds) in Paris are outside the jurisdiction of the US authorities.

Eurobonds are mediumto long-term instruments with standard maturities of three, five, seven and ten years, but there are long maturities of 15–30 years driven by pension fund and insurance fund demand for long-dated assets. They are not subject to the rules and regulations which are imposed on foreign bonds, such as the requirement to issue a detailed prospectus.[13] More importantly, they are not subject to an interest-withholding tax. In many countries the majority of domestic bonds are subject to a withholding tax by which basic rate income tax is deducted before the investor receives interest. Interest on Eurobonds is paid gross without any tax deducted – which has attractions to investors keen on delaying, avoiding or evading tax.

Moreover, Eurobonds are bearer bonds, which means that the holders do not have to disclose their identity – all that is required to receive interest and capital is for the holder to have possession of the bond. Such anonymity makes it possible for holders to avoid paying tax in their own country. In contrast, domestic bonds are usually registered, which means that companies and governments are able to identify the owners. Despite the absence of official regulation, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), a self-regulatory body, imposes some restrictions, rules and standardised procedures on Eurobond issue and trading.

Eurobonds are distinct from euro bonds, which are bonds denominated in euros and issued in the Eurozone countries. Increasingly, people differentiate between the two by calling the old-style Eurobonds 'international bonds', leaving the title 'euro' for the currency introduced in 1999. Of course, there have been euro-denominated bonds issued outside the jurisdiction of the authorities in the euro area; these are Euroeurobonds.

# The development of the Eurobond (international bond) market

In the 1960s many countries (e.g. USSR), companies and individuals held surplus dollars outside the US and were reluctant to hold these funds in American banks under US jurisdiction. Also, stringent US tax laws were off-putting, as was the tough regulatory environment in the US domestic financial markets, making it more expensive for foreign institutions to borrow dollars in the US. These factors encouraged investors and borrowers alike to undertake transactions in dollars outside the US. London's strength as a financial centre, the UK authorities' more relaxed attitude to business and its position in the global time zones made it a natural leader in the Euro markets.

The market grew modestly through the 1970s and then at a rapid rate in the 1980s. By then the Eurodollar bonds had been joined by bonds denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The market was stimulated not only by the tax and anonymity benefits, which brought a lower cost of finance than for the domestic bonds, but also by the increasing demand from transnational companies and governments needing large sums in alternative currencies and with the potential for innovative characteristics. It was further boosted by the recycling of dollars from the oil-exporting countries.

In 1979 less than  \$20 billion worth of bonds were issued in a variety of currencies. The rate of new issuance has grown 100-fold to around\$ 2,000 billion a year, with a total amount outstanding (bonds issued but not yet repaid) in 2009 of over 26,000 billion – see Exhibit 6.18. Corporations account for a relatively small proportion of the international bond market. The biggest issuers are the banks. Issues by governments ('sovereign issues') and state agencies in the public sector account for less than one-tenth of issues. Other issuers are international agencies such as the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. The two dominant currencies of issue are the US dollar and the euro, with the euro generally more popular than the dollar. Even though the majority of Eurobond trading takes place through London, sterling is not one of the main currencies, and what is more, it tends to be large US and other foreign banks located in London which dominate the market.

# Types of Eurobonds

The Eurobond market has been extraordinarily innovative in producing bonds with all sorts of coupon payment and capital repayment arrangements (for example, the currency of the coupon changes halfway through the life of the bond, or the interest rate switches from fixed to floating rate at some point). We cannot go into detail here on the rich variety but merely categorise the bonds into broad types.

1 Straight fixed-rate bond The coupon remains the same over the life of the bond. These are usually paid annually, in contrast to domestic bond semi-annual coupons. The redemption of these bonds is usually made with a 'bullet' repayment at the end of the bond's life.

2 Equity related These take two forms:

(a) Bonds with warrants attached Warrants are options which give the holder the right to buy some other asset at a given price in the future. An equity warrant, for example, would give the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares. There are also warrants for commodities such as gold or oil, and for the right to buy additional bonds from the same issuer at the same price and yield as the host bond. Warrants are detachable from the host bond and are securities in their own right, unlike convertibles.

(b) Convertibles The bond holder has the right (but not the obligation) to convert the bond into ordinary shares at a preset price.

3 Floating-rate notes (FRNs) These have a variable coupon reset on a regular basis, usually every three or six months, in relation to a reference rate, such as LIBOR. The size of the spread over LIBOR reflects the perceived risk of the issuer. The typical term for an FRN is about 5-12 years.

4 Zero coupon bonds These pay no interest but are sold at a discount to their face value, so that the holder receives his gain in a lump sum at maturity. This is of benefit in countries which have different tax regimes for income (interest payments) and capital gains (the difference between the purchase and selling price of a bond).

Within these broad categories all kinds of 'bells and whistles' (features) can be attached to the bonds, for example reverse floaters – the coupon declines as LIBOR rises; capped bonds – the interest rate cannot rise above a certain level. Many bonds have call-back features under which the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the bond back after a period of time has elapsed, say five years, at a price specified when the bond was issued. This might be at the par value but is usually slightly higher. This is obviously not something bond holders favour, especially when the bond price has risen significantly above the par value. Because there are real disadvantages for investors, bonds with call features offer higher interest rates. Issuers like call features because a significant price rise for the bond implies that current market interest rates are considerably less than the coupon rate on the bond. They can buy back and issue new bonds at a lower yield. Also, some bonds place tight covenant restrictions on the firm so it is useful to be able to buy them back and issue less restrictive bonds in their place. Finally, exercising the call may permit the corporate to adjust its financial leverage by reducing its debt. Call features are often not operative for the first seven years of a long-dated bond.

A 'put' feature gives the bond holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the bond back to the issuer (usually at par value) on designated dates. It may be a valuable right if interest rates have risen, depressing the price of the bond in the market below what could be achieved by selling to the issuer. The mere existence of the right generally ensures that the price remains above par value. This extra advantage for the holder has to be paid for – usually achieved by the issuer offering a lower yield.

The majority of Eurobonds (more than 80 per cent) are rated AAA or AA, although some are issued rated below BBB-. Denominations are usually  $1,000,$ 5,000 or 50,000 (or similar large sums in the currency of issue – known as 1,000, 5,000 or 50,000 lots or pieces).

# Issuing Eurobonds

With Eurobonds, and other large bond issues, a bank (lead manager or book runner or lead underwriter), or group of banks acting for the issuer, invites a large number of other banks or other investors to buy some of the bonds. The managing group of banks may enlist a number of smaller institutions to use their extensive contacts to sell the bonds (the selling group or syndicate).[14] Eurobonds are traded on the secondary market through intermediaries acting as market makers. Most Eurobonds are listed on the London, Dublin or Luxembourg stock exchanges, but the market is primarily an over-the-counter one, that is, most transactions take place outside a recognised exchange. Most deals are conducted using the telephone, computers, telex and fax, but there are a number of electronic platforms for trading Eurobonds. The extent to which electronic platforms will replace telephone dealing is as yet unclear. It is not possible to go to a central source for price information. Most issues rarely trade. Those that do are generally private transactions between investor and bond dealer and there is no obligation to inform the public about the deal. The prices and yield on some Eurobonds are shown in Exhibits 6.7 and 6.8 on pages 236-7.

Exhibit 6.19 presents the advantages and drawbacks of Eurobonds.

Exhibit 6.20 describes the first Eurobond from 40 years ago by Autostrade, a company that continues to make use of this financial market.

# Euro medium-term notes and domestic medium-term notes

By issuing a medium-term note (MTN) a company promises to pay the holders a certain sum on the maturity date, and in many cases a coupon interest in the meantime. These instruments are typically unsecured and may carry floating or fixed interest rates. Medium-term notes have been sold with a maturity of as little as nine months and as great as 30 years, so the term is a little deceiving. They can be denominated in the domestic currency of the borrower (MTN) or in a foreign currency (Euro MTN). MTNs normally pay an interest rate above LIBOR, usually varying between 0.2 per cent and 3 per cent over LIBOR.

# Exhibit 6.19 Advantages and drawbacks of Eurobonds as a source of finance for corporations

# Advantage

# Drawback

1 Large loans for long periods are available.

2 Often cheaper than domestic bonds. The finance provider receives the interest without tax deduction and retains anonymity and therefore supplies cheaper finance. Economies of scale also reduce costs.

3 Ability to hedge interest rate and exchange rate risk, e.g. a Canadian corporation buying assets in Europe (such as a company) may finance the asset by taking on a Eurobond liability in euros, thus reducing variability in net value when expressed in Canadian dollars when the C$/€ exchange rate moves.

4 The bonds are usually unsecured. The limitations placed on management are less than those for a secured bond.

5 The lower level of regulation allows greater innovation and tailor-made financial instruments.

6 Issuance procedures are simple and bonds can be issued with speed, allowing borrowers to take advantage of an opportunity (e.g. raising money for a corporate purchase) in a timely way

7 Being outside the control of governments they cannot be frozen in an international dispute.

1 Only for the largest companies – minimum realistic issue size is about £50m.

2 Because interest and capital are paid in a foreign currency there is a risk that exchange rate movements mean more of the home currency is required to buy the foreign currency than was anticipated.

3 The secondary market can be illiquid.

# Autostrade returns to bond market after 40-year gap

FT

By Charles Batchelor and Ivar Simensen

Autostrade, the Italian motorway operator that launched the Eurobond market in 1963, is to return to the bond market this month after a gap of more than 40 years.

The company yesterday revealed plans for a bond issue worth up to €6.5 billion (\$4.5 billion) to pay off bank loans and finance a 10-year investment programme. It would be by far the largest corporate bond offering in Europe this year – ahead of issues by Britain's Network Rail and Telecom Italia.

'We go to the market once every 40 years,' joked Luca Bettonte, who was born in the year the market started and has been finance director of Autostrade since November.

'This will give us a financial structure more adapted to the needs of the group,' he added.

Autostrade is expected to issue bonds in both euros and sterling following roadshows in continental Europe, the UK and US.

It was in July 1963 that the motorway group issued a 15m (\ 9m), 15-year bond, creating a market that was to wrest control of non-US bond issues from the American investment banks and cement London's position as an international financial centre.

European banks had been relegated to an underwriting role by the

US banks that managed these issues - and hence earned much lower fees.

Siegmund Warburg founder of SG Warburg - now part of UBS the Swiss bank group - led negotiations with regulators in the UK and elsewhere to issue bonds that soaked up the large offshore dollar pool created by recurrent US balance of payments deficits.

The fledgling market received a crucial boost just  $2\frac{1}{2}$  weeks after the Autostrade issue when President John F. Kennedy announced an interest equalisation tax.

The president's aim was to improve the US balance of payments but the result was to increase the cost of US borrowing by European issuers.

The Eurobond market has gone from strength to strength, gaining further impetus from the creation of the euro in 1999 and euro-denominated issues last year overtook international dollar-denominated bonds.

The funds raised 40 years ago were intended for Finsider, the nationalised Italian steel manufacturer. Autostrade - then also state-owned - had a more favourable tax position and so was used as a channel for the funds.

Now a publicly listed company, Autostrade is 62 per cent owned by Schema Ventotto, a holding company in which the Benetton family has a 60 per cent stake.

The new issue will be managed by Barclays Capital, Caylon, Goldman Sachs, Invercaixa Valores, Mediobanca and UBM.

An MTN programme stretching over many years can be set up with one set of legal documents. Then, numerous notes can be issued under the programme in future years. A programme allows greater certainty that the firm will be able to issue an MTN when it needs the finance and allows issuers to bypass the costly and time-consuming documentation associated with each stand-alone note/bond. The programme can allow for notes of various qualities, maturities, currencies or type of interest (fixed or floating). Over the years the market can be tapped at short notice in the most suitable form at that time, e.g. US dollars rather than pounds, or redemption in three years rather than in two. It is possible to sell in small denominations, e.g. 5 million and on a continuous basis, regularly dripping notes into the market. The banks organising the MTN programme charge a commitment fee (around 10–15 basis points) for keeping open the option to borrow under an MTN programme, even if the company chooses not to do so in the end. Management fees will also be payable to the syndication of banks organising the MTN facility.

The success of an MTN programme depends on the efficiency of the lead manager and the flexibility of the issuer to match market appetite for lending in particular currencies or maturities with the issuer's demands for funds. The annual cost of running an MTN programme, excluding crediting agency fees, can be around £100,000. The cost of setting up an MTN programme is high compared with the cost of a single bond issue (and more expensive than most bank debt, except for the very best AAAAAand some A-rated companies). Many companies set one up because they believe that the initial expense is outweighed by the flexibility and cost savings that a programme can provide over time. Diageo's outstanding MTNs are shown at the start of the chapter.

# Islamic bonds (sukuk)

Sukuk (the plural form of the Arabic word Sakk from which the word cheque is derived) are bonds which conform to Shari'ah (Sharia) law, which forbids interest income, or riba. There was always a question mark over the ability of modern financing to comply with Islamic (Shari'ah) law, which not only prohibits the charging or paying of interest but insists that real assets underlie all financial transactions. Ways have been found to participate in the financial world while still keeping to Shari'ah law, although certain Islamic scholars oppose some of the instruments created.

Whereas conventional bonds are promises to pay interest and principal, sukuk represent part ownership of tangible assets, businesses or investments, so the returns are generated by some sort of share of the gain (or loss) made and the risk is shared. Money alone should not create a profit and finance should serve the real economy, not just the financial one. They are administered through an SPV which issues sukuk certificates. These certificates entitle the holder to a rental income or a profit share from the certificate. Sukuk may be issued on existing as well as other specific assets that may become available at a future date.

From inception in 1975, when the Islamic Development Bank and the Dubai Islamic Bank (the first commercial Islamic bank) were established to operate in strict accordance with Shari'ah law, Islamic banking has made significant progress worldwide, and it was estimated in 2011 that there were over \$100 billion of sukuk outstanding (and more than \$1,000 billion of Islamic finance, including bank sources).

There is some confusion over whether investors can always seize the underlying assets in the event of default on a sukuk, or whether the assets are merely placed in a sukuk structure to comply with Shari'ah law. Lawyers and bankers say that the latter is the case, with most sukuk being, in reality, unsecured instruments. They differentiate between 'asset-backed' and 'asset-based' sukuk:

- Asset-backed: there is a true sale between the originator and the SPV that issues the sukuk, and sukuk holders do not have recourse to the originator. The value of the assets owned by the SPV, and therefore the sukuk holders, may vary over time. The majority of sukuk issues are not asset backed.
- Asset-based: these are closer to conventional debt in that the sukuk holders have recourse to the originator if there is a payment shortfall.

Tesco and Toyota have both issued ringgit sukuk in Malaysia. In a further development in November 2009, General Electric (GE) became the first large western corporation to expand its investor base into this arena with the issuance of its 500 million sukuk. The assets underlying this sukuk are GE's interests in aircraft and rental payments from aircraft leasing.

# Valuing bonds

Bonds, particularly those which are traded in secondary markets such as the London Stock Exchange, are priced according to supply and demand. The main influences on the price of a bond will be the general level of interest rates for securities of that risk level and maturity and the length of time to maturity. As a bond comes closer to its maturity date, its market value comes closer to its nominal value; this is known as the pull to par, pull to maturity or pull to redemption. If the coupon rate of interest on the par value is less than the current market interest rate the bond will trade at less than the par value.

Take the case of an irredeemable bond with an annual coupon of 8 per cent. This financial asset offers to any potential purchaser a regular €80 per year for ever (i.e. 8 per cent of the par value of €1,000). When the bond was issued, general interest rates for this risk class may well have been 8 per cent and so the bond may have been sold at €1,000. However, interest rates change over time. Suppose that the current rate of interest is now 10 per cent. Investors will no longer be willing to pay €1,000 for an instrument that yields only €80 per year. The current market value of the bond will fall to €800 (€80/0.10) because this is the maximum amount needed to pay for similar bonds given the current interest rate of 10 per cent. We say that the bond is trading at a discount to its maturity value because it is trading below €1,000. If the coupon is more than the current market interest rate, the market price of the bond will be greater than the nominal (par) value. Thus, if market rates are 6 per cent, the irredeemable bond will be priced at €1,333.33 (€80/0.06). We say it is trading at a premium to its maturity value, i.e. at more than €1,000.[15] Again, notice the inverse relationship between the price of a bond and the rate of return offered on it.

The formula relating the price of an irredeemable bond, the coupon and the market rate of interest is:

$$
P _ {D} = \frac {C}{k _ {D}}
$$ where  $\mathrm{P_D} =$  price of bond


$\tilde{C} =$  nominal annual income (the coupon rate  $\times$  nominal (par) value of the bond)

${\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{D}} =$  market discount rate,annual return required on bonds of similar risk and characteristics

Also:

$$

V _ {D} = \frac {I}{k _ {D}}

$$ where  $\mathrm{V}_D =$  total market value of all of the bonds of this type

$I =$  total annual nominal interest of all the bonds of this type

We may wish to establish the market rate of interest represented by the market price of the bond. For example, if an irredeemable bond offers an annual coupon of 9.5 per cent and is currently trading at £87.50, with the next coupon due in one year, the rate of return is:

$$ k _ {D} = \frac {C}{P _ {D}} = \frac {9.5}{87.5} \times 100 = 10.86 \%
$$

# Redeemable bonds

A purchaser of a redeemable bond buys two types of income promise: first the coupon, second the redemption payment. The amount that an investor will pay depends on the amount these income flows are worth when discounted at the rate of return required on that risk class of debt. The relationships are expressed in the following formulae:

$$
P _ {D} = \frac {C _ {1}}{1 + k _ {D}} + \frac {C _ {2}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {2}} + \frac {C _ {3}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {3}} + \frac {C _ {4}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {4}} + \ldots + \frac {C _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}} + \frac {R _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}}
$$ and:


$$

V _ {D} = \frac {I _ {1}}{1 + k _ {D}} + \frac {I _ {2}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {2}} + \frac {I _ {3}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {3}} + \frac {I _ {4}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {4}} + \ldots + \frac {I _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}} + \frac {R ^ {\star} {} _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}}

$$ where  $C_1, C_2, C_3$  and  $C_4 =$  nominal interest per bond in years 1, 2, 3 and 4 up to  $n$  years

$\mathrm{I}_1, \mathrm{I}_2, \mathrm{I}_3,$  and  $\mathrm{I}_4 =$  total nominal interest in years 1, 2, 3 and 4 up to  $n$  years

$\mathrm{R}_n$  and  $\mathbf{R}^{\ast}_{n}$ $=$  redemption value of a single bond, and total redemption value of all bonds in issue in year  $n,$  the redemption or maturity date

The worked example of Blackaby illustrates the valuation of a bond when the market redemption yield is given.

# Worked example 6.1 Blackaby plc

Blackaby plc issued a bond with a par value of £100 in September 2011, redeemable in September 2017 at par. The coupon is 8 per cent payable annually in September. The facts available from this are: the bond might have a par value of £100 but this may not be what investors will pay for it;

the annual cash payment will be £8 (8 per cent of par); in September 2017, £100 will be handed over to the bond holder (in the absence of default).

# Question 1

What is the price investors will pay for this bond at the time of issue if the market rate of interest for a security in this risk class is 7 per cent?

# Answer

$$
P _ {D} = \frac {8}{1 + 0 . 0 7} + \frac {8}{(1 + 0 . 0 7) ^ {2}} + \frac {8}{(1 + 0 . 0 7) ^ {3}} + \dots + \frac {8}{(1 + 0 . 0 7) ^ {6}} + \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 7) ^ {6}}
$$

£8 annuity for 6 years @ 7 per cent = 4.7665 × 8 = 38.132

$$
\text {p l u s} \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 7) ^ {6}} = \underline {{6 6 . 6 3 4}}
$$

$$
P _ {D} = £ 104.766
$$

# Question 2

What is the bond's value in the secondary market in September 2014 if market interest rates rise by 200 basis points (i.e. for this risk class they are 9 per cent) between 2011 and 2014? (Assume the next coupon payment is in one year.)

# Answer

£8 annuity for 3 years @ 9 per cent = 2.5313 × 8 = 20.25

$$
\text {p l u s} \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 9) ^ {3}} = \underline {{7 7 . 2 2}}
$$

$$
P _ {D} = \underline {{\text {£ 9 7 . 4 7}}}
$$

Again, note that as interest rates rise, the price of bonds falls.

If we need to calculate the rate of return demanded by investors from a particular bond when we know the market price and coupon amounts, we can compute the internal rate of return (IRR).[16]

For example, Bluebird plc issued a bond many years ago which is due for redemption at par of £100 in three years. The annual coupon is 6 per cent (next one payable in one year) and the market price is £91. The rate of return now offered in the market by this bond is found by solving for  $k_{D}$ :

$$
P _ {D} = \frac {C _ {1}}{1 + k _ {D}} + \frac {C _ {2}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {2}} + \frac {C _ {3}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {3}} + \frac {R _ {3}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {3}}
$$

$$
9 1 = \frac {6}{1 + k _ {D}} + \frac {6}{\left(1 + k _ {D}\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {1 0 6}{\left(1 + k _ {D}\right) ^ {3}}
$$

We solve this problem through iteration, i.e. trial and error. Here we do this by trying one interest rate after another on paper, but there are computer programs and financial calculators which go through much the same procedure, only faster - learning the slow way helps understanding! First we will try 9 per cent, as this seems roughly right given the capital gain of around 3 per cent per year over the three years plus the 6 per cent coupon.

At an interest rate  $(k_{D})$  of 9 per cent, the right side of the equation amounts to £92.41. This is more than £91, so we conclude that we are not discounting the cash flows on the right side of the equation by a rate of return sufficiently high. At an interest rate of 10 per cent the right-hand side of the equation amounts to £90.05. This is less than the £91 we are aiming at, so the internal rate of return lies somewhere between 9 per cent and 10 per cent. We can be more precise using linear interpolation:

<table><tr><td>Interest rate</td><td>9\%</td><td>?</td><td>10\%</td></tr><tr><td>Value of discounted cash flows</td><td>£92.41</td><td>£91</td><td>£90.05</td></tr></table>

We are trying to find the value of the '?', where the cash flows on the right side are discounted at just the right rate to equal the amount paid for the bond on the left (£91).

$$ k _ {D} = 9 \% + \frac {92.41 - 91}{92.41 - 90.05} \times (10 - 9) = 9.6 \%
$$

Thus, the cash flows offered on this bond represent an average annual rate of return of 9.6 per cent on a £91 investment if the bond is held to maturity and the coupon payments are reinvested at 9.6 per cent before then. This is the yield to maturity or YTM discussed in the next section.

An Excel spreadsheet version of this calculation is available at www.pearson.com/arnold.

# The two types of yield

The current yield, $^{17}$  discussed earlier in the chapter, is the gross (before tax) interest amount divided by the current market price of the bond expressed as a percentage:

$$
\frac {\text {G r o s s i n t e r e s t (c o u p o n)}}{\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}} \times 1 0 0
$$

Thus, for a holder of Bluebird's bonds the current yield is:

$$
\frac{\text{£6}}{\text{£91}}\times 100 = 6.59\%
$$

This is a gross yield. The after-tax yield will be influenced by the investor's tax position.

Net interest yield  $=$  Gross yield  $(1 - T)$ , where  $T =$  the tax rate applicable to the bond holder

At a time when interest rates are higher than 6.59 per cent it is obvious that any potential purchaser of Bluebird bonds in the market will be looking for a return other than from the coupon. That additional return comes in the form of a capital gain over three years of  $100 -$ 91 =  $9$ . A rough estimate of this annual gain is  $(9/91) \div 3 = 3.3$  per cent per year. When this is added to the current yield we have an approximation to the second type of yield, the yield to maturity (also called the redemption yield). The yield to maturity of a bond is the discount rate such that the present value of all the cash inflows from the bond (interest plus principal) is equal to the bond's current market price. The rough estimate of 9.89 per cent (6.59 per cent + 3.3 per cent) has not taken into account the precise timing of the investor's income flows. When this is adjusted for, the yield to maturity is 9.6 per cent – the internal rate of return calculated above. Thus, the yield to maturity includes both coupon payments and the capital gain or loss on maturity.

In the Financial Times' bond tables (e.g. Exhibit 6.7 on page 236) the column headed bid yield is the yield to maturity given the current bid price (traders quote bid and offer prices; the bid is the price at which market makers will buy from investors, the offer price is what an investor would pay to buy). It is important to note that many investors sell their bonds before the redemption date. The price received depends on market conditions. If general interest rates have risen over the holding period, the bond will be worth less than if market interest rates remained constant, which will have a depressing effect on the rate of return received even though coupons may have been paid during the time the bonds were owned.

For example, if an investor bought Bluebird bonds at £91 and sold them one year later when the rate of return on two-year bonds of this risk level in the market is 10 per cent, instead of receiving the original 9.6 per cent yield to maturity they will achieve a rate of return of only 8.86 per cent over the year of holding, viz:

$$
\text {M a r k e t v a l u e o f b o n d a f t e r 1 y e a r} = \frac {6}{1 + 0 . 1} + \frac {1 0 6}{(1 + 0 . 1) ^ {2}} = 9 3. 0 6
$$

$$
\text{Thus, the return to our investor is:} 91 = \frac {93.06 + 6}{1 + r} \quad r = 8.86 \%
$$

# Semi-annual interest

The example of Bluebird is based on the assumption of annual interest payments. This makes initial understanding easier and reflects the reality for many types of bond, particularly internationally traded bonds. However, many companies and governments around the world issue domestic bonds with semi-annual interest payments. The rate of return calculation on these bonds is slightly more complicated.

For example, Redwing has an 11 per cent bond outstanding which pays interest semi-annually. It will be redeemed in two years at €100 and has a current market price of €96, with the next interest payment due in six months. The yield to maturity on this bond is calculated as follows:

Cash flows

Point in time (years) 0.5 1 1.5 2 Cash flow €5.5 €5.5 €5.5 + £100

The nominal interest rate over a six-month period is 5.5 per cent (11\%/2):

9 6 = \frac {5 . 5 0}{1 + \frac {k _ {D}}{2}} + \frac {5 . 5 0}{\left(1 + \frac {k _ {D}}{2}\right) ^ {2}} + \frac {5 . 5 0}{\left(1 + \frac {k _ {D}}{2}\right) ^ {3}} + \frac {5 . 5 0}{\left(1 + \frac {k _ {D}}{2}\right) ^ {4}} + \frac {1 0 0}{\left(1 + \frac {k _ {D}}{2}\right) ^ {4}}
$$

At a rate of 6 per cent for  $k_{D} / 2$  the right-hand side equals:

$$
5. 5 0 \times 4 - p e r i o d a n n u i t y @ 6 p e r c e n t = 5. 5 0 \times 3. 4 6 5 1 = 1 9. 0 5 8
$$

$$
\text {p l u s} \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 6) ^ {4}} = \frac {7 9 . 2 0 9}{\underline {{\epsilon}} 9 8 . 2 6 7}
$$

At a rate of 7 per cent for  $k_{D} / 2$  the right-hand side equals:

$$
5. 5 0 \times 4 - p e r i o d a n n u i t y @ 7 p e r c e n t = 5. 5 0 \times 3. 3 8 7 2 = 1 8. 6 3 0
$$

$$
\text {p l u s} \frac {1 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 0 7) ^ {4}} = \frac {7 6 . 2 9 0}{\underline {{\epsilon 9 4 . 9 2 0}}}
$$

The IRR of the cash flow equals:  $6\% + \frac{98.267 - 96}{98.267 - 94.92} \times (7 - 6) = 6.68\%$

The IRR needs to be converted from a half-yearly cash flow basis to an annual basis:

$$
(1 + 0.0668)^{2} - 1 = 0.1381\text{or} 13.81\%
$$

# Yield to maturity versus rate of return

It is important to understand the difference between yield to maturity and rate of return that an individual investor in a bond receives if they sell before the maturity date. Assume that Tom has just bought four bonds. The maturity dates are one year from now, five years from now, ten years from now and twenty years from now. For the sake of simplicity assume that all the bonds are trading in the secondary market at €1,000, which is also their par values to be paid at maturity, and that they each offer a yield to maturity of 6 per cent (annual coupons are €60).

Tom is planning to sell the bonds in a year from now. The question is, what rate of return will he receive if between now and then the yield to maturity investors demand in the secondary market on these bonds rises from 6 per cent to 10 per cent? (Again, assume for the sake of simplicity that the yield to maturity of 10 per cent is the same regardless of whether the bond has a short or a long time until maturity – there is a 'flat yield curve' as discussed later.)

In the case of the one-year bond Tom does not have to sell in the secondary market; the issuer redeems the bond at its par value of €1,000. Tom also receives the coupon of €60, so the rate of return he gains is 6 per cent. This is the same as the yield to maturity when he bought.

There is a general rule for bonds: the yield to maturity and the rate of return are equal only when the time to maturity is the same as the holding period. We can illustrate this with the five-tenand twenty-year bonds.

# For the five-year bond:

Rate of return over the one-year holding period,  $r = \frac{C + P_{t+1} - P_t}{P_t} \times 100$ where, C = coupon

$\mathrm{P}_{t + 1} =$  price of bond after one year

$\mathrm{P_t}$ $=$  price of bond at the start.

Thus, there is an interest element (C) plus a capital gain or loss  $(\mathrm{(P_{t + 1} - P_t) / P_t)}$  element to the rate of return.

To calculate  $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{t + 1}}$  ..

$\mathrm{P}_{t + 1} =$  four annual coupons discounted to time  $t + 1$ $(€60\times)$  annuity factor for four years at  $10\%$  plus the redemption amount discounted back to  $t + 1$

$$
\epsilon 6 0 \times 3. 1 6 9 9 \quad = \quad 1 9 0. 1 9
$$

$$
\frac {1 0 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 1) ^ {4}} \quad = \quad 6 8 3. 0 1
$$

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {\mathrm {t} + 1} \quad = \quad \underline {{8 7 3 . 2 0}}
$$

Rate of return,  $r = \frac{60 + 873.20 - 1000}{1000} \times 100 = -6.7\%$

So, while the yield to maturity at time  $t$  was 6 per cent, the rate of return over the one-year holding period was -6.7 per cent because of the large capital loss on the bond.

It is even worse for the ten-year and twenty-year bonds. If yields to maturity rise from 6 per cent to 10 per cent over the holding year then these bonds can be sold for only €769.64 and €665.40 at time  $t + 1$ :

# Ten-year bond:

Rate of return,  $r = \frac{C + P_{t+1} - P_t}{P_t} \times 100$

$\mathrm{P}_{t + 1}$  with 9 annual coupons, 10 per cent discount rate:

$$
\epsilon 6 0 \times 5. 7 5 9 \quad = \quad 3 4 5. 5 4
$$

$$
\frac {1 0 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 1) ^ {9}} \quad = \quad 4 2 4. 1 0
$$

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {\mathrm {t} + 1} \quad = \quad \overline {{\epsilon 7 6 9 . 6 4}}
$$

Rate of return,  $r = \frac{60 + 769.64 - 1000}{1000} \times 100 = -17\%$

# Twenty-year bond:

Rate of return,  $r = \frac{C + P_{t+1} - P_t}{P_t} \times 100$

$\mathrm{P}_{t + 1}$  with 19 annual coupons, 10 per cent discount rate:

$$
\epsilon 6 0 \times 8. 3 6 4 9 \quad = \quad 5 0 1. 8 9
$$

$$
\frac {\epsilon 1 0 0 0}{(1 + 0 . 1) ^ {1 9}} \quad = \quad 1 6 3. 5 1
$$

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {\mathrm {t} + 1} \quad = \quad \overline {{\epsilon 6 6 5 . 4 0}}
$$

Rate of return,  $r = \frac{60 + 665.4 - 1000}{1000} \times 100 = 27.5\%$

Table 6.2 Summary table for Tom's bonds

<table><tr><td>Years to maturity when first purchased</td><td>Initial yield to maturity</td><td>Price at time t €</td><td>Price at time t+1 €</td><td>Capital loss</td><td>Rate of return</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>6\%</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000.00</td><td>0.0</td><td>6.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6\%</td><td>1,000</td><td>873.20</td><td>-126.80</td><td>-6.7\%</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>6\%</td><td>1,000</td><td>769.64</td><td>-230.36</td><td>-17.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>6\%</td><td>1,000</td><td>665.40</td><td>-334.60</td><td>-27.5\%</td></tr></table>

Of course, if each of the bonds is held until maturity, Tom will receive a 6 per cent rate of return. Also, perhaps we are forgetting the potential upside: if yields to maturity for these bonds in the secondary market fall during the year, Tom makes a capital gain if he sells. Again, we have an illustration of the inverse relationship between the price of a bond and the yield to maturity. We also have the (when first encountered) counter-intuitive result that a rise in interest rates results in a poor bond investment – Tom will not be happy with the return on his bonds.

# Volatility of bond returns

The Tom example also demonstrates how volatility changes with time to maturity. The most volatile bond is the one stretching for 20 years – its price is very sensitive to market interest rates. We say there is a large amount of interest rate risk. The degree of price change is much smaller for the five-year bond and non-existent for the one-year bond (although there would be some impact of market interest rate changes if the one-year bond was sold in a few months rather than after the whole year is out).

Rates of returns and prices for long-term bonds are more volatile than they are for short-term bonds (holding all other factors constant).

This means that if the investor has a time horizon of only a year or two, long-term bonds may be seen as risky investments - even if they have very low default risk, they have high interest rate risk.

It is not uncommon for long-term bonds to lose 5 per cent of their value in a year, even if they are reputable government bonds – see Exhibit 6.21.

# Duration

The duration of a bond can give us a guide on the amount of interest rate risk it is carrying relative to other bonds. The duration metric is a summary measure of how far into the future is the average date of the cash flows to be received, when the cash flows are weighted by their size after they have been discounted. In other words:

The duration of a bond is the weighted average maturity of all payments (coupons plus principal) to be received from owning a bond, where the weights are the discounted present values of the payments.

So, for zero coupon bonds the effective duration is the same as its actual term to maturity – the 'average' maturity time is the same as the final payout (the only cash flow received). So, a three-year zero coupon bond has a duration of three years. For coupon-paying bonds the duration is shorter than the stated term to maturity because as the years go by the investor receives income from the bond which pushes the weighted average maturity of income flows more towards the start date than is the case on a zero coupon bond.

A three-year coupon-paying bond offering £7 per year (with the first in one year from now) and £100 on maturity can be seen as having cash flows equal to the following three zero coupon bonds:

A one-year zero coupon bond paying £7 in one year

A two-year zero coupon bond paying £7 in two years

A three-year zero coupon bond paying £107 in three years

If the present yields to maturity for bonds of this risk class are also 7 per cent then the duration can be calculated - see Table 6.3.

Table 6.3 Calculating duration on a three-year 7 per cent coupon bond

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Coupon and principal (zero coupon bonds)</td><td>Present value (PV) if discounted at 7\% (the current market YTM)</td><td>Weights (\% of total present value)</td><td>Weighted maturity (Period × weights ÷100). In years</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>£7</td><td>£6.54</td><td>£6.54 ÷ £100 = 6.54\%</td><td>1 × 0.0654 = 0.0654</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>£7</td><td>£6.11</td><td>£6.12 ÷ £100 = 6.11\%</td><td>2 × 0.0611 = 0.1224</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>£107</td><td>£87.34</td><td>£87.34 ÷ £100 = 87.34\%</td><td>3 × 0.8734 = 2.6202</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>100.00\%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Total present value</td><td>£100.00</td><td>DURATION</td><td>2.8078 years</td></tr></table>

As we might expect, the duration of 2.8078 years is almost as much as the time to maturity, but it is lowered from full three years because some of the income is received before the end of three years. This three-year 7 per cent coupon bond has the same duration as a 2.8078-year zero coupon bond also yielding 7 per cent.

# Duration if the term to maturity is lengthened

If we now look at a four-year bond offering £7 per year when the yield to maturity is 7 per cent we expect to find its duration greater than that on the three-year bond – see Table 6.4.

Table 6.4 Calculating duration on a four-year 7 per cent coupon bond

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Coupon and principal (zero coupon bonds)</td><td>Present value (PV) if discounted at 7\%</td><td>Weights (\% of total present value)</td><td>Weighted maturity (Period × weights ÷100). In years</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>£7</td><td>£6.54</td><td>£6.54 ÷ £100 = 6.54\%</td><td>1 × 0.0654 = 0.0654</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>£7</td><td>£6.11</td><td>£6.11 ÷ £100 = 6.11\%</td><td>2 × 0.0611 = 0.1222</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>£7</td><td>£5.71</td><td>£5.71 ÷ £100 = 5.71\%</td><td>3 × 0.0571 = 0.1713</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>£107</td><td>£81.63</td><td>£81.63 ÷ £100 = 81.63\% /100.00\%</td><td>4 × 0.8163 = 3.2652</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Total present value</td><td>£100.00</td><td>DURATION</td><td>3.6241 years</td></tr></table>

This illustrates a general rule:

Holding other factors constant, the longer the term to maturity of a bond, the longer its duration.

# Duration and changes in yield to maturity

The time to maturity of a bond is not enough on its own to tell you what its volatility level is. Thus, all four-year bonds do not have the same duration (say, 3.6241 years). This can be illustrated using the four-year bond example again, keeping everything the same except that the yield to maturity is now 10 per cent. Thus, we discount the future cash flows at the higher discount rate of 10 per cent, not 7 per cent – see Table 6.5.

Table 6.5 Calculating duration on a four-year 7 per cent coupon bond when the yield to maturity is 10 per cent

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Coupon and principal (zero coupon bonds)</td><td>Present value (PV) if discounted at 10\%</td><td>Weights (\% of total present value)</td><td>Weighted maturity (Period × weights ÷100). In years</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>£7</td><td>£6.36</td><td>£6.36 ÷ £90.49 = 7.03\%</td><td>1 × 0.0703 = 0.0703</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>£7</td><td>£5.79</td><td>£5.79 ÷ £90.49 = 6.40\%</td><td>2 × 0.0640 = 0.1280</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>£7</td><td>£5.26</td><td>£5.26 ÷ £90.49 = 5.81\%</td><td>3 × 0.0581 = 0.1743</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>£107</td><td>£73.08</td><td>£73.08 ÷ £90.49 = 80.76\%</td><td>4 × 0.8076 = 3.2304</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>100.00\%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Total present value</td><td>£90.49</td><td>DURATION</td><td>3.603 years</td></tr></table>

With the interest rate at 10 per cent duration has fallen from 3.6241 years to 3.603 years. This is because at the higher interest rate the more distant cash flows are discounted more heavily and thus contribute a lower overall proportion of the overall discounted cash flows – the nearer-term cash flows gain relative weight as the duration reduces.

This illustrates another rule:

If interest rates rise, the duration falls (keeping everything else constant).

# Duration if coupons increase

If we take two bonds, both with the same the yield to maturity but one has higher coupons, then the duration will be lower on that bond, resulting in a bond with less volatility or interest rate risk. To illustrate we can go back to example of the four-year bond above with a yield to maturity of 7 per cent (Table 6.4). We can compare its duration with that for another bond with the same yield to maturity but with the following pattern of cash flows:

Current market price  $= \text{£144.03}$

Four annual coupons of £20

Par (nominal) value to be redeemed in four years  $= \text{£100}$

Table 6.6 Calculating duration on a four-year 20 per cent coupon bond when the yield to maturity remains at 7 per cent

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Coupon and principal (zero coupon bonds)</td><td>Present value (PV) if discounted at 7\%</td><td>Weights (\% of total present value)</td><td>Weighted maturity (Period × weights ÷100). In years</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>£20</td><td>£18.69</td><td>£18.69 ÷ £144.03 = 12.98\%</td><td>1 × 0.1298 = 0.1298</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>£20</td><td>£17.47</td><td>£17.47 ÷ £144.03 = 12.13\%</td><td>2 × 0.1213 = 0.2426</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>£20</td><td>£16.32</td><td>£16.32 ÷ £144.03 = 11.33\%</td><td>3 × 0.1133 = 0.3399</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>£120</td><td>£91.55</td><td>£91.55 ÷ £144.03 = 63.56\%</td><td>4 × 0.6356 = 2.5424</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>100.00\%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Total present value</td><td>£144.03</td><td>DURATION</td><td>3.2547 years</td></tr></table>

The bond with £20 coupons has a shorter duration, at 3.2547 years, than the bond with the £7 coupon, at 3.6241 years, despite the yield to maturity and time to maturity remaining the same. Thus we come to another rule:

The higher the coupon rate on the bond, the shorter the bond's duration.

# Using duration as a guide to interest rate risk

As duration increases, the percentage change in the market value of a bond increases for a given change in interest rates, i.e. interest rate risk rises with duration. Thus, we can use duration as a measure of interest rate risk. It is not a perfect measure, but it does provide a good approximation (when interest rate changes are small) of the extent to which the price of a bond will change if yields to maturity rise or fall – as expressed in the following formula:

Percentage change in bond price from one period to the next  $\approx$  -Duration  $\times \frac{\text{change in YTM}}{1 + \text{YTM}}$

For example, if an investor is holding the four-year bond yielding 7 per cent at time t in Table 6.4 with a duration of 3.6241 years, you could ask how much would the price of the bond change if interest rates (YTM) rose by 1 per cent?

Answer:

Change in interest rate  $= 0.01$

Current YTM  $= 0.07$

Change in bond price  $\approx -3.6241 \times \frac{0.01}{1 + 0.07} = -0.0339 = -3.39\%$

Thus, for a 1 per cent change in market interest rates this bond's price moves by roughly 3.39 per cent.[19] We can compare this degree of sensitivity to interest rate changes with other bonds. Let us take the four-year bond in Table 6.6 offering 20 per cent coupons for a YTM of 7 per cent. It has a duration of 3.2547 years.

Change in bond price  $\approx -3.2547 \times \frac{0.01}{1 + 0.07} = -0.0304 = -3.04\%$

Clearly, this bond carries less interest rate risk than the 7 per cent coupon bond, as its price changes by only 3.04 per cent when yields change by 1 per cent. The lower duration and therefore lower interest rate risk, but same yield to maturity, on the 20 per cent coupon bond may induce an investor to switch investment funds from the more risky bond (7 per cent coupon) to this less risky one.

# Demand and supply curves for bonds

The prices of bonds in the market respond in the same way as other assets to shifts in demand and supply. Here we look at the main influences causing those shifts. First, we need to draw the distinction between a movement along a curve and a shift in the entire curve - see Exhibit 6.22.

A movement along a demand curve means that investors are responding to price changes (which, of course, relate directly to YTM). For each given price they demand a particular quantity – as prices rise, demand falls. For movements along the supply curve, issuers supply more bonds if the price rises – meaning that the YTM is falling. Equilibrium is reached where the supply and demand curves intersect.

There are some factors that shift the entire curve. Thus, for every given price there is a new quantity demanded or supplied - see Exhibits 6.23 and 6.24 for the main factors.

If we move the focus from bonds taken as a group to particular bonds or a class of bonds then we have some other factors influencing demand: (a) the interest rate offered on other bonds, and (b) a change in perception on the risk of the bond defaulting relative to other bonds. The YTM being offered on other bonds also affects the supply curve for a particular bond or a class of bonds.

# The term structure of interest rates

It is not safe to assume that the yield to maturity on a bond remains the same regardless of the length of time of the loan. So, if the interest rate on a three-year bond is 7 per cent per year it may or may not be 7 per cent on a five-year bond of the same risk class. Lenders in the financial markets demand different interest rates on loans of differing lengths of time to maturity – that is, there is a term structure of the interest rates. Four of these relationships are shown in Exhibit 6.25 for lending to the UK, Eurozone, Japanese and US governments.[20] Note that default (and liquidity) risk remains constant along one of the lines; the reason for the different rates is the time to maturity of the bonds. Thus, a two-year US government bond has to offer about 1 per cent whereas a ten-year bond offered by the same borrower gives about 3.7 per cent. Note that the yield curve for the eurozone is only for the most creditworthy governments which have adopted the euro (e.g. Germany). Less safe governments had to pay a lot more in 2010 as investors worried whether they would default.

An upward-sloping yield curve occurs in most years, but 2010 demonstrated an extreme upward slope because governments and central banks around the world forced down short-term interest rates to try to reflate their economies. Occasionally we have a situation where short-term interest rates (lending for, say, one year) exceed those of long-term interest rates (say, a 20-year bond). A downward-sloping term structure (yield curve inversion) and a flat yield curve are shown in Exhibit 6.26.

Exhibit 6.26 Upward sloping, downward sloping and flat yield curves

Three main hypotheses have been advanced to explain the shape of the yield curve (these are not mutually exclusive – all three can operate at the same time to influence the yield curve):

(a) the expectations hypothesis;

(b) the liquidity-preference hypothesis; and

(c) the market-segmentation hypothesis.

# The expectations hypothesis

The expectations hypothesis focuses on the changes in interest rates over time. To understand the expectations hypothesis you need to know what is meant by a spot rate of interest. The spot rate is an interest rate fixed today on a loan that is made today. So a corporation, Hype plc, might issue one-year bonds at a spot rate of, say, 8 per cent, two-year bonds at a spot rate of 8.995 per cent and three-year bonds at a spot rate of 9.5 per cent. This yield curve for Hype is shown in Exhibit 6.27. The interest rates payable by Hype are bound to be greater than for the UK government across the yield curve because of the additional default risk on these corporate bonds.

Exhibit 6.27 The term structure of interest rates for Hype plc at time 2010

Spot rates change over time. The market may have allowed Hype to issue one-year bonds yielding 8 per cent at a point in time in 2010, but a year later (time 2011) the one-year spot rate may have changed to become 10 per cent. If investors expect that one-year spot rates will become 10 per cent at time 2011 they will have a theoretical limit on the yield that they require from a two-year bond when viewed from time 2010. Imagine that an investor (lender) wishes to lend £1,000 for a two-year period and is contemplating two alternative approaches:

1 Buy a one-year bond at a spot rate of 8 per cent; after one year has passed the bond will come to maturity. The released funds can then be invested in another one-year bond at a spot rate of 10 per cent, expected to be the going rate for bonds of this risk class at time 2011.

2 Buy a two-year bond at the spot rate at time 2010.

Under the first option the lender will have a sum of £1,188 at the end of two years:

$$
£ 1, 0 0 0 (1 + 0. 0 8) = £ 1, 0 8 0
$$

$$
\text {f o l l o w e d} \mathfrak {L} 1, 0 8 0 (1 + 0. 1) = \mathfrak {L} 1, 1 8 8
$$

Given the anticipated change in one-year spot rates to 10 per cent the investor will buy the two-year bond only if it gives the same average annual yield over two years as the first option of a series of one-year bonds. The annual interest required will be:

$$
£ 1, 0 0 0 (1 + k) ^ {2} = £ 1, 1 8 8
$$

$$ k = \sqrt {(1 , 1 8 8 / 1 , 0 0 0)} - 1 = 0. 0 8 9 9 5 \text {o r} 8. 9 9 5 \text {p e r c e n t}
$$

Thus, it is the expectation of spot interest rates changing which determines the shape of the yield curve according to the expectations hypothesis.

Now consider a downward-sloping yield curve where the spot rate on a one-year instrument is 11 per cent and the expectation is that one-year spot rates will fall to 8 per cent the following year. An investor considering a two-year investment will obtain an annual yield of 9.49 per cent by investing in a series of one-year bonds, viz:

$$
£ 1, 0 0 0 (1. 0 8) (1. 1 1) = £ 1, 1 9 8. 8 0
$$

$$ k = \sqrt {(1 1 9 8 . 8 / 1 , 0 0 0)} - 1 = 0. 0 9 4 9 \text {o r} 9. 4 9 \text {p e r c e n t p e r y e a r}
$$

$$
\mathrm {o r} \sqrt {(1 . 0 8) (1 . 1 1)} - 1 = 0. 0 9 4 9
$$

With this expectation for movements in one-year spot rates, lenders will demand an annual rate of return of 9.49 per cent from two-year bonds of the same risk class.

Thus, in circumstances where short-term spot interest rates are expected to fall, the yield curve will be downward sloping.

# Worked example 6.2 Spot rates

If the present spot rate for a one-year bond is 5 per cent and for a two-year bond 6.5 per cent, what is the expected one-year spot rate in a year's time?*

# Answer

If the two-year rate is set to equal the rate on a series of one-year spot rates then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 + 0. 0 5) (1 + x) = (1 + 0. 0 6 5) ^ {2} \\ x = \frac {(1 + 0 . 0 6 5) ^ {2}}{1 + 0 . 0 5} - 1 = 0. 0 8 0 2 \text {o r} 8. 0 2 \text {p e r c e n t} \\ \end{array}
$$

*In the financial markets it is possible to agree now to lend money in one year's time for, say, a year (or two years or six months, etc.) at a rate of interest agreed at the outset. This is a 'forward'.

# The liquidity-preference hypothesis

The expectations hypothesis does not adequately explain why the most common shape of the yield curve is upward sloping. The liquidity-preference hypothesis (liquidity premium theory) helps explain the upward slope by pointing out that investors require an extra return for lending on a long-term basis. Lenders demand a premium return on long-term bonds compared with short-term instruments because of greater interest rate risk and the risk of misjudging future interest rates. Putting your money into a ten-year bond on the anticipation of particular levels of interest rates exposes you to the possibility that rates will rise above the rate offered on the bond at some point in its long life. Thus, if five years later interest rates double, say because of a rise in inflation expectations, the market price of the bond will fall substantially, leaving the holder with a large capital loss. By investing in a series of one-year bonds, however, the investor can take advantage of rising interest rates as they occur. The ten-year bond locks in a fixed rate for the full ten years if held to maturity. Investors prefer short-term bonds so that they can benefit from rising rates and so will accept a lower return on short-dated instruments. The liquidity-preference theory focuses on a different type of risk attaching to long-dated debt instruments other than default risk – a risk related to uncertainty over future interest rates. A suggested reinforcing factor to the upward slope is that borrowers usually prefer long-term debt because of the fear of having to repay short-term debt at inappropriate moments. Thus, borrowers increase the supply of long-term debt instruments, adding to the tendency for long-term rates to be higher than short-term rates.

Note that the word liquidity in the title is incorrectly used, but it has stuck so we still use it. Liquidity refers to the speed and ease of the sale of an asset. In the case of long-term bonds (especially government bonds), sale in the secondary market is often as quick and easy as for short-term bonds. The premium for long bonds is compensation for the extra risk of capital loss; 'term premium' might be a better title for the hypothesis.

# The market-segmentation hypothesis

The market-segmentation hypothesis argues that the debt market is not one homogeneous whole, that there are, in fact, a number of sub-markets defined by maturity range. The yield curve is therefore created (or at least influenced) by the supply and demand conditions in each of these sub-markets. For example, banks tend to be active in the short-term end of the market and pension funds to be buyers in the long-dated segment.

If banks need to borrow large quantities quickly they will sell some of their short-term instruments, increasing the supply on the market, pushing down the price and raising the yield. Meanwhile pension funds may be flush with cash and may buy large quantities of 20-year bonds, helping to temporarily move yields downwards at the long end of the market. At other times banks, pension funds and the buying and selling pressures of a multitude of other financial institutions will influence the supply and demand position in the opposite direction. The point is that the players in the different parts of the yield curve tend to be different. This hypothesis helps to explain the often lumpy or humped yield curve.

# A final thought on the term structure of interest rates

It is sometimes thought that in circumstances of a steeply rising yield curve it would be advantageous to borrow short term rather than long term. However, this can be a dangerous strategy because long-term debt may be trading at a higher rate of interest because of the expected rise in spot short-term rates and so when the borrower comes to refinance in, say, a year's time, the short-term interest rate is much higher than the long-term rate and this high rate has to be paid out of the second year's cash flows, which may not be convenient.

# Concluding comments

Governments and companies around the world have learned of the enormous power of the bond markets. James Carville, President Clinton's political adviser, once said: 'I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.'

He had experienced the great difficulties politicians often have in going against the logic of bond investors. President Clinton tried to increase the gap between what the US government spends and what it raises in taxes. The administration expected to fill the gap by borrowing in the bond markets. But investors started to sell bonds, raising the yields as they worried about all the additional borrowing and the risk of higher inflation in the economy. The president was forced to abandon the strategy and instead balance the government budget.

In 2011 many governments were desperately dependent on the availability of money in the bond markets to allow them to spend one-third or more than they raised in taxes. If there was any hint of a government not being able to repay because it had over-borrowed or that inflation was about to take off, investors refused to continue supplying new bond finance or pushed up the yields they required. This had a very sobering, indeed intimidating, effect on the politicians.

The bond markets had a major role to play in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2008, with securitised bonds and derivatives of securitised bonds at the heart of the matter. Then, in the recovery, companies queued up to sell new bonds to raise cash as they fought to survive the economic downturn. Without the bond markets being willing to supply those funds, some of our leading companies would have met their demise; after all, the banks were not willing/able to lend and equity investors were scared.

These are just a few examples that clearly demonstrate the value of developing an understanding of these markets and appreciation of the tremendous power of the collective will of the participants. I hope this chapter has provided a base for continued learning about the markets and their influences on all our lives.

# Key points and concepts
- A bond is a long-term contract in which the bond holders lend money to a company, government or some other issuing organisation. A straight 'vanilla' bond pays regular interest plus the capital on the redemption date.
- Bond investors in corporate bonds are exposed to less risk than share investors because they have the right to receive the annual interest before the equity holders receive any dividend and often have rights to seize company assets if the company reneges. But the bond holders do not (usually) share in the increase in value created by an extraordinarily successful business and there is an absence of any voting power over the management of the company.
Gilts are UK government bonds, issued via the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) and are normally sold with a nominal (face or par or maturity) value of £100.
Bond prices and redemption yields move in opposite directions.
Gilt-edged market makers (GEMMS) are prepared to buy from, or sell gilts to, investors. The bid price is the price at which they will buy, the offer price is their selling price.
If you buy a bond cum-dividend you will receive the next coupon paid.
- Bonds are quoted at clean prices, without taking account of the accrued interest. A buyer will pay the clean price plus the accrued interest value (called the dirty price or full price or invoice price) and receives all of the next coupon.
- Dirty price = Clean price +  $\frac{\text{Annual coupon}}{2} \times \frac{\text{Number of days since last coupon}}{\text{Number of days separating coupon payments}}$
- If you buy during the ex-dividend period the person you bought from will receive the accrued interest from the issuer.
- Index-linked stocks (gilts): the coupon amount, and the nominal value, are adjusted or uplifted according to inflation.
- US Treasury notes are issued on behalf of the US government by Treasury Direct with a face value of 100 and a coupon payable every six months and maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years. US Treasury bonds are auctioned quarterly, have a maturity date of 10 to 30 years and pay interest twice per year. US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are index-linked bonds whose principal value is adjusted according to changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Corporate bonds generally offer a higher rate of return than government bonds with more risk. The majority of trading occurs in the over-the-counter (OTC) market in thin secondary markets.
- Straight, plain vanilla or bullet bonds: regular (usually semi-annual or annual) fixed coupons and a specified redemption date.
- Debentures are generally more secure than loan stock (in the UK and some other countries).
- A trust deed (or bond indenture) has affirmative covenants outlining the nature of the bond contract and negative (restrictive) covenants impose constraints on managerial action to reduce risk for the lenders.
- A floating rate note (FRN) (variable rate note/bond) is a bond with an interest rate which varies as a benchmark interest rate changes (e.g. LIBOR).
- A credit rating depends on (a), the likelihood of payments of interest and/or capital not being paid (i.e. default); and (b), the extent to which the lender is protected in the event of a default.
- High-yield bonds are forms of debt offering a high return with a high risk.
- Local authority and municipal bonds ('Munis') are bonds issued by governments at a sub-national level, such as a county, city or state, which pay a fixed rate of interest and are repayable on a specific future date.
- Convertible bonds are issued as debt instruments but they also give the holder the right to exchange the bonds at some time in the future into ordinary shares according to some prearranged formula. Advantages for corporate issuers are:
- lower interest than on debentures;
- interest is tax deductible;
- they are self liquidating;
- there are few negative covenants;
- shares might be temporarily underpriced;
- it is a cheap way to issue shares;
- they are an available form of finance when straight debt and equity are not.
- Strips are bonds which are broken down into their individual cash flows. The dividends or coupons are separated from the bond and are then negotiable zero coupon instruments in their own right with a fixed maturity date.
- Asset backed securitisation involves the pooling and repackaging of relatively small, homogeneous and illiquid financial assets into liquid securities.
Covered bonds are similar to securitised asset-backed bonds in that a group of assets (e.g. mortgage receivables) are used to back up the claims of the bond holders, but these assets and bonds are kept on the balance sheet of the issuing bank, thus investors can call on the originating bank to pay up.
- A foreign bond is a bond denominated in the currency of the country where it is issued, when the issuer is a non-resident.
- Eurobonds are bonds sold outside the jurisdiction of the country of the currency in which the bond is denominated. They are bearer bonds not subject to withholding tax.
- Call back features: the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the bond back after a period of time has elapsed, say five years, at a price specified when the bond was issued.
A 'Put' feature gives the bondholder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the bond back to the issuer (usually at par value) on designated dates.
Medium-term notes (MTNs). A note (contract) under which a company promises to pay the holders a certain sum on the maturity date, and in many cases a coupon interest in the meantime. Typically unsecured, carrying floating or fixed interest rates, and sold with a maturity of as little as nine months and as great as 30 years. An MTN programme stretching over many years can be set up with one set of legal documents. Then, numerous notes can be issued under the programme in future years.
- Sukuk bonds are bonds conforming to Shari'ah law, which forbids interest income, or riba, and insists that real assets underlie all financial transactions. Sukuk represent part ownership of tangible assets, businesses or investments, so the returns are generated by some sort of share of the gain (or loss) made and the risk is shared.
- A bond is priced according to general market interest rates for risk class and maturity: Irredeemable:

$$
P _ {D} = \frac {C}{k _ {D}} \quad \text {a n d :} V _ {D} = \frac {I}{k _ {D}}
$$

Redeemable:

$$
P _ {D} = \frac {C _ {1}}{1 + k _ {D}} + \frac {C _ {2}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {2}} + \frac {C _ {3}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {3}} + \frac {C _ {4}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {4}} + \dots + \frac {C _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}} + \frac {R _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}}
$$ and:


$$

V _ {D} = \frac {I _ {1}}{1 + k _ {D}} + \frac {I _ {2}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {2}} + \frac {I _ {3}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {3}} + \frac {I _ {4}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {4}} + \ldots + \frac {I _ {n}}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}} + \frac {R ^ {\star} n}{(1 + k _ {D}) ^ {n}}

$$
- The current (interest) yield on a bond is:

$$

\frac {\text {G r o s s i n t e r e s t (c o u p o n)}}{\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}} \times 1 0 0

$$
- The yield to maturity includes both annual coupon returns and capital gains or losses on maturity. It is the discount rate such that the present value of all the cash inflows from the bond (interest plus principal) is equal to the bond's current market price.
- Interest rate risk is the extent to which the price of a bond changes when general market yields change for that risk class of bonds. The volatility of long dated bond tends to be greater than short dated ones.
The duration of a bond is the weighted average maturity of all payments (coupons plus principal) to be received from owning a bond, where the weights are the discounted present values of the payments.
Percentage change in bond price from one period to the next  $\approx$  -Duration  $\times \frac{\text{Change in YTM}}{1 + \text{YTM}}$
- Factors that shift the demand curve for bonds: expected inflation, riskiness of bonds relative to other assets, wealth, liquidity of bonds relative to other assets.
- The main factors that shift the supply curve for bonds: expected inflation, availability of profitable investment opportunities, size of government borrowing.
The term structure of interest rates describes the manner in which the same default risk class of debt securities provides different rates of return depending on the length of time to maturity. There are three hypotheses relating to the term structure of interest rates: the expectations hypothesis;
- the liquidity-preference hypothesis;
- the market-segmentation hypothesis.

# Questions and problems

1 Imagine that the market yield to maturity for three-year bonds in a particular risk class is 12 per cent. You buy a bond in that risk class which offers an annual coupon of 10 per cent for the next three years, with the first payment in one year. The bond will be redeemed at par (£100) in three years.

(a) How much would you pay for the bond?
(b) If you paid £105 what yield to maturity would you obtain?

2 A €100 bond with two years to maturity and an annual coupon of 9 per cent is available. (The next coupon is payable in one year.)

(a) If the market requires a yield to maturity of 9 per cent for a bond of this risk class what will be its market price?
(b) If the market price is €98, what yield to maturity does it offer?
(c) If the required yield to maturity on this type of bond changes to 7 per cent, what will the market price change to?

3 (a) If a government sold a 10-year bond with a par value of  $£100$  and an (annual) coupon of 9 per cent, what price can be charged if investors require a 9.5 per cent yield to maturity on such bonds?

(b) If yields to maturity on bonds of this risk class fall to 8.5 per cent, what could the bonds be sold for?
(c) If it were sold for £105, what yield to maturity is the bond offering?
(d) What is the flat yield on this bond if it is selling at £105?

4 The price of a bond issued by C & M plc is 85.50 per cent of par value. The bond will pay an annual 8.5 per cent coupon until maturity (the next coupon will be paid in one year). The bond matures in seven years.

(a) What will be the market price of the bond if yields to maturity for this risk class fall to 7.5 per cent?
(b) What will be the market price of the bond if yields to maturity for this risk class rise to 18 per cent?

5 A zero coupon bond with a par value of 100 matures in five years.

(a) What is the price of the bond if the yield to maturity is 5 per cent?
(b) What is the price of the bond if the yield to maturity is 10 per cent?

6 Bond 1 has an annual coupon rate of 6 per cent and Bond 2 has an annual coupon of 12 per cent. Both bonds mature in one year and have a par value of €100. If the yield to maturity on bonds of this risk class is 10 per cent at what price will the bonds sell? Assume that the next coupons are due in one year's time.

7 You are considering three alternative investments in bonds. The bonds have different times to maturity, but carry the same default risk. You would like to gain an impression of the extent of price volatility for each given alternative change in future interest rates. The investments are:

(i) a two-year bond with an annual coupon of 6 per cent, par value of £100 and the next coupon payment in one year. The present yield to maturity on this bond is 6.5 per cent.
(ii) a ten-year bond with an annual coupon of 6 per cent, a par value of £100 and the next coupon payable in one year. The present yield to maturity on this bond is 7.2 per cent.
(iii) a 20-year bond with an annual coupon of 6 per cent, a par value of £100 and the next coupon due in one year. The present yield to maturity on this bond is 7.7 per cent.

(a) Draw an approximate yield curve.
