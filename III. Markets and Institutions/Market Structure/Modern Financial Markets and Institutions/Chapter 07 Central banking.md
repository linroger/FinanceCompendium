# Central banking

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**

A modern society could not function efficiently without the services provided by a central bank. They not only improve the well-being of the banking sector but, through their oversight of the entire financial system, make life better for all of us. By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

- explain the conduct of monetary policy through the system of reserve requirements combined with open market operations and discount rate changes;
- make clear the ways in which monetary policy impacts various aspects of the nation's economy;
- discuss the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a central bank independent of political influence; describe the rationale and importance of deposit insurance, the lender of last resort function and the measures to control the banks judged too big to fail;
- explain the main regulatory variables that a central bank examines when judging a bank's safety and soundness (using the CAMELS system); explain the issues of bank liquidity and solvency risk, and describe the ways in which the regulators have tried to reduce these, including the Basel Accords;
- outline the central bank's role in the following:

- banker to the national government and management of national debt;
- the issue of currency;
- smooth functioning of payment systems;
- currency reserve control; coordination with international bodies;

describe how the following central banks work: Bank of England, European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve System.

If interest rates are held at a level that is too low then inflation will start to take off. This can be disruptive to businesses in addition to destroying people's savings. It is especially problematic if inflation is high and fluctuating. Then unpredictability makes planning very difficult. However, if interest rates are set at an excessively high level this will inhibit business activity, cause people to put off buying houses and reduce spending in the shops, leading to a recession, with massive job losses. Clearly a society needs an organisation whose task it is to select the appropriate interest rate for the economic conditions it faces: neither too high nor too low. That organisation is the central bank.

Banks are organisations that have high levels of borrowing. That is, the deposits put into them plus the money borrowed from the wholesale financial markets is many times the amount put in by shareholders. Most of the money raised from depositors, wholesale lenders and shareholders is lent out. There are two constant dangers in this. One is that a large proportion of depositors or other lenders insist on withdrawing their cash in the immediate future when the assets that the bank holds (e.g. business loans) cannot be liquidated quickly to satisfy these demands. The second is that the assets of the bank decline while the liabilities remain the same or increase, resulting eventually in insolvency as assets are no longer greater than liabilities. Central banks are usually the regulators that investigate whether banks are being properly managed so that neither liquidity risk nor solvency risk is high.

In addition to the crucial functions of monetary policy (interest rate and money supply) and bank supervision for safety and soundness, central banks help a society in a number of other ways. For example, they usually manage, or at least oversee, the payment systems such as cheque clearing. They also help establish special schemes to guarantee that a depositor will receive at least a minimum sum should the bank become insolvent. This helps create confidence in the banking system. The alternative of regular bank runs in which nervous depositors queue to take their money from a bank before it runs out of cash can lead to human misery and loss of economic output. Another useful service to bolster confidence in the system is that of lender of last resort – if the usual sources of funds for a bank (e.g. depositors, other banks or wholesale money markets) are no longer forthcoming with money, then the central bank will stand ready to supply funds to see the bank over a difficult period. Central banks act as bankers for the government and may assist with management of the government's debt. They may also hold a nation's reserves of gold and foreign currency, and take some part in managing the currency's exchange rate.

Note that this chapter describes the wide variety of responsibilities that a nation may choose to allocate to the purview of the central bank. However, many countries decide to establish alternative organisations to undertake some of the tasks described here while leaving the central bank to concentrate on a few of them.

## Monetary policy

Central banks are given the task of managing the amount of money in an economy and the interest rates in that economy. That is, they conduct monetary policy. Getting monetary policy right is crucial to the well-being of a society. If there is too much money relative to the output of goods and services, with interest rates held too low, then inflation will take off. The resulting uncertainty about future price levels is likely to inhibit economic growth, or, at the very least, penalise those who are not protected against inflation. If monetary policy is too tight, with too little money in the economy and interest rates too high, then production will be lower than it otherwise could be and the greater unemployment will cause misery.

To understand how a central bank controls money supply and interest rates you need to appreciate that it acts as banker to the banks (including other depository institutions, e.g. building societies). As well as accepting deposits from them it has special powers because it can insist that each bank leaves a certain proportion of the amount it has received as deposits from its customers (households, small businesses, etc.) at the central bank. If a bank's reserves at the central bank fall below the minimum required then it has to top this up. Furthermore, banks and other depository institutions like to maintain an additional buffer beyond the required reserves at the central bank.

This extra safety margin of money is called excess reserves. This is an amount that makes the bank feel comfortable about the prospect of a sudden outflow of cash – say dozens of large depositors withdraw billions over a period of a week (there is more on the need for reserves in Chapter 2). The target amount of the excess reserves may, in fact, be largely dictated by the banking regulator (which is usually the central bank) and may be strongly influenced by international agreements on the appropriate amounts, e.g. Basel III – see 'Bank supervision' later in this chapter.

Thus the central bank has a liability – it accepted deposits from banks. Another liability of a central bank is what you see written on notes (or coins) that you have in your wallet or purse: the central bank 'promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of …' or some similarly worded promise. Thus a typical commercial bank will hold some of its assets in the form of reserves either at the central bank or in the form of vault cash in hand. As well as the money held in the banks an economy will have currency in circulation, that is outside of banks. The combination of the two is the monetary base:

<table><tr><td>Monetary base</td><td>=</td><td>currency in circulation</td><td>+</td><td>reserves</td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>=</td><td>required reserves</td><td>+</td><td>vault cash (excess reserves)</td></tr></table>

It is changes in these accounts that determine the size of a nation's money supply (everything else being held constant). If there is an increase either in the currency in circulation or in reserves there will be an increase in the money supply. An increase in reserves, either cash deposited by a bank at the central bank or vault cash, leads to an increase in the level of deposits and thus contributes to the money supply. Central banks conduct monetary policy by changing the country's monetary base.

Typically, a central bank might insist that, say, 10 per cent of the amount deposited by customers be held as the required reserve ratio (reserves as a percentage of deposits). The reserve accounts held by banks at the central bank are used to settle accounts between depository institutions when cheques and electronic payments are cleared. A bank may also hold, say, another 5-10 per cent of the amount deposited by customers as excess reserves. It is important to note that the sole supplier of reserves – notes and coins and balances at the central bank as liabilities of the central bank – is the central bank.

The monetary base described above is often referred to as M0, which is a very extreme form of narrow money, i.e. defining what money is in a very narrow way. Banks can use this base to create broad money, which is a multiple of the monetary base. The definitions of broad money vary from country to country, but generally include money that is held in the form of a current (checking) account or deposit account, and some money market instruments. These broad money aggregates often have names such as M3 or M4. You can see why it is difficult to define money because banks can 'create money'. This is illustrated through Exhibit 7.1.

# Exhibit 7.1 Money creation – the credit multiplier

Assume that all banks in a monetary system are required to keep 20 per cent of deposits as reserves. Bank A has \$100 million of deposits from customers. Because it is sticking to the reserve requirement (required by both the central bank and its own prudential reserves policy) it lends out only \$80 million and keeps 20 million as cash or in its account with the central bank (assume no vault cash for simplicity).

Bank A's opening balance sheet

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>$20m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$100m</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>80m</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

# Exhibit 7.1 Continued

Now if deposits in Bank A are increased by $5 million the position changes. Deposits rise to $105 million and reserves rise to $25 million as the additional $5 million is initially held as reserves at the central bank.

Bank A. An increase in deposits – intermediate period

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>$25m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$105m</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>80m</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

This means that the reserve ratio has risen to $25m ÷ $105m = 23.8 per cent. The bank earns no or little interest from reserves, so it will wish to reduce it back to 20 per cent by lending out the extra. The next balance sheet shows the amount of lending that leaves a 20 per cent reserve ratio, $84m.

Bank A. Lending out just enough to attain minimum reserve ratio

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>$21m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$105m</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>84m</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Now let us bring in more banks. In lending an additional $4 million Bank A will have an impact on the rest of the banking system. If the $4 million is lent to a company and, initially at least, that company deposits the money in Bank B, then at the central bank, Bank A's account will be debited (reserves go down) and Bank B's account will be credited (reserves increase). Bank B will lend out 80 per cent of the amount, or $3.2 million keeping $800,000 in reserves to maintain its 20 per cent ratio of reserves to deposits. The 3.2 million lent finds its way to Bank C, which again holds 20 per cent as reserves and lends the rest, and so on. At each stage 80 per cent of the deposit is lent out, increasing the deposits of other banks, encouraging them to lend.

The effect on the banking system of an injection of $5m of money, under a reserve ratio of $20\%$

<table><tr><td></td><td>Change in deposits, $m</td><td>Change in loans, $m</td><td>Change in reserves, $m</td></tr><tr><td>Bank A</td><td>5.00</td><td>4.00</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Bank B</td><td>4.00</td><td>3.20</td><td>0.80</td></tr><tr><td>Bank C</td><td>3.20</td><td>2.56</td><td>0.64</td></tr><tr><td>Bank D</td><td>2.56</td><td>2.05</td><td>0.51</td></tr><tr><td>Bank E</td><td>2.05</td><td>1.64</td><td>0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Bank F</td><td>….</td><td>….</td><td>….</td></tr><tr><td>Bank G</td><td>….</td><td>….</td><td>….</td></tr><tr><td>Total of all banks</td><td>25</td><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The credit multiplier is a reciprocal of the reserve ratio, which in this case $= 1 \div 0.20 = 5$. Following an injection of \$5 million into the financial system the whole process ends when an additional \$25 million of deposits has been created; equilibrium has been reached again. (The model is a simplification for illustrative purposes. In reality, there might be leakages from the system due to money flowing abroad, or people holding cash or buying government bonds rather than placing it in bank deposits.)

Remember: the creator of the monetary base is the central bank because it has a monopoly on the issuance of currency. If it has control over this then it can strongly influence the broader money supply (including deposits at banks) through the reserves requirements. So, once the system has settled down from the injection of a new deposit, it will be fairly stable – little money creation or removal.

Let us think about where the initial deposit put into Bank A might have come from. If it came from a customer who withdrew it from another bank, the example is null and void because while Bank A benefits from the  \$5 million deposit, the other bank, Bank X, sees a reduction in its reserves at the central bank by an equal amount. It can now lend less than it could before because it has to rebuild its reserves. Thus the stimulus effect of Bank A's deposit is exactly offset by the removal of money from the system by Bank X. If, however, the\$ 5 million came from the central bank purchasing Treasury bills from an investor who then put the newly created cash received into his account with Bank A, we have new money coming into the system and we can expect something like the credit multiplier effect shown above. The central bank is the only player here who can create money out of thin air and pump it into the system if the system is at equilibrium.

Thus, despite commercial banks' ability to create money on the way to equilibrium, there is a limit to the amount that the system as a whole can go up to because for every dollar, pound, euro, etc. created there has to be a fraction held as a cash reserve. It is the central bank that controls the total volume of monetary base (reserves at the central bank plus cash in circulation and at deposit-taking institutions) and so the broader aggregates of money have an upper limit. Small changes in the monetary base can have a large impact on the amount of broad money in the system and so we often refer to the monetary base as high-powered money. It is the monetary base that central banks target to influence money supply, interest rates, inflation and economic output.

Central banks have three major tools they use to increase or decrease the money supply and interest rates: open market operations;

- discount rate changes;
- reserve requirement ratio changes.

# Open market operations

This is the most important tool of monetary policy in most countries today. Open market operations means the buying and selling of government securities (Treasury bills and bonds) in the normal trading markets on a day-to-day basis. In purchasing government securities the central bank creates money to hand it over to those selling. It issues currency notes or it writes a cheque in the name of the owner. When the cheque is drawn on, the central bank just creates an amount of credit for itself to satisfy the buyer – money from thin air. When the central bank sells government securities, the purchasers draw on their money in the banking system which leads to a lowering of reserves.

To illustrate the creation of money by a central bank we can take Bank A's balance sheet from Exhibit 7.1. The starting position is:

Bank A. Lending out just enough to attain minimum reserve ratio

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>$21m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$105m</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>84m</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The central bank wants to inject money into the financial system and lower interest rates. It offers to buy billions of dollars of government securities. One of the customers of Bank A sells \$6 million of securities to the central bank. The central bank sends money to the customer of Bank A who deposits the newly created money (an electronic record rather than cash) in Bank A. Bank A adds this \$6 million to its reserve account at the central bank. Now Bank A's balance sheet looks like this.

Bank A balance sheet after an injection of 6m

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>$27m</td><td>Deposits</td><td>$111m</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>84m</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Bank A has a very high reserve level relative to its deposits, $\27\mathrm{m} \div \$111\mathrm{m} = 24.3$ per cent. The managers will want to employ the surplus money above that needed to maintain the target reserve ratio (20 per cent) to earn higher interest by lending it, thus new money flows into the financial system. If the central bank wanted to drain money from the system through open market operations it would sell government securities to investors, which reduces the amount held by banks in their reserve accounts at the central bank or reduces vault cash. This would curb lending and raise interest rates.

Central banks tend to use Treasury securities to conduct open market operations because the secondary market in these securities is very liquid and a large volume of these securities held by dealers and investors, meaning that the market can absorb a large number of buy and sell transactions. The main method used is a repurchase agreement – a repo – in which the central bank purchases securities with a prior agreement to sell them back to the counterparty after, say, 24 hours, 7 days or 14 days. The difference between the buying and selling price provides the effective interest rate. If the central bank wanted to drain money it would engage in a reverse repo (there is more on repos in Chapter 5).

Repos and reverse repos are, by their nature, temporary interventions because the opposite transaction takes place on maturity, a few days after the first buy or sell. There are times when the central bank wants to effect a more permanent change in the money supply. Then it can go for an outright transaction, a purchase or a sale, that is not destined to be reversed in a few days.

What you need to bear in mind is that every day banks trade surplus reserves with each other. Banks always have an incentive to lend – even if only for 24 hours – if they find themselves with too many reserves. Each day there will be dozens of other banks that find themselves temporarily below the reserve level they need and so they willingly borrow in the interbank market.

# The supply and demand of reserves

The main target for central banks is usually the overnight (24-hour) interest rate on loans of reserves from one bank to another. In the US this is the federal funds rate in the Eurozone it is the overnight repo rate in euros, and in the UK it is the overnight sterling repo rate. Switzerland opts for the Swiss franc LIBOR target rate.

The demand curve for reserves falls as interest rates rise. That is, the quantity of reserves demanded by banks (holding all else constant) reduces if banks have a higher opportunity cost of keeping money in the form of reserves. They would rather lend it out to achieve higher interest rates. This becomes more and more of a lost opportunity as rates in the short-term interest rate markets rise. Bankers increasingly start to think that they can economise on the vault cash buffer if interest rates are high and so lend these out more at the overnight repo rate, say. Thus, the demand curve for reserves, D, slopes downwards in Exhibit 7.2.

The central bank usually has a continuous programme of lending and so there is a large quantity of money borrowed by the banks from the central bank at any one time. It is through the adjustment to the amount of lent reserves outstanding that the central bank controls interest rates. The supply curve for reserves, S, shown in blue, is the amount of reserves borrowed from the central bank supplied through its open market operations - fixed at that point in time. Equilibrium occurs where the demand for reserves equals the quantity supplied. This occurs at an interest rate of A, providing the short-term interest rate in the market.

Now imagine that the central bank wishes to increase the supply of money and lower interest rates. It does this by increasing its purchases of government securities, providing a greater quantity of reserves. This pushes the supply curve in Exhibit 7.3 from S1 to S2 and moves the equilibrium interest rate from A to B. Obviously, if the central bank reduced its reserves outstanding to the banking system by selling additional securities, the supply curve would move to the left and interest rates would rise.

Exhibit 7.3 An open market increase in the supply of reserves

So far we have discussed dynamic open market operations, that is, where the central bank takes the initiative to change the level of reserves and the monetary base within a reasonably static banking environment. However, many times the environment is not static because there are a number of factors changing demand for borrowed reserves e.g. greater or lesser banker confidence in the economy and thus the potential for low-risk lending. Thus, it intervenes - a defensive open market operation - to offset the other factors influencing reserves.

When the central bank wants to change short-term interest rates it can often do so merely by announcing its new target rate and threatening to undertake open market operations to achieve it rather than actually intervening. The money market participants know that if they do not immediately move to the new rate they will find difficulties. For example, if the central bank shifts to target an interest rate lower than previously (i.e. it will lend on the repo market at a new lower rate) then anyone wanting to borrow will be foolish to borrow at a higher rate. Conversely, if the central bank announces a new higher target rate, anyone wanting to lend will be foolish to accept a lower rate than the central bank's target, because it stands ready to trade at its stated rate.

# Discount rate changes

There is an option for banks to borrow additional reserves from the central bank – this is discount window borrowing. So, if Bank A is temporarily short of reserves it could ask the central bank to simply create additional reserves and add them to its account at the central bank. There is thus an increase in reserves in the financial system and an increase in the money supply. Furthermore, Bank A could borrow from the central bank's discount window even if it was not short of reserves. It could then lend the money to businesses and individuals or lend the additional reserves to other banks in the money markets (e.g. repo).

Discount loans have to be repaid. When they are, the total amount of reserves, the monetary base and the money supply will fall.

So, why are banks not continually borrowing from the discount window? Well, there's a catch. The central bank tends to charge an interest rate on discount window borrowing that is significantly higher (usually around 100 basis points) than banks can borrow in the money markets. If this interest premium falls then an increasing number of banks will borrow at the discount rate. If the premium rises then few banks will borrow this way. Thus banks rein in their lending to customers for fear of having to borrow themselves at punitive interest rates. The discount rate acts as a back-stop for the open market target interest rate. The money market rate will not rise above the discount rate, so long as the central bank remains willing to supply unlimited funds at the discount rate.

If we introduce the possibility of large volumes of supply of money (reserves) from the central bank at a high interest rate then we have the upside-down L-shaped supply curve shown in Exhibit 7.4. If the demand curve D1 is the relevant demand schedule then the horizontal portion of the curve – banks borrowing from the central bank at the discount rate – does not come into play. Banks will continue to borrow and lend in the money markets but not from the central bank, and the equilibrium interest rate remains at A. This is the case most of the time: changes in the discount rate have no direct effect on the market interest rate.

Exhibit 7.4 Discount rate lending availability changes the supply curve

Now consider the case where there has been a shock to the system and banks increase their demand for reserves all the way along the curve – the demand curve has shifted to the right, from D1 to D2. Indeed, it has shifted so much that banks now borrow from the central bank at the discount rate to top up their reserves – see demand curve D2 intersecting the supply curve at the discount rate at point M in Exhibit 7.5. Now, if the central bank moves the discount rate up or

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/ca1cd206d2f776334891689dedae9fbc555cdb35b869ceff3a9c6b7807465282.jpg)

Exhibit 7.5 Discount window lending down, the point of intersection with the demand curve shifts and thus the market interest rates change. If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it could move the discount rate from, say, F to G, leading to increased borrowing from the central bank and an increased money supply.

A few decades ago adjusting the discount rate was the main way in which many central banks effected monetary policy, but the problem with this approach became increasingly apparent. It is difficult to predict the quantity of discount rate borrowing that will occur if the discount rate is raised or lowered, and so it is difficult to accurately change the money supply. Today changes in the discount rate are used to signal to the market that the central bank would like to see higher or lower interest rates: a raising indicates that tighter monetary conditions are required with higher interest rates throughout; lowering it indicates that looser, more expansionary monetary conditions are seen as necessary. Discount rate borrowing is used by generally sound banks in normal market conditions on a short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate above the normal open market target rate. But, given the higher interest rate, it is used sparingly. Companies in real trouble, unable to borrow in the money markets and experiencing severe liquidity problems, may have to pay an even higher interest rate than the discount rate to borrow from the central bank.

# Reserve requirement ratio changes

The power to change the reserve requirement ratio is a further tool used by central banks to control a nation's money supply. A decrease in the reserve requirement ratio means that banks do not need to hold as much money at the central bank or in vault cash and so they are able to lend out a greater percentage of their deposits, thus increasing the supply of money. The new loans result in consumption or investment in the economy, which raises inflows into other banks in the financial system and the credit multiplier effect takes hold, as illustrated in Exhibit 7.1. The process of borrowing and depositing in the banking system continues until deposits have grown sufficiently such that the new reserve amounts permit just the right amount of deposits – the target reserve ratio is reached.

Exhibit 7.6 shows that when the required reserve ratio is raised, the quantity of reserves demanded by banks increases for any given interest rate – the demand curve shifts from D1 to D2. This results in a new equilibrium being formed at the higher interest rate of C.

Conversely, a decrease in the required ratio leads to a decrease in the quantity of reserves demanded by banks, allowing more to be lent out, e.g. via repos, resulting in falling interest rates.

The main drawback to using changes in the reserve ratio is that it is difficult to make many frequent small adjustments because to do so would be disruptive to the banking system (a sudden rise can cause liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves). Open market operations, however, can be used every day to cope with fluctuations in monetary conditions.

By Justine Lau in Hong Kong and Geoff Dyer in Beijing

Beijing and Hong Kong have unveiled a raft of measures to curb rising prices as both governments struggle to curb inflationary pressures and real estate speculation in their fast-growing economies.

The Chinese central bank on Friday raised capital reserve requirements for its banks for the fifth time this year in order to "appropriately control" credit and liquidity.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government significantly raised the stamp duty on residential prop erty transactions to damp property speculation.

The People's Bank of China said the proportion of deposits to be set aside by banks should increase by 50 basis points to 18.5 per cent for large banks, the highest level ever.

In an effort to tackle spiralling property prices in Hong Kong - partly because of an influx of money from mainland China - the government raised the stamp duty on properties resold within six months to a hefty 15 per cent.

Separately, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto central bank, announced an increase in the down payment for properties worth more than HK$12m (US$1.5m) to 50 per cent, up from 40 per cent. It also increased the deposit requirement on any properties not occupied by owners or held by a company to 50 per cent.

# Averaging reserves

The leading central banks usually do not require that reserves are a fixed percentage of deposits every day. Instead they insist on the average reserve ratio over a month being above a particular level. Thus, banks are permitted to go below the designated ratio for a number of days in the month, but will have to make up for this on other days. This allows a bank more flexibility because there are bound to be days when there is a large outflow (e.g. when millions of people pay their tax bills), which can be followed by a gradual rebuilding of reserves by borrowing from other financial institutions (or the central bank) over the following week or so.

# How monetary policy impacts the economy

The actions of the central bank are designed to have a significant impact on the key economic variables. These relationships are shown in Exhibit 7.8. If the central bank believes that the economy needs to expand at a faster rate (while not unleashing high inflation), it can follow the pink route (selecting the most appropriate monetary tool). Lower interest rates encourage consumers to borrow and businesses to invest. If, however, it looks as though it is already expanding too fast to achieve the required inflation rate, the central bank can rein it in by following the purple route in which interest rates rise, money supply falls and people and businesses spend less.

Exhibit 7.8 The flow-through from monetary policy to the economy

We have not yet discussed the impact of interest rate changes on the exchange rate. This is a complicated area, but generally the rule is: if interest rates are falling relative to those in foreign countries, the currency drops relative to those other currencies because international investors, looking for high returns, place their money elsewhere by selling the assets in the currency with the low interest rate and buying another currency to invest in that country. However, this superficially neat relationship is complicated by numerous other factors, not least anticipated inflation rates – there is more on exchange rate determination in Chapter 12. A fall in relative value of a currency is likely to make it easier for exporters to sell abroad as their products become relatively cheaper compared with foreign goods.

Some central banks have a specific goal for inflation. For example, the European Central Bank has a stated aim of a rate below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term, whereas the Bank of England is required to achieve 2 per cent, but anything within the 1-3 per cent range is regarded as acceptable in the short run, so long as there is a plan to move to nearer 2 per cent. Those central banks that have a specific target as well as those that do not, other than 'low and stable inflation', also take into account the impact of their actions on the other major macroeconomic variables. There are a number of other elements they consider:

- High employment and steady economic growth Not only does unemployment often cause pain to those families affected by it, but the economy wastes resources in idleness, lowering long-term well-being. Having said that, it makes sense to allow some unemployment as people are happily searching for the right position for them. So, while they are searching they are classified as unemployed. Many people who have taken time out to attend college, raise a family or go travelling may re-enter the jobs market but not find an appropriate job quickly and so they are classified as unemployed. Matching people to suitable posts does not happen instantaneously, thus there will always be some amount of frictional unemployment.

Another type is structural unemployment. This is where the skills people have do not match what the market needs or the location of people does not match the needs of employers. For example, in the 1980s millions of coal miners were made redundant and found it difficult to obtain new positions when their skill-set and the location of their family homes were not suited to the newer industries.

If the central bank tries to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates to such an extent that frictional and structural unemployment is reduced below its natural rate, inflation is likely to rise as output fails to keep up with the new quantities of money flooding the economy. Thus, we tolerate, even welcome, some unemployment. The best that policy makers can hope for is that the economy reaches its natural rate of unemployment, i.e. a level of non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). To achieve long-run reductions in unemployment below the current NAIRU policy makers need to work on the supply-side efficiency of the economy, e.g. raise skill levels, create a more pro-business, pro-innovation environment and culture, lower labour market rigidities inhibiting corporations from hiring and people from moving, lower taxes to encourage investment by firms. The difficulty for our economic leaders is estimating the level of NAIRU. Is it at 4 per cent unemployment or 6 per cent? If a better job-finding service were launched, would NAIRU decline significantly? It is these issues that economists, central bankers and politicians debate.

- Interest rate stability People and businesses are harmed by volatility in interest rates because of the additional uncertainty it introduces to their decision making, resulting in forward-planning problems. Thus house purchase decisions, factory investment decisions or bond market purchase decisions are made more hesitantly in a fluctuating interest rate economy, leading to lower economic output.
- Stability of the financial system We discussed the main roles of the financial system players in Chapter 1, particularly the channelling of savings into productive use. These mechanisms can be disrupted if financial crises are permitted to occur. Just ask the Icelanders, Greeks and the Irish if they value the stability of the financial system. Instability can cause economic output drops, high unemployment, asset price crashes (e.g. houses) and austerity measures cutting wages and pensions. While monetary policy is one tool to promote stability, there are many more measures that the central bank (or other designated regulators) can take. These are discussed later in the chapter.
- Stability in the foreign exchange markets The economies of the nation states are increasingly integrated into the world economy with ever larger volumes of imports, exports and overseas investment. The value of a currency relative to others can have profound effects on the producers in that economy. For example, a rise in the currency may make exporting more difficult. Also, fluctuations in the currency make planning difficult. Thus central banks are cognisant of the impact of interest rate changes on the level and stability of the exchange rate.

Over a run of years the goal of price stability does not conflict with the other goals. For example, higher inflation does not produce lower unemployment so there is no long-term trade-off between these two goals. There might be a trade-off in the short run. So, lowering interest rates may encourage consumer spending, house purchase and corporate investment, and the taking on of more workers. But once the economy has reached its productive capacity limit, additional demand from the lower rates is likely to push up wages and prices, rather than output. The alarmed authorities then need to take firm action (e.g. much higher interest rates) to squeeze demand out of the economy, causing painfully higher levels of unemployment. All in all, it is better if price stability at a low inflation rate is pursued from year to year, rather than having to make corrections after explosions or slumps in demand. Stability promotes economic growth.

Having said this, it is important to avoid focusing excessively on inflation in the short term and thereby forcing economic growth to fluctuate too much. For example, for a number of months in 2010 and 2011 UK inflation was above the 3 per cent limit. Mervyn King, the Governor of the BoE, explained that it would be wrong to raise interest rates to counteract this, because he believed that the high inflation rate was merely temporary and to raise rates while the UK economy was in recession could be very damaging. He thus temporarily prioritised growth over immediate inflation, while keeping a watchful stance on anticipated inflation a year or so down the line.

Many financial systems have a hierarchy of objectives whereby price stability is set as the primary objective. Then, so long as that is achieved, the other objectives can be aimed at. The US is going through a debate about its goals at the time of writing. The Federal Reserve is supposed to balance out high growth, maximum employment and stable prices, but policy makers are considering a switch to a hierarchy with inflation prioritised – see Exhibit 7.9.

# Exhibit 7.9

# Bernanke moves closer to formal inflation target

FT

# Robin Harding

Ben Bernanke's road to an explicit inflation objective for the Federal Reserve has been a long one and he has still not reached the end of it.

Yesterday, however, the Fed chairman took another big step towards setting a numerical target for the US central bank by putting his interpretation of the Fed's inflation mandate into a speech. "FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] participants generally judge the mandate-consistent inflation rate to be about 2 per cent or a bit below," Mr Bernanke said.

That does not sound dramatic but it is of vital importance because the Fed is moving towards another round of quantitative easing - the policy of expanding its balance sheet by buying assets to push down long-term interest rates – in order to deal with a sluggish economic recovery that has left US unemployment stuck at 9.6 per cent.

Focusing on a 2 per cent inflation goal tells the world how the Fed will justify another round of quantitative easing and how it will control its size. Mr Bernanke's speech implies that the Fed will buy assets until it is on track to hit its inflation goal.

The number is important for another reason as well: it should help to persuade the public that inflation will return to 2 per cent in the future. That should encourage people to borrow at current low interest rates and deter any expectations that could be self-fulfilling, of a spiral into deflation.

Mr Bernanke has been pressing for a clear inflation goal since he became Fed chairman in 2006. At his confirmation hearings in 2005, Mr Bernanke extolled the benefits of inflation targets. Most central banks around the world, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, have some kind of numerical inflation goal.

# The independence of central banks

An important question for a government to decide is the degree of freedom it gives its central bank to conduct monetary policy. Is it to be conducted by the central bank's own experts or should elected politicians have the ultimate say on whether interest rates should rise or fall?

There are two types of independence:

- Instrument independence The central bank can decide when and how to use monetary policy instruments without political interference.
- Goal independence The central bank decides the goals of monetary policy.

Instrument independence is common, but goal independence is rare. The US central bank, the Fed, has both types of independence – politicians do not control the Board of Governors nor the purse strings of the Fed (although they can influence the appointment of some board members). The European Central Bank has an extraordinary degree of independence. The member country governments of the Eurosystem are not permitted to instruct the ECB. The Maastricht Treaty, which established the monetary union, states that the long-term goal of the ECB is price stability, but does not specify what that means, leaving it up to the Executive Board members to decide the target inflation rate. And, of course, the ECB has control over the tools it uses. Furthermore, whereas the US system can be changed by new legislation (if the politicians change the law they can establish control over the Fed), this is more difficult in the Eurozone, because the Eurosystem's charter can be altered only by a revision of the Maastricht Treaty, which requires consent of all the signatory countries. In 1997, the Bank of England was given a high degree of instrument independence to decide when and how to raise or lower interest rates (prior to that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had ultimate control). However, the government can in extreme economic circumstances overrule the Bank for a limited period. The inflation goal is still established by the Chancellor.

# The advantages of independence
- Political control can lead to higher inflation It is argued that politicians often have a short-term perspective driven by the need to impress voters before the next election. This may mean sacrificing a stable price level to achieve immediate improvements in unemployment, growth or house mortgage rates. The populace, also often short-sighted, sees the immediate improvement, but does not grasp the long-term damage wrought when inflation takes off in the low interest rate environment. It is only a year or so later that they suffer the effects of economic instability and the need to bring down inflation. A politically insulated central bank is more likely to take decisions which are beneficial over the long run, even if they cause a little pain now. Thus, instead of politically motivated booms just before elections and busts after them, we see a more stable pattern of growth and inflation.
- Reduced temptation to support government spending The central bank regularly buys and sells bonds and Treasury bills previously issued by the government to influence the interest rates banks are charging each other when borrowing to top up their reserves. It is another step to start buying government instruments direct when the government wishes to expand its spending. In buying them the central bank will create new money which the government will put into the economy when it buys new bridges, for instance, or pays out more in social security. This can be dangerously inflationary. It is what Zimbabwe did in the 2000s – resulting in inflation of millions of percent per year.
- Politicians lack expertise Central bank employees have much more skill in this area than the average politician, or even the above-average politician.

# The disadvantages of independence
- **Undemocratic** The central bank makes important decisions that affect everyone and yet it is in the control of people who are not accountable at the ballot box. Politicians control fiscal policy (government spending and taxation); perhaps they should also control monetary policy so that the two can be better coordinated. But would such consolidating of the levers of economic power really bring about a better result?
- Central banks fail from time to time In the early 1930s central banks failed to put money into the financial system at crucial moments. They also failed to analyse and act upon the build-up to the 2008 crisis, in particular the excessive borrowing and rise in asset (e.g. house) prices. Are these failures of independence? Were there wiser political voices outside the central bank anticipating problems and calling for robust countervailing action? I can't speak of the 1930s politicians, but my memory of 2006 and 2007 is not peppered with smart politicians' warnings of doom.

Some academic research has investigated the correlation between independence and inflation performance and concluded that more independence leads to lower inflation without lower real economic performance (unemployment or output).

Political independence is so highly prized by Eurozone policy makers that there was a storm in 2010 when the ECB was persuaded to purchase European government bonds to help the financial rescue of Greece in May and to try to avoid one in Portugal and Spain in December. Even though this did not put more money into the financial system because the ECB sold other securities to offset the potential monetary boost, it was seen as bestowing a favour on a few countries by propping up their bond markets – see Exhibit 7.10.

# Bank's U-turn stokes concern over political interference

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/74e20456eed64573a461cbb26e72b564ef069f09d53ea44a63b00071ea692da8.jpg)

By Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt

The European Central Bank rode to the eurozone's rescue yesterday after executing one of the sharpest policy U-turns in its 12 year history, but in the process raising concerns about its politicisation in the wake of Europe's financial crises.

Purchases of eurozone government bonds on an undisclosed scale - a step regarded as unthinkable until recently - began just hours after the ECB's 3.15am announcement of a package of measures to shore-up the eurozone's stability.

The controversial step provoked rare public dissent within the ECB's decision-making government council. Axel Weber, Germany's Bundesbank president and known ECB "hawk", criticised the move "even in this exceptional situation", in an interview due to be published today in a German newspaper.

The ECB also said it was stepping up the provision of emergency liquidity to banks by reintroducing unlimited offers of three and six month funds, and teaming up with the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to provide extra dollar liquidity.

The action threw into reverse the ECB's "exit strategy", by which it had been undoing gradually the exceptional measures it had taken since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

As such, they were a clear show of force by the eurozone's monetary guardian. But the package was controversial because it took the ECB significantly closer, if not beyond, the boundary separating fiscal and monetary policy in Europe's monetary union - creating risks to the central bank's independence.

"The more you are part of the game, the harder it is to be independent," said Jörg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

Speaking in Basel, Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, said that despite Mr Weber's objections, the ECB's governing council had approved the bond purchases by an "overwhelming majority" and he denied the ECB had succumbed to political interference.

The ECB had delayed its decisions until after European Union finance ministers had reached agreement, in the early hours of yesterday, on separate emergency funding facilities. The co-ordinated approach almost certainly boosted the impact of yesterday's moves. But the delay could have added to last week's financial market volatility.

By intervening in the public and private debt markets, the ECB has now moved closer to the large-scale outright asset purchase schemes launched by the US Fed and UK Bank of England. But there are also big differences. The ECB's "securities markets programme" is aimed at easing tensions in financial markets and is not a "quantitative easing" programme to boost economic growth or inflation.

The ECB's refusal to give details on the programme's scale were part of efforts to stress its techni cal nature, and yesterday's market reaction suggested it could have a big impact even with modest purchases. Asset purchases will also be "neutralised" with the liquidity injected into financial system reabsorbed elsewhere by the ECB,

perhaps into fixed-term deposits, to reduce inflation risks.

That strictly monetary focus of the programme could have helped Mr Trichet persuade other "hawks" on the governing council to agree to the plan. However, they might also have been persuaded by the sheer scale of the crisis in the eurozone, such as the surge in the financial market nervousness on Friday.

# Quantitative easing

In extreme circumstances a central bank may find that interest rates have been reduced to the lowest level they could go and yet still economic activity does not pick up. People are so shocked by the crisis – increased chance of unemployment, lower house prices, lower business profits – that they cut their consumption and investment regardless of being able to borrow at very low interest rates. This happened in 2009 and 2010. Annualised short-term interest rates in Eurozone countries were less than 1 per cent, in the UK they were 0.5 per cent and in the US they were between 0 per cent and 0.25 per cent. Clearly, low short-term interest rates were not enough to get the economy moving, even with the additional boost of government deficit spending to the extent that up to one-eighth of all spending was from government borrowing.

In response another policy tool was devised: quantitative easing. This involves the central bank electronically creating money ('printing money') which is then used to buy assets from investors in the market. Thus pension funds, insurance companies, non-financial firms, etc. can sell assets, mostly long-term government bonds (but can include mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds), and their bank accounts are credited with newly created money. This raises bank reserves, allowing more lending in the economy. Furthermore, the increased demand for government bonds raises their prices and lowers interest rates along the yield curve. In the UK the BoE bought £200 billion of such assets during 2009 and 2010. The Fed bought \$1,750 billion bonds (mostly mortgage-backed and government), then ran a second round (called QE2) in 2010-2011 of \$600 billion. There is much discussion about the effectiveness and dangers of quantitative easing – see Exhibit 7.11.

# The Fed is right to turn on the tap

# Martin Wolf

The sky is falling, scream the hysterics: the Federal Reserve is pouring forth dollars in such quantities that they will soon be worthless. Nothing could be further from the truth. As in Japan, the policy known as "quantitative easing" is far more likely to prove ineffective than lethal. It is a leaky hose, not a monetary Noah's Flood.

So what is the Fed doing? Why is it doing it? Why are the criticisms ludicrous? What should the Fed be doing, instead?

The answer to the first is clear. As the Fed stated on November 3, "to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the [federal open market] committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities. The committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principle payments from its securities holdings. In addition, the committee intends to purchase a further 600bn of longer-term

Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about 75bn per month."

Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, gave the rationale in a speech last month. He pointed out that US unemployment is far above any reasonable estimate of equilibrium. Moreover, prospective economic growth makes it unlikely that this will change over the course of 2011. This is bad enough, but what makes it worse is that underlying inflation has fallen close to

# Exhibit 7.11 continued

1 per cent, in spite of the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet, over which so many tears were shed. Expectations of inflation were well anchored, he added, but that might change once deflation gripped. Given the slack, that might not be far away.

The Fed, added the chairman, has a dual mandate, to foster maximum unemployment and price stability. Doing nothing would be incompatible with this obligation. The only question is what is to be done. The answer is the proposed purchases of Treasury bonds. This simply extends classic open market operations up the yield curve. It would also only expand the Fed's balance sheet by about a quarter, or around 4 per cent of gross domestic product. Is the US really on the same road as the Weimar Republic? In a word, no.

It is hardly a surprise that Wolfgang Schäuble, finance minister of Germany, thinks differently. He describes the US growth model as in "deep crisis", adding that "it's not right when the Americans accuse China of manipulating exchange rates and then push the dollar exchange rate lower by opening up the flood gates". Presumably, he believes that, in a proper world, the US would be forced to allow the deflationary route imposed upon Greece and Ireland instead. This is not going to happen. Nor should it.

Boiled down, the criticisms of the Fed come down to two: its policies are leading to hyperinflation; and they are "beggar my neighbour", in consequence, if not intention.

The first of these criticisms is not just wrong, but weird. The essence of the contemporary mon etary system is creation of money, out of nothing, by private banks' often foolish lending. Why is such privatisation of a public function right and proper, but action by the central bank, to meet pressing public need, a road to catastrophe? When banks will not lend and the broad money supply is barely growing, that is just what it should be doing.

The hysterics then add that it is impossible to shrink the Fed's balance sheet fast enough to prevent excessive monetary expansion. That is also nonsense. If the economy took off, nothing would be easier. Indeed, the Fed explained precisely what it would do in its monetary report to Congress last July. If the worst came to the worst, it could just raise reserve requirements.

Now turn to the argument that the Fed is deliberately weakening the dollar. Any moderately aware person knows that the Fed's mandate does not include the external value of the dollar. Those governments that have piled up an extra  \$6,800bn in foreign reserves since January 2000, much of it in dollars, are consenting adults. Not only did no one ask China, the foremost example, to add the huge sum of\$ 2,400bn to its reserves, but many strongly asked it not to do so.

It is also simply false to argue that the weakening dollar is due to Fed policies alone. Indeed, anyone with half a brain should realise that the US can no longer combine a large trade deficit with a manageable fiscal position. Those who want their US bonds to stay sound should welcome anything that helps the US expand domestic demand and rebalance its external position. Current US monetary policies are, contrary to Mr Schäuble's views, simply the yang to the yin of east Asian mercantilism.

More fundamentally, market forces, not monetary policy, are pushing global rebalancing, as the private sector tries to put its money where it sees the opportunities. The Fed's monetary policies merely add a twist. Instead of all the futile bleating, what was needed was a co-ordinated appreciation of the currencies of the emerging economies. The fault here does not lie with the US. I sympathise strongly with a Brazil or a South Africa, but not with China.

The sky is not falling. But this does not mean the Fed's policies are the best possible. It is probable that any impact on the yields on medium-term bonds will have a modest economic effect. It would be far better if the Fed could shift inflation expectations upwards, by issuing a commitment to offset a prolonged period of below-target inflation with one of above-target inflation. A decision to monetise additional government spending might be an even more effective tool. Equally necessary is a plan to accelerate the restructuring of the overhang of excessive debt. But, in the absence of co-operation with the newly elected Congress, what the Fed is doing is, alas, about the most we can do now expect, though it should have dared to do more. Meanwhile "sound" people will shriek that the sky is falling only to be surprised that it is not. We have seen this play before - in Japan in the 1990s. Japan fell into chronic deflation, instead.

# Safety and soundness of the financial system

The collapse of many banks into insolvency in 2008 is a reminder of the vulnerability of these institutions. The mere fear of a bank collapse can lead to recession/depression as a damaging wave of lowered confidence in financial institutions sweeps through economies. A hundred years ago banks would fail on a regular basis, but today we have a number of mechanisms to reassure people and businesses that their money is safe within the banking system. Some of these mechanisms were found wanting in the recent financial crisis and so policy makers are currently looking for fixes for these. Nevertheless, the modern system is generally far safer than it was 100 years ago.

# Depositor insurance

Bank runs occur when depositors fear that because a bank holds in cash or near-cash only a fraction of the total deposits, if, say, 20 per cent of depositors want to take their money in cash the bank would not be able to pay and could be declared bust. Most of the time people are sanguine about this problem because they know that on a typical day the amount of net withdrawals (i.e. money taken from the bank minus money put into accounts at that bank) is a minuscule proportion of total deposits. This all relies on psychology: people have to have a great deal of confidence that the bank will be able to pay out when they want their money back. The trouble arises when something disturbs that confidence. In the film It's a Wonderful Life George (James Stewart) loses 8,000 of the bank's money. News that the bank might be in trouble leaks out and people queue up to demand their cash. The bank cannot pay everyone immediately despite there being plenty of value in the bank in the form of house mortgages. The story was repeated in 2007 in the UK (without Clarence, the Angel!) when news spread that Northern Rock, a building society turned bank, might be unable to repay depositors. Panicked depositors queued around the block in towns and cities up and down the country to take out their money.

Losing one bank to a run, caused either by rational or irrational fear and rumour, is bad enough, but the problem stretches further than that because the bank subject to a run is likely to have lent other banks money or have other interbank transactions outstanding, e.g. it might be due to pay large sums on a number of derivatives deals. Once it feels under pressure from its depositors it might withdraw money it holds with other banks to raise some cash, causing one or two of them to have liquidity problems. They might then collapse, leading to yet more banks (which have lent to these banks or hold deposits from these banks) coming under pressure. And so a domino effect might flow through the banking system.

One way to reduce the risk of bank runs (and to make the system fairer for the innocent depositors) is for the government or some regulatory body to step in and say they will guarantee that depositors will be repaid even if the bank cannot do so. In the case of Northern Rock the UK government had to step in and guarantee all deposits without a limit on how much it would pay out to any one depositor. This was an extreme situation; normally a limit is set. Thus, in the European scheme the limit is €100,000 per depositor. It is thought that people with large deposits are sophisticated enough to look after themselves, to be able to assess the bank's true financial status, and so should avoid high-risk banks, or at least demand a premium return for the additional risk. This policy does have a drawback though. In the autumn of 2010 corporations transferred billions of euros from their deposits in Irish banks because they were afraid the whole system was about to collapse and they saw the €100,000 of insurance as peanuts in comparison with their deposits. To some extent this fear became self-fulfilling as Irish banks lost cash and could not replace it other than through borrowing more from the ECB (see lender of last resort function below). Eventually the Irish financial system had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund, European countries and the ECB.

In the US, the insurer of deposits is not the Fed but the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which pays out up to  \$250,000 per depositor. In the UK, until the Northern Rock crisis the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (outside of BoE) paid\$ 30,000 in full and 90 per cent of the next £20,000. Because many depositors held more than £30,000 they knew that they were not fully covered and so rushed to withdraw their money from Northern Rock. Today the Scheme pays out full compensation up to the maximum of £85,000, which covers the vast majority of depositors.

# Lender of last resort

Another safety net for banks and their depositors is the lender of last resort function of the central bank: to prevent a bank failure leading on to other bank failures the central bank will step in to provide reserves when no one else will lend to the banks. Following the September 11 2001 World Trade Center attack many cheques were stuck on grounded aircraft and so a number of banks missed an inflow of money for a few days, thus their reserves declined. Furthermore, bank customers increased their demand for cash. The Federal Reserve kept the banking system going by adding  \$38 billion through repurchase agreements to the banks that needed money to restore their reserve levels. It also increased its discount window lending by 200-fold to\$ 45 billion. The terrorists did not bring down the financial system.

In 2008, the sub-prime crisis produced fear among the banks. They did not know the extent of another bank's exposure to the sub-prime mortgage instrument risk. In response they held onto cash and refused to lend it to other banks. The ECB and the Fed therefore provided very large volumes of short-term funds to the banks so that they could maintain reserve levels and not run out of cash.

Note that the lender of last resort function is not there all the time – it is for when the central bank governors judge there to be an emergency. Also, not every bank will be bailed out – many will be left to fail depending on the route they took to get to a poor liquidity or solvency position (was it fecklessness or bad luck, for example) or whether the bank's failure will cause systemic collapse of the banking industry.

It is necessary to have both the lender of last resort role and deposit insurance schemes because insurance tends to cover only about 1 per cent of the outstanding deposits – there are many financial deals, usually between banks, which dwarf retail deposits. These financial and corporate institutions need reassurance that the central bank will not permit a failure due to a bank running short of reserves – a liquidity crisis.

In the recent financial crisis central banks found many ways to lend to the banks. In the UK, for example, the BoE introduced the Special Liquidity Scheme in 2008 which allowed banks to exchange, for up to three years, bonds backed by mortgage payments (securitised bonds) for UK Treasury bills. These could then be sold when the bank needed extra reserves. The BoE also relaxed the rules on the type of securities that can be used as collateral in repos, i.e. beyond government securities. The Fed bought 1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities in 2009 to keep the mortgage market going – no one else would buy. It also allowed banks to draw down overnight loans from the Fed using some pretty risky securities as collateral (the Fed normally insists on US government bills and bonds as collateral) – see Exhibit 7.12.

# Crisis-hit banks flooded Fed with junk

By Francesco Guerrera in New York and Robin Harding in Washington

Banks flooded the Federal Reserve with billions of dollars in "junk bonds" and other low-grade collateral in exchange for much-needed liquidity during the crisis, as the financial sector struggled under a crippling credit crunch, new data show.

More than 36 per cent of the cumulative collateral pledged to the US central bank in return for overnight funding under Primary Dealer Credit Facility was equities or bonds ranked below investment grade. A further 17 per cent was unrated credit or loans, according to a Financial Times analysis of Fed data released this week.

Only 1 per cent of the collateral was Treasury bonds which are normally used in transactions between banks and the monetary authorities.

The Fed created the PDCF in March 2008 after the demise of Bear Stearns to ease investment banks' liquidity problems. At the time, it allowed banks to pledge only investment grade-rated collateral.

But after the failure of talks to save Lehman paved the way for its bankruptcy, the Fed broadened the collateral requirements to include any asset that can be used in the tri-party repo system.

Investment banks responded by using their inventory of equities and other low-grade securities to borrow from the Fed. The Fed protected itself by imposing larger "haircuts" on riskier securities and emphasises that all of its emergency lending was paid back in full with interest.

Within a day of easing the collateral requirements, Credit Suisse had borrowed 1bn from the PDCF, using it for the first of only two times, against a collateral portfolio that was made up of 91 per cent equity.

Credit Suisse declined to comment but people familiar with the situation said the two deals were tests to check whether the system was working.

By the following Monday, 41 per cent off all collateral pledged against PDCF borrowing by several banks was equity, and another 11 per cent was subinvestment grade bonds. At its peak – on September 29 2008 – the Fed had exposure to 86bn of equity and subinvestment grade debt as PDCF collateral.

Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch were among the largest pledgers of low-grade collateral in the turbulent weeks that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.

Morgan Stanley and Merrill declined to comment, but people close to the situation stressed that the loans had been repaid in full and that the collateral met the Fed's requirements.

The European Central Bank also felt obliged to help banks unable to borrow in the financial markets. But by 2010 it was worried that some banks were addicted to obtaining money from the ECB and totally unable to obtain it commercially – see Exhibit 7.13.

# Fears grow over banks addicted to ECB funding

Ralph Atkins and David Oakley

In November last year, Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, had a blunt message for bankers and politicians.

Addressing the annual European banking congress in Frankfurt's palatial 19th century Alte Oper building, he warned that emergency measures were all very well, "but if their use is prolonged, they can lead to dependence and even addiction".

Ten months later, evidence is growing that "addiction" by banks in eurozone countries such as Portugal, Ireland and Greece to ECB liquidity support remains high, and may even have increased.

That is in spite of the improvement in the global economic climate and the boost to confidence in the eurozone financial system that July's bank "stress test" results were supposed to bring.

"In some countries, ECB funding remains critical to the stability of the financial system" says Nick Matthews, European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.

After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008, the ECB started matching in full eurozone banks' demand for liquidity for periods of up to a year. At times, as a result of the emergency strategy - called "enhanced credit support" by the ECB - the total amount lent soared as high as €900bn (\$1,158bn).

Much of the borrowing reflected the paralysis in the financial markets: banks could only borrow from the ECB. But there was also opportunistic borrowing. In June last year the central bank lent €442bn in 12-month liquidity, the highest amount ever injected into the financial system in a single ECB operation, as banks bid heavily for funds that they could use to earn higher returns elsewhere. Since June this year, when that €442bn was repaid, ECB figures show overall lending has fallen gradually. With market interest rates lower than the 1 per cent charged by the ECB, the attractiveness of its liquidity has fallen.

But some banks have been unable to shake the habit. The ECB does not give figures on lending by country. Instead analysts have compiled their own geographical breakdown using data issued by national centre banks in the 16 eurozone countries. These show steep falls recently in countries such as Germany and Austria, but stabilisation at high levels, or even increases in the "peripherals" - Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.

In August, the amount borrowed by Greek banks crept up to €96bn, more than twice as much as a year earlier. Portugal held steady at about €50bn.

Even national data do not show clearly what exactly is happening. Ireland's high figure almost certainly reflects use of ECB liquidity by subsidiaries of foreign banks based in the country. Spain's figures look high - but much less so relative to the size of its economy or banking system. Elsewhere, it is unclear whether the problems are general or focused on a just a few banks.

It is apparent, however, that at least some banks have become locked in a cycle of dependency - and no coincidence that they are mainly in those eurozone countries where worries about spiralling public debt also have been greatest. Weaknesses in banking systems have

Dependence growing on borrowing from the ECB

€bn intensified worries about the eventual cost to taxpayers of the financial crisis. In turn, the bleak economic prospects of countries facing a severe fiscal crunch and a loss of competitiveness relative to Germany have reinforced concerns about those countries' banking systems

The ECB, although urging fiscal discipline and the strengthening of bank systems, does not expect the cycle to be broken soon.

Earlier this month, Mr Trichet announced that the ECB would continue to match in full banks' demand for liquidity for periods of three months or less until at least the start of 2011. Inter-dealer brokers say in the peripheral countries there is little lending beyond one-week between banks in private markets because of continuing worries over counterparty risk.

"The addiction of many European banks, particularly those in the periphery, to the ECB for lending will be hard to break," says Padhraic Garvety, global head of developed markets rates strategy at ING.

# Exhibit 7.13 continued

Private markets remain severely stressed with banks not prepared to risk lending to many institutions, which mean these institutions will have to borrow from the ECB.

In a Financial Times interview last week Mr Trichet argued "enhanced credit support" was being phased out, noting that the ECB was no longer providing six-month and 12-month liquidity. As a result, whether it likes it or not, the ECB is being forced by the weaknesses of the eurozone "periphery" to maintain a policy of unlimited liquidity that is having similar effects on the economy as "quantitative easing" in the US or UK.

"Despite the differences in philosophy between the US Federal Reserve and the ECB, the final impact of both their strategies is to put a lid on long term interest rates - and that helps the economy," says

Gilles Moec, European economist at Deutsche Bank.

So far, the ECB sees no inflationary dangers, but that could change. The eurozone economic recovery in the first half of this year surpassed expectations, and appears not to have slowed dramatically in the third quarter.

An extreme form of support for a bank is for the government to nationalise it, as happened with Northern Rock in 2008 and Anglo Irish Bank in 2009. While not fully nationalised, more than 80 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland's shares and 43 per cent of Lloyds Bank shares are now owned by the UK taxpayer.

# Too big to fail

The danger with having a lender of last resort facility available to banks is that it might encourage banks to take high risks. If their bets are successful then the managers and their shareholders reap the reward; if they fail they are bailed out by the central bank or government. This is a moral hazard problem – encouraging bad behaviour. The problem for the rest of society is not too great when it comes to small banks, whose failure would not cause knock-on failures of other banks or financial institutions. The authorities often let these go bust and impose pain on the managers (lose jobs), shareholders (lose all value in their shares) and bond holders (bonds become worthless), to encourage other banks to believe that they will not be saved regardless of incompetence or recklessness. The problem arises with the large banks, which have numerous interbank and other borrowings and derivative transactions which could pose a threat to the entire system should they fail – because if they go then many of their counterparties might lose so much in the fallout (liquidity-wise or solvency-wise) that they fail too. These are the banks that pose a systemic risk. Rather than size being the relevant criterion, we should really focus on degree of importance and significance of the bank, dubbed 'too important to fail'. The phrase 'too big to fail' has stuck with the media, but increasingly policy makers are using Sifi – systemically important financial institutions.

The regulators frequently face a difficult decision. For example, in 2008 Bear Stearns was saved because it was seen as necessary to step in and save the bank. Then along comes the failing Lehman Brothers asking for help. Rightly or wrongly the authorities felt that Lehman could be allowed to go without money from the central bank or government being pumped in to save it. Many now believe this was an error, that Lehman posed a very high systemic risk which went unrecognised until it was too late (more on this story in Chapter 16).

Governments and regulators are grappling with the problem of having so many banks that are too big to fail. Should we break them up into smaller units so that each individual unit can go bust without any systemic/domino effect? Should we tax them more because of the costs they impose on society? Should we impose very high capital reserve ratios and liquidity reserve ratios (and make them even higher for the most risky activities) to reduce the likelihood of liquidation? Should we introduce living wills, whereby banks have to report regularly to the authorities on how they would put into effect an orderly winding down of the business as well as how they would plan for recovery in a crisis?[6] – see Exhibit 7.14.

# Banks' survival rates should improve with living wills

FT

By Charles Goodhart

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been much concern about the massive bail-out costs. We believe that the authorities, under the exceptional circumstances in late 2008, had no choice but to support the financial system.

But, if anything, the handling of the current financial crisis has reinforced too big to fail doctrine. So how can one reduce moral hazard and reduce expectations of future bail-outs?

We propose the use of living wills to curtail too-big-to-fail, perhaps even thereby allowing systemically important banks, such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs or Barclays, to fail or, at least, to be unwound. The aim is to put in place, ex ante, conditions that would allow a wider range of options beyond having the whole bank rescued.

# In the recent banking crisis, the authorities, almost without exception, acted purely on the basis of narrow national interest

Living wills can play a vital role in the post-crisis world. Take the definition of a systemically important financial intermediary (SIFI). The need for special treatment of such SIFIs plays, for example, a central role in the recently enacted Dodd-Frank financial reform act in the US. But we do not know how to distinguish between a SIFI and an intermediary that is not a SIFI, and we suspect that the distinction between what is systemic, and what is not, will be fluid, varying over time depending on conditions. The fuzzy outlines of the definition of "systemic" are likely to force upon regulatory authorities more discre tionary decisions than either they, or the regulated, will find comfortable.

What we do know, however, is that the set of systemic financial intermediaries overlaps the set of cross-border financial intermediaries. So, a need to resolve a systemic financial institution in difficulties will imply an equivalent requirement for handling cross-border problems. Yet, when there was a need for such resolution in the recent crisis – for example, Lehman, RBS, Fortis and the Icelandic banks – the authorities, almost without exception, acted purely on the basis of narrow national interest. This gross incompatibility, between the (global) cross-border reality and national regulatory/legal attempts to respond, represents a glaring weakness in the world's financial system. It should not be allowed to persist. So how do we proceed to reconcile the global, cross-border reality of SIFIs with the inevitable national focus of regulation? Perhaps the most important new instrument in the global armoury for this purpose will be the requirement for cross-border SIFIs to complete a living will.

What are the key elements of such living wills? First, there should be discussions between the senior management of a bank and its supervisors about requiring a cross-border SIFI to simplify its often opaque structure, particularly to facilitate it being wound down in a really serious crisis. But before that stage may be reached, the living will will also require the bank to make contingent funding and de-risking plans to recover. Next, if that should fail, credible resolution plans should be drawn up to keep a bank alive, if needed. In the case of international banks, these plans could include a burden sharing mechanism for central banks (liquidity support) and ministries of finance (capital support). The burden sharing should be agreed on an institution by institution basis. Third, a bankruptcy scenario might help to bring possible shortcomings in deposit guarantee schemes and inconsistencies between insolvency regimes to the forefront of attention before the event pressurising the authorities (including lawmakers) to tackle such inconsistencies occurs.

# Countries should dig into the legal nitty-gritty and design a common and credible cross-border insolvency regime

But we believe that living wills, though an essential future component of a satisfactory global financial system, will not be enough by themselves. In addition, there needs to be a common insolvency framework, should (parts of) an institution need to be put into liquidation. A major barrier, at present, is the patchwork of different legal structures, controlling such insolvencies, in all such countries. The insolvency procedure for international banks is currently a nightmare for depositors, creditors, and shareholders, but a paradise for insolvency lawyers.

Could we not take this opportunity to devise, introduce and enact identical laws in all major countries? There are precedents; the acceptance in the law of many countries of the close-out netting clauses of an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement for settling outstanding derivative contracts in the event of one of the parties' failure to make a payment or bankruptcy is one.

# Exhibit 7.14 continued

Even so, countries should dig into the legal nitty-gritty and design a common and credible cross-border insolvency regime for systemic banks, that is if countries really want to curtail the current too big - or, too complex - to fail practice.

The too big to fail problem is particularly acute with an international bank made up of branches (where capital and liquid assets are kept in a single country) rather than a collection of self-sufficient subsidiaries – see Exhibit 7.15.

# Exhibit 7.15

# Multinationals weigh up Turner proposals

FT

# Brooke Masters

Large multinational banks that organise themselves as a constellation of self-sufficient subsidiaries could be candidates for lower capital requirements than those that operate as fully integrated global groups, Lord Turner, chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, said yesterday.

Lord Turner's proposal, discussed at a UK forum on how to deal with banks that are seen as "too big to fail", could offer significant competitive advantages to banks such as Santander, owner of the Abbey National in the UK, and to a lesser extent Standard Chartered.

By contrast, banks that rely on integrated treasury functions with complex reporting and legal lines that cross national borders are likely to face higher capital require ments to counteract what are seen as the greater risks they pose. Such banks could well include Barclays, the global investment banks and, to a lesser extent, HSBC.

"There may be a trade-off here between greater internal separation and higher levels of whole group capital," Lord Turner said.

Traditionally, UK regulators have allowed the branches and subsidiaries of large multinational banks to use capital and liquidity held at the group level to satisfy national requirements.

But the financial crisis revealed the problems with this approach. The collapse of Lehman Brothers left its UK subsidiary with insufficient capital to even pay daily bills. And when the Icelandic banks collapsed, the UK government had to step in to protect UK depositors who had money in branches and subsidiaries in this country.

The FSA has already begun pressuring non-UK banks to hold more capital and liquid assets in the UK as part of its tighter supervision of banks in the wake of the crisis. And regulators around the world have begun talking about higher overall capital requirements for systemically important groups.

Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of Abbey National, conceded the stand-alone subsidiary structure was "more expensive" but argued it had advantages. "It creates a solid liquidity and capital base and makes sure there is appropriate burdens-sharing … This acts as a firewall to prevent contagion."

# Bank supervision

It is important that an authority investigates and approves the appointment of those who operate banks and continues monitoring and surveillance to ensure they are operated well. This is bank supervision or prudential supervision. Banks can be powerful money-grabbing tools in the hands of crooks. They can also be a temptation to over-ambitious entrepreneurs who may see a large pot of (depositors') money that could be used to invest in speculative ventures. Thus, the authorities (often central banks) license or charter all banks (and other deposit-taking institutions) to ensure that they are run by fit and proper persons. In this way any proposal for a new bank is scrutinised, as are the controllers of the bank. The regulator then requires regular reports and makes regular visits to the banks to ensure that there is compliance with the safety rules. This usually includes aspects shown in Exhibit 7.16.

The central bank may also consider whether consumers are sufficiently well protected against unfair selling, bad advice, poor quality products, as well as discrimination (e.g. racial). It may also look at whether the bank's electronic systems are safe against cyber attack, e.g. criminals hacking into accounts and stealing money.

If, on examination, a bank performs badly on any of the CAMELS factors, the regulator will order it to correct its behaviour. In extreme cases the bank will be closed.

It is not always the case that the central bank acts as the main supervisor of banks. In the UK, the Financial Services Authority is the primary bank supervisor until 2013 when responsibility (apart from consumer protection aspects) will be handed over to the BoE.

# Capital and liquidity adequacy

Banks know that they would be foolish to lend out all the money they take as deposits. It makes sense to have self-imposed rules on what proportion to keep in cash and what proportion to keep in short-term securities (e.g. money market instruments) that could fairly quickly be turned into cash. However, banks are foolish from time to time and are tempted away from the rational path and therefore need externally imposed rules to prevent them from stepping over the line that takes them into imprudent territory. Holding cash and short-term lending is usually less profitable than long-term lending and so ambitious bankers, looking to boost profits, sometimes transfer more of their resources to long-term lending, leaving only a small buffer of cash or near-cash to meet immediate extraordinary cash outflows should, say, large numbers of depositors insist on a return of their money. In other words, they take excessively high liquidity risk.

The other major risk is solvency risk. This is less to do with running out of cash in the immediate future and more to do with allowing the capital base of the bank to diminish to such an extent that the assets of the bank (loans to customers, etc.) are barely greater than the liabilities (e.g. deposits). In such a situation it would not take too many bad debt write-offs as customers go bust, for example, for the bank to find that it cannot repay all its depositors and other creditors. Other events that could reduce assets below liabilities include a collapse in value of the bank's complex securities holdings, fraud, or the failure of a subsidiary.

Thus, it is possible for a bank to look good on a liquidity perspective – plenty of cash in the vault – but nevertheless its liabilities exceed its assets. Conversely, a bank could have plenty of capital, as assets greatly exceed liabilities, but run out of cash in the short term due to a large outflow over a matter of days. Obviously lowering both liquidity risk and solvency risk is important to the well-being of the financial system.

I remember an impassioned debate in 2008 as one bank after another called on their central banks for funds. The managers would declare that the only issue facing them was a short-term decline in cash balances: they had grown used to drawing loans from the money market on a daily basis and suddenly these were now closed. At first the central banks agreed and supplied the needed cash. There were sceptical voices in the press saying that the loss of bank assets, as households found they could not repay their mortgages and as corporate loans turned sour (particularly those lent to property developers), meant that the buffer of capital was diminishing by the day, to the point where many banks were headed towards negative equity territory. We witnessed a rapid morphing from a liquidity crisis into a bank solvency crisis. As the economy spiralled downwards it became plain for all to see that there was going to be such a volume of loan impairments and financial instrument counterparty defaults that banks desperately needed more equity capital injected into them to widen the gap between assets and liabilities to a safe level.

# A safe reserve level

The questions regulators have grappled with for many decades are: what is a safe level for capital reserves? And what is a safe level for liquidity reserves? If we look at capital reserves first we can start our thinking by recognising that some assets held by a bank have little or no risk of default. Obviously, as cash has no risk of default there is no need to keep a capital buffer for this asset. Some types of loans made by banks, e.g. lending to the German, UK or US governments, have some degree

Lending to a manufacturer, however, usually has a fairly high level of default. It is clear that we need different amounts of capital depending on the asset category. Thus, the total of all unsecured corporate loans a bank holds might need to be backed up with, say, 8 per cent of the balance sheet value composed of capital, whereas the loans to local government lending needs to be backed up with only, say, 1.6 per cent of the value in the form of capital.

This line of thought is leading us to the concept of risk-weighted assets. Thus, if the 'normal' capital proportion put aside is 8 per cent for loans such as unsecured corporate debt, this is given a weighting of 100 per cent, i.e. it is not reduced from the full 8 per cent. So a £10 million loan needs the bank to have £800,000 of capital – of course, the bank will also source money from depositors, etc. to lend the £10 million. A total of £10 billion of loans needs £800 million. The weight for mortgages might be only 50 per cent, which means that if the bank holds £5 billion of mortgages it has to back that with capital of £200 million (0.08 × 0.50 × £5bn). The holding of government bills issued by a developing country as bank assets might require only 20 per cent of the full capital safety reserve – the risk weighting is 20 per cent. Thus, a collection of £3 billion of bills will require £3bn × 0.20 × 0.08 = £48 million

Another way of looking at this is to first reduce the asset values by their risk weighting and then take 8 per cent of the risk-weighted value - see Exhibit 7.17.

Exhibit 7.17 A bank's capital risk weighting

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Full balance sheet value £m</td><td>Risk weighting \%</td><td>Risk weighted value £m</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>100</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>T-bills</td><td>3,000</td><td>20</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Mortgages</td><td>5,000</td><td>50</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>Unsecured loans</td><td>10,000</td><td>100</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>18,100</td><td></td><td>13,100</td></tr></table>

Total capital required: £13,100m × 0.08 = £1,048 million Thus, bank assets must exceed bank liabilities by £1,048 million to withstand the possibility of a substantial proportion becoming bad loans.

# Basel I

Capital reserve levels are not just national affairs because banking is international. The 'banker to the central banks' is the Bank for International Settlements, based in Basel, Switzerland. The central bankers gathered together in the 1980s to discuss setting minimum solvency standards applicable to any bank from a member country of the Basel committee. Now the 'Basel rules' have been adopted in more than 100 countries.

To understand the Basel rules you need to first deal with a point of difficulty I have so far skipped over: defining what we mean by capital. The Basel I committee split capital into two: tier 1 and tier 2.

# Tier 1:

Equity capital placed in the bank by shareholders when they purchase shares.

- Additional equity capital created from retained profits over the years.
- Non-cumulative perpetual preference shares. Because they do not form a liability payable should the bank have a bad run of luck – they do not have to be redeemed, nor do dividends have to be paid – they can act as a buffer against a drop in asset values.
- Minority interests in subsidiaries whose accounts are consolidated in the group accounts (less goodwill and other intangible assets).

One half of capital had to be tier 1 (4 per cent of risk-weighted assets), but the other 4 per cent could be tier 2. Tier 2 consisted of various balance sheet elements that might also act as a (less effective) buffer, such as cumulative perpetual preference shares, revaluation reserves and subordinated debt that did not have to repaid for at least five years (being subordinated, on liquidation, depositors and other creditors would be paid first).

Banks regarded as being undercapitalised under the Basel rules might have been seized by national authorities in the worst case. However, it was more likely that the country's regulator insisted will insist on guiding them back to health, which could include rights issues to raise more equity capital, asset sales, subsidiary sales and the sacking of executives.

# Basel II

In the late 1990s regulators and bankers concluded that the Basel I rules were too simplistic because they took broad categories of loan and insisted that the same risk weight apply to each. Thus, when any bank from an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country borrowed, the lending was regarded as having the same risk weighting (i.e. 20 per cent) as for all other OECD banks, regardless of whether it was a US bank or from a more risky country. The risk weighting for this type of loan was much lower than lending to multinational corporations whose loans were often given a 100 per cent weight, yet most observers would agree that many multinationals are safer borrowers than some banks in some OECD countries. Another bone of contention was that Basel I did not properly differentiate between a loan to a company with a AAA credit rating and one to a company with a much lower rating – they all carried the same weight. This led to a form of regulatory arbitrage in which, within a category (same risk weight), banks mostly could be tempted to lend to the riskiest clients because this paid the highest interest without requiring any more capital than a low-risk low-interest-rate loan.

Basel II was launched in the mid-2000s and made much greater use of credit ratings of both government debt and corporate debt to decide weightings. Thus, AAA or AA debt would get a zero weighting, whereas grades of Bor less would get a 150 per cent weighting. It went further and recognised that a high proportion of bank assets did not have credit ratings and so banks were permitted to use 'internal ratings' devised from their own models to risk-weight assets (subject to monitoring by their national central banks). Also, Basel II took account of market risk (the risk that financial market assets, such as securitised bonds, can decrease in price on the markets) and operational risk (the way the bank is run can lead to calamity, e.g. a rogue trader destroys the bank, or there are other operational dangers, e.g. another 9/11 attack could damage a bank's access to finance). Banks were required to disclose some other risks, such as concentration risk (too many eggs in one basket) and liquidity risk.

Also, there are a number of off-balance-sheet assets (and liabilities) for which capital needs to be assigned. Thus, the holding of positions in derivatives, or positions in the foreign exchange market or commodity market, or commercial letters of credit and bank guarantees creates the possibility of loss and so could erode capital. Under Basel II these items were risk-weighted and added to the on-balance-sheet assets.

Unfortunately, Basel II was not a success. Surprise, surprise, once the banks were able to use their own valuation and risk models to influence the regulatory capital level, the amount they held fell. Well, you see, bankers were so smart that they had diversified away much of the risk, or they had bought insurance so that if a loan went bad the insurer paid up. Lower risk, therefore lower risk weighting. Perfect. Except they forgot to account for the possibility of asset returns all going down together (so much for diversification) or for the insurers/derivative counterparties going bust and not paying out.

# Basel III

Basel II was rapidly overtaken by events: the financial crisis revealed that many banks had not been cautious enough in setting their capital and liquidity reserves. The regulatory framework simply did not work. The rules were complicated, carefully calculated from detailed formulae, but as with so much in finance, the answers were precisely wrong rather than roughly right. Only five days before Lehman's went bust it had a tier 1 capital ratio of 11 per cent. There was far too much optimism, far too much faith in the reported market value of assets, and far too little recognition of the possibility that the new-fangled financial instruments can lose value overnight and that, when they do so, many banks experience knock-on effects and they all collapse together in an enmeshed mass. Banks had moved so far away from simple deposit taking and lending into weird and dangerous securities that it was difficult for the regulators to keep up. Banks would deliberately structure an obligation so that it could be granted a low risk weighting, even though the bankers knew that the real exposure was high. For example, if you took a group of mortgages that had a risk weighting of 50 per cent and converted it into securitised bonds with a AAA rating, you could sell them to other investors, taking them off the balance sheet. You could then replace the asset by buying other banks' AAA-rated mortgage-backed bonds and you no longer needed to hold much capital reserve for them. Risk just seemed to disappear from the system. There is more on the crisis in Chapter 16.

At the time of writing Basel III is being designed and rolled out. This is much tougher. First, the definition of what can be called capital has been narrowed to exclude virtually everything other than money put in by bank shareholders or kept in the bank on behalf of shareholders from retained earnings. This is called core tier 1 and leaves out preference shares, unsecured bonds, etc. Second, instead of tier 1 being 4 per cent of risk-weighted assets and tier 2 being 4 per cent of risk-weighted assets we have the requirement that tier 2 capital be completely left out of the picture and that core tier 1 be effectively raised to 7 per cent, from the previous typical level of 2 per cent. The picture is a little more complicated than that – as shown in Exhibit 7.18.

# Exhibit 7.18 Basel III core tier 1 capital to be held by banks as a percentage of risk-weighted assets

'Minimum'

4.5\%

Simply to operate as a bank this is required (up from  $2\%$  under Basel II)

'Conservation buffer'

2.5\%

Any bank that wants to pay a dividend or bonuses to staff must have  $4.5\%$  plus  $2.5\%$

'Countercyclical buffer'

0 - 2.5\%

National regulators may impose this extra requirement in boom times to counter the effects of a bubble

'Systemic groups' buffer

1 - 2\%

(estimated, still in discussion)

The systemically important financial institutions (super-sized or key players) that pose a global risk have to hold more

Those undertaking risky activities, especially trading financial instruments such as securitised bonds in the market, face much higher capital requirements under Basel III. The capital reserve levels shown in Exhibit 7.18 are to be required in normal times. In a financial crisis regulators expect the buffer to be partially used up – thus it might fall to the minimum 4.5 per cent level.

These new rules are to be phased in over the period until the end of 2018. For 2013-2015 the minimum (simply to operate as a bank) is to be gradually raised to 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets. In the four years after 2015 the conservation buffer will be phased in on top of the minimum until the full 7 per cent is reached. This seems a leisurely timetable, but many central banks have already signalled that they expect their banks to achieve the targets much faster than this - see Exhibit 7.19.

# Exhibit 7.19

# Basel III rules behind StanChart capital raising

Patrick Jenkins

Surprise was the general response of analysts and investors after Standard Chartered unveiled its  $\S 3.3\mathrm{bn}$  rights issue.

Why would a bank with strong capital ratios and solid profitability raise fresh capital, when so many other banks with weaker ratios and profitability have insisted they will not tap shareholders?

StanChart is only the second group, after Deutsche Bank, to launch a rights issue following disclosure of the new, tougher Basel III rules on bank capital published last month.

To an extent, there is a bank-specific explanation, given that StanChart's focus on emerging markets gives it strong growth momentum, in contrast with the contraction mode many banks are in following the financial crisis.

"How do we simultaneously take advantage of growth opportunities and meet the new capital requirements?" said Peter Sands, chief executive. "This is the right thing to do. The logic of it all makes sense. Investors understand it."

They might understand it, but they were still surprised. Many had expected StanChart, like most banks, to build up retained earnings over the coming years, and gradually come into line with the new Basel III requirements, which will be phased in by 2019.

Those rules in essence say that a bank's core tier one capital ratio - which measures equity and other core capital as a proportion of risk-weighed assets - should be 7 per cent, with an as-yet undefined top-up, expected to be up to 2 per cent, for big, systemically important banks.

"This is the right thing to do. The logic of it makes sense. Investors understand it."

By raising a fresh  $\S 3.3\mathrm{bn}$  StanChart will take its existing 9 per cent ratio to about 11 per cent, although changes in the way the ratio is calculated - narrowing the definition of core capital and increasing the risk weightings on some assets - will cut that back to about 10 per cent.

Mr Sands would not say where he wanted the ratio to be, but one person close to the bank said: "In future you will want to operate at 11 or 12 per cent."

Retained earnings should allow the bank to reach that level within a couple of years, bankers said.

Moving to such an inflated level of capital is not just a matter of wanting to maintain a margin of error above the Basel minimum. "For StanChart, which has big operations in Singapore and Hong Kong, the unwritten regulatory rule in those jurisdictions is that the ratio will be at 11 per cent or more," said one adviser. "A lot of regional peers already have higher levels of capital."

That is important in a world where local regulators are demanding more of a focus on local levels of capital and liquidity.

After the collapse of Lehman Brothers two years ago, and the squabble between countries, particularly the UK and US over the bank's assets, regulators are insistent that multinational groups must not hoard all their eggs in one central basket.

Analysts at Credit Suisse said on Wednesday that StanChart's previous level of capital, though relatively robust, would have been insufficient to maintain the level of growth evident in the first half of the year, when risk-weighted assets expanded by an annualised 18 per cent, and at the same time hoard capital to build up capital ratios.

The peculiarities of StanChart's business focus, and its relatively cautious financial management, limited the read-across for the likelihood of capital raising by other banks, analysts said.

HSBC, the closest parallel, is more strongly capitalised already, with an existing core tier one ratio of close to 10 per cent, and less marked asset growth.

But banks' share prices on Wednesday looked like a proxy for the market's view of their relative strength.

Analysts highlighted capital weaknesses at French banks, particularly Crédit Agricole, but also Société Générale, whose shares were among the biggest fallers among European banks. Among UK peers, Barclays was the weak performer, although its management is known to believe there is no need to raise fresh equity and is planning instead to boost capital with retained profits.

"So far," said one investment banker who has worked on a recent rights issue, "everybody has been saying 'we don't need any money, we don't need any money, we don't need any money.' I'm curious to see what impact the StanChart rights issue has on those views."

Some countries have already been explicit in stating that they will go further than the Basel committee recommendations. Switzerland, with bank assets many times greater than national GDP, is insisting that UBS and Credit Suisse expand the conservation buffer from 2.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. However, three percentage points of that may be in the form of a new type of capital called contingent convertible (CoCos) instruments. These behave like bonds, paying a coupon, but convert to equity if a bank's capital ratio falls below a predetermined level. The Swiss are also insisting on a 6 per cent systemic groups' buffer, rather than 1-2 per cent. That is a total of 19 per cent of risk-weighted assets as a capital buffer! At least it does not intend to add a counter-cyclical buffer as well. UK regulators have signalled that UK banks will also be subject to higher capital ratios than under Basel II – the current expectation is that 10 per cent will be the minimum core tier 1 ratio.

The Basel III rules are already resulting in shifts in banks' balance sheets - see Exhibit 7.20.

Megan Murphy and Brooke Masters

With global reforms set to force banks to hold more capital against riskier kinds of financial assets, the world's biggest investment banks have begun to embrace a new buzzword: mitigation.

The Basel III rules endorsed by the Group of 20 leading economies last week may be squeezing banks on multiple fronts. But one of the most difficult changes to gauge is how the rules will inflate banks' risk-weighted assets, and whether lenders can trim balance sheets without hurting their bottom lines.

Over the third-quarter results season, most leading banks disclosed projections of how the new rules would increase their RWAs, with estimates ranging from a

60-70 per cent uplift at some of the big Swiss banks, to 20-30 per cent at JPMorgan Chase, and as much as 80 per cent at "pure-play" investment banks such as Morgan Stanley.

But by mitigating - selling off or otherwise reducing the amount of riskier assets held - most banks also believe that they can limit

# Exhibit 7.20 continued the impact of the reforms without significantly harming earnings.

Some of the easiest ways for banks to reduce their RWAs is to shut down or limit their exposure to business lines that will attract a higher risk weighting, such as so-called correlation trading, structured credit and asset securitisation.

Steering derivatives trading through centrally cleared exchanges, rather than over the counter trading, can also have a big impact.

McKinsey, the global consultancy, says that the rule-changes will also force banks to spend far more on calculating and tracking risk. The average mid-sized European bank, for example, will spend between €45m and €70m simply on IT and people to comply with the new regulations.

Financial institutions will almost certainly try to substitute similar but lower-risk products wherever possible, the consultancy says.

Bankers may well try to shift short-term corporate lending from receivables financing to factoring, which has a lower risk-weighting and therefore requires less capital, the report says. They may also try to convince large corporate borrowers to shift from loans to bonds because the latter generate fees without adding to the stock of assets that must be supported by capital.

McKinsey also argues that banks can cut their requirements by using more sophisticated measures of risk and new systems to allocate liquidity based on potential profits.

# Basel III on liquidity risk

Basel III also deals with liquidity – the ability to pay out cash on deposit withdrawals and other outflows of cash while satisfying loan commitments and other obligations. Liquidity management consists of two parts:

- Asset management Making sure there is enough cash and near-cash available at any one time.
- Liability management Obtaining liquid resources quickly and avoiding excessive outflows of cash to repay creditors in the near term. For example, the bank maintains access to the money markets and obtains additional funds for liquidity by borrowing there if required – it needs to offer only a slightly higher interest rate than others to obtain billions almost instantly. That is the theory at least, but we now have less faith in this method than bankers did before 2008 because all of a sudden no one was lending in these markets. The other aspect of liability management is not to have a high proportion of liabilities maturing in the next few months or years. Thus, long-term bond issues are to be favoured with a spread of maturities over many years.

The Basel III rules insist that banks maintain a high 'liquidity coverage ratio', that is enough cash and near-cash to survive a 30-day market crisis on the same scale as the Lehman-induced crisis - a complete freeze in the money markets so the bank cannot access borrowed cash. However, because many banks lobbied their governments hard saying that they could not reach this level of liquidity quickly without significantly reducing lending the implementation of this new rule has been delayed until 2015. Until then it is 'observational', regulator-speak for monitoring, as banks work their way up to the standard to see if there are serious unintended consequences. No politician wanted to take the slightest chance of reduced lending at a time when we were trying to recover from recession.

The other liquidity risk-reducing measure is known as the 'net stable funding rule'. It seeks to reduce banks' dependence on short-term funding. Another Northern Rock fiasco is what the regulators are trying to avoid: it borrowed on the short-term money market to lend long-term for mortgages, and then the short-term market froze. The new rule will not apply until 2018 because of the current weakness of the banks in some countries.

The current direction of travel is much more focused on macro-prudential regulation than previously, that is, trying to reduce systemic risks rather than assuming that a sound system can be built by focusing only on supervising individual banks (micro-prudential regulation). One aspect of this is to prevent bubbles building up in the financial system (e.g. irrational optimism about the increasing value of a group of assets, e.g. houses). Hence the extra capital added in boom times (a counter-cyclical regulatory capital regime). Another aspect is to prevent contagion across the system: measures here include high capital ratios for all banks at all times and inspections to ensure limited exposure to any one counterparty bank going bust. However, central banks will have a difficult time explaining to lenders, borrowers and politicians that we should have greater constraints on bank lending when times are good. Politicians are likely to ask, why is the central bank slowing things down when clearly we are not in a bubble (they never see them beforehand), merely booming as a result of the brilliant and beneficent policies that have led us to a new era of faster growth?

There are many sceptical voices concerned that the capital requirements under Basel III still leave the taxpayer vulnerable to picking up the pieces after another banking crisis - see Exhibit 7.21.

# Exhibit 7.21

# Basel: the mouse that did not roar

# FT

# Martin Wolf

To celebrate the second anniversary of the fall of Lehman, the mountain of Basel has laboured mightily and brought forth a mouse. Needless to say, the banking industry will insist the mouse is a tiger about to gobble up the world economy. Such special pleading – of which this pampered industry is a master – should be ignored: withdrawing incentives for reckless behaviour is not a cost to society; it is costly to the beneficiaries. The latter must not be confused with the former. The world needs a smaller and safer banking industry. The defect of the new rules is that they will fail to deliver this.

Am I being too harsh? "Global banking regulators … sealed a deal to … triple the size of the capital reserves that the world's banks must hold against losses," says the FT. This sounds tough, but only if one fails to realise that tripling almost nothing does not give one very much.

The new package sets a risk-weighted capital ratio of 4.5 per cent, more than double the current 2 per cent level, plus a new buffer of 2.5 per cent. Banks whose capital falls within the buffer zone will face restrictions on paying dividends and discretionary bonuses. So the rule sets an effective floor of 7 per cent. But the new standards are also to be implemented fully by 2019, by when the world will probably have seen another financial crisis or two.

This amount of equity is far below levels markets would impose if investors did not continue to expect governments to bail out creditors in a crisis, as historical

# Exhibit 7.21 continued public purse and is, as a result, by far the most subsidised in the world.

It is necessary to go back to first principles in assessing the alleged costs of higher capital (and liquidity) requirements.

First, it is untrue that equity is expensive, as another excellent paper by Anat R. Admati of Stanford University and others argues, once we allow for the fact that more equity reduces the risk to creditors and to taxpayers, as we should. Less equity means higher returns, but also higher risk (see chart).

Second, to the extent that creditors bear the costs of failure, more equity means cheaper debt. Thus, if debt were truly unsubsidised, changing the ratio of equity to debt should not affect the costs of funding the balance sheet.

Third, to the extent that taxpayers bear the risk, more equity offsets this implicit subsidy. The public at large has zero interest - in fact, a negative interest - in subsidising risk-taking by banks, in general. For this reason, the subsidy it offers by providing free insurance must be offset by imposing higher capital requirements.

Fourth, the public has an interest in imposing higher equity requirements than any individual bank would, in its own interest, wish to bear. Banks create systemic risk endogenously. That cost must be internalised by the decision makers. More risk-bearing capacity is one way of doing so.

Finally, to the extent that the public wants a specific form of risk-taking subsidised – lending to small and medium-sized enterprise, for example – it should do so directly. To subsidise the banking system as a whole, to persuade it to undertake what is but a small part of its activity, is grotesquely inefficient.

The conclusion, then, is that equity requirements need to be very much higher, perhaps as high as 20 or 30 per cent, without the risk-weighting. It would then be possible to dispense with the various forms of contingent capital that are far more likely to exacerbate panic in a crisis than assuage it. It is only because we have become used to these extraordinarily fragile structures that this demand seems so outrageous.

This is not to deny two huge problems.

One is that any such transition will be like taking drugs from an addict. The simplest way to minimise the costs would be for governments to underwrite the additional capital and then, over time, sell what they take up into the market. Even so, the aggregate balance sheets of the banking system probably need to shrink. Such deleveraging almost certainly means a longer period of large fiscal deficits than almost anybody now imagines.

The other is that there is tremendous potential for regulatory arbitrage, with risks shifted elsewhere in the system. Such risks can easily collapse back on to the banking system. Thus higher capital requirements for banks will only work if regulators are able to identify the emergence of systemic risks elsewhere.

The regulators are trying to make the existing financial system less unsafe, incrementally. That is better than nothing. But it will not create a safe system. The world cannot afford another such crisis for at least a generation. By these standards what is emerging is simply insufficient. This mouse will never roar loudly enough.

# Other activities of central banks

# Banker to the government and national debt management

Central banks usually act as their government's banker. They hold the government's bank account and provide services such as deposit holding. As taxes go in, the account balance rises, but as the government pays private contractors, its account at the central bank will be debited, while the commercial banker to the contractor will see an uplift in its central bank account.

It may also administer the national debt, raising money by selling Treasury bills and bonds. Increasingly this task is undertaken by a separate organisation; in the UK by the Debt Management Office. National debt is the cumulative outstanding borrowings of a government. This can amount to a very large sum of money. Japan's national debt is over 200 per cent of annual GDP, for example. For the UK the figure is over 80 per cent, while Italy and Belgium are already over 100 per cent.

In normal circumstances the central bank will not lend to the government by buying its bonds, but extreme situations have seen a relaxation of that policy - see Exhibit 7.22.

Like a boxer wanting more power for his punch, the European Central Bank is trying a new tactic to combat the eurozone crisis: moving to catch financial markets unawares.

Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, disappointed some investors on Thursday by not announcing a dramatic increase in the bank's bond purchases.

But while he spoke, the euro's monetary guardian was stepping up its intervention in government debt markets to levels not seen since the programme was launched in May.

The feint brought some immediate success in reversing the surge in borrowing costs seen by countries such as Portugal and Spain. But it also kept the main thrust of the ECB's strategy for tackling the crisis on track.

As before, the euro's monetary guardian was not embarking on quantitative easing to stimulate the economy in the manner of the US Federal Reserve, said Mr Trichet. The ECB's aim was to correct malfunctioning markets, not ride to the rescue of struggling eurozone countries.

It would continue to offset any inflationary risks by withdrawing from the financial system the same amount of liquidity as it spend on bonds.

Spending would be "commensurate" with the extent to which the

ECB believed markets were malfunctioning, he said. Tensions were currently "acute". There was no limit to the eventual size of the programme.

"It is pretty cunning because there is a sense that they are not going to commit anything - but they are alert, and if things deteriorate they will act," said Giles Moec, European economist at Deutsche Bank. "For those who position themselves for a continuation of the European debacle, there is a risk."

The calculations behind Mr Trichet's low-key comments were probably also political. The tactics had been approved by an "over

ECB bond weekly purchases (€bn) whelming majority" of the 22-strong governing council in Frankfurt on Thursday, he said. This suggested that Axel Weber, the Bundesbank chief, had maintained his opposition to the programme - although he may have been joined by fewer colleagues than when it was originally agreed. Mr Weber says that buying government bonds muddles fiscal and monetary policies, creating inflation risks and incentives for irresponsible government behaviour.

# Currency issue

Central banks control the issue of bank notes and often control the issue of coins.8 Notes are issued to commercial banks as they demand them, but in return their reserves at the central bank are surrendered. It is important that the central bank has a monopoly over deciding the size of the issue because excess amounts can result in high inflation, while too little can inhibit the economy. In the past, if the economy grew in nominal terms by 6 per cent the central bank would generally issue a further 6 per cent of notes to keep up with the needs of commerce. However, in recent times this relationship has become more complicated as we increasingly use electronic funds transfer rather than cash.

In addition to increasing the volume of notes the central bank stands ready to replace bank-knots that are wearing out.

# Smooth functioning of the payments system

A central bank may run some or all of the payment systems in an economy, such as cheque clearing and for electronic transactions. Those systems it does not run it may oversee as a regulator.

# Currency reserve control

Countries find it prudent to hold a reserve of gold and foreign currencies at their central banks. This can be useful as rainy day money and for intervening in the foreign exchange markets, e.g. using the foreign currency to buy the home currency, thereby increasing demand for it and raising its exchange rate. Even countries that permit a floating exchange rate (see Chapter 12) may want to smooth out sharp day-to-day fluctuations.

# Coordination with other central banks and international bodies

We have already discussed one form of international cooperation (on solvency and liquidity rules) under the auspices of the BIS at Basel. The BIS also acts as a kind of banker to the central banks. It helps in the transfer of money from one central bank to another and keeps a proportion of the central banks' reserves. Central banks also work with the International Monetary Fund. For example, they worked together on the bail-out of the Irish government in 2010/2011. Another international economic and financial point of discussion and coordination is the regular G20 meetings – gatherings of finance ministers, presidents and prime ministers of the 20 leading economies. Central bankers have a significant input in terms of preparing for the meetings and then may help with the process of implementing agreements.

# Bank of England

The Bank of England is more than 300 years old. Despite its name it is the central bank for the whole of the UK. Originally it was mainly used as the government's bank which raised borrowed money for its master. In Victorian times it was granted a monopoly on the issue of new banknotes and was used to rescue individual banks and the banking system. It also managed the nation's foreign currency and gold reserves.

It is managed by the Court of Directors, which consists of a governor, two deputy governors and nine non-executive directors. Governors are appointed for five years and directors for three years.

The BoE is responsible for the overall stability of the banking system as a whole, which will involve:

- stability of the monetary system. Setting interest rates and dealing with day-to-day fluctuations in liquidity;
- payment systems oversight and strengthening to reduce systemic risk;
- macro-prudential regulation of the financial system as whole;
- authorisation and micro-prudential supervision of banks and other deposit-taking institutions (from 2013);
- note issuance;
- lender of last resort in selected instances - some banks will be allowed to fail;
- managing the UK's gold and currency reserves and intervening in the foreign exchange markets.

Monetary policy is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which consists of the Governor, his two deputies, the Bank's chief economist and director for markets and four outside experts. These experts are drawn from the academic community as well as the world of business (particularly banks). Also, they can and have been non-UK citizens, with expertise being the over riding consideration. The MPC meets each month to decide on the short-term interest rate target. The BoE staff then engage in open market operations in the money market to move the market rates to the desired target. If the inflation rate falls below 1 per cent or rises above 3 per cent then the Governor has to write a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why – see Exhibit 7.23.

By Chris Giles

Mervyn King came under attack from economists yesterday after the Bank of England governor was forced to write to the chancellor to explain another unexpected rise in the rate of inflation.

Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, rose to 3.7 per cent in April - up 0.3 percentage points from March and close to double the Bank of England's 2 per cent target.

On the retail price inflation measure, the annual rise in the cost of living jumped from 4.4 per cent in March to 5.3 per cent in April.

In a letter to George Osborne, chancellor, Mr King again played down concerns, insisting that it was highly likely that the rise in inflation was temporary. He argued that it was caused by one-off factors of sterling weakness, high oil process and January's rise in value added tax.

But his soothing letter was met with increasing concern among economists that the Bank was too relaxed about its over-optimistic inflation forecasts.

Mr King's letter did betray some greater doubt about the temporary nature of the high inflation, unlike his letter in February, which did not suggest there was any chance of it persisting. "If the current period of above-target inflation causes inflation expectations to move up, that may lead to some persistence in the current high levels of inflation," the governor wrote.

In his response to the governor, Mr Osborne urged the Bank to "remain vigilant towards any upside risks to inflation, including the risks to inflation expectations, of any prolonged period of above-target inflation".

# European Central Bank

The ECB, given responsibility for monetary policy in 1999, is part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) (Eurosystem). The National Central Banks (NCBs) were not discarded but remain important parts of the regulatory system. The ECB and the ESCB control monetary policy for those countries that are members of the European Monetary Union, the Eurozone. The governors of each of the 17 NCBs each have a vote on the Governing Council which makes decisions on monetary policy. Each of the NCBs became independent from both the European Commission and the governments of the individual states when the ESCB was established, if they were not already independent.

The ECB, based in Frankfurt, has an executive board consisting of the president, the vice-president and four other members, who are appointed by a committee of heads of state for eight years. These six people are also voting members of the Governing Council. The Governing Council of 23 meets each month to decide monetary policy and announces the target short-term interest (repo) rate (the target financing rate).

Monetary operations are not centralised at the ECB, but are conducted by the individual NCBs. In open market operations (called main refinancing operations (MRO)), banks and other credit institutions submit bids to borrow and the central banks decide which bids to accept – the unattractively priced offers will not be accepted. This is usually in the repo market or secured loans market. For discount lending (marginal lending facility) the national central banks will lend, against collateral, overnight loans at, say, 75 or 100 basis points over the target financing rate, thus providing a ceiling rate in the markets. Banks may also deposit money with the ECB and receive interest, say 75 or 100 basis points below the target financing rate (deposit facility).

The ECB insists that banks hold a sum equivalent to 2 per cent of the amount held in cheque accounts and other short-term deposits in reserve accounts at the national central bank (interest is paid on this money at a low rate, currently 0.25 per cent).

As well as monetary policy, including the issuance of banknotes, the ECB is responsible for the conduct of foreign exchange operations and holds and manages the official reserves (gold and currency) of the Eurozone countries. It also promotes the smooth working of payment systems. Prudential supervision of financial institutions is a responsibility of the NCBs, as are payment mechanisms and the stability of their national financial systems.

# The US Federal Reserve

The Americans have a heightened fear of centralised power and as a consequence emphasise the need for checks and balances in society. One manifestation of their mistrust was the failure of the nineteenth-century experiments with establishing central banks because the public mistrusted such a nationwide system, especially if it could be manipulated by Wall Street money men. Thus for much of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century there was no central bank to act as lender of last resort should banks' reserves get uncomfortably low. As a result there were regular runs on banks and hundreds of bank collapses. The 1907 crisis brought so many bank failures and massive losses to depositors that a consensus was finally reached to create a central bank, which was established in 1913.

However, the Federal Reserve is unlike other central banks because it was structured in such a way as to disperse power to the regions of the country and to disperse power among a number of individuals so that neither Wall Street nor politicians could manipulate it. There are 12 Federal Reserve banks, one for each region of the country. These are overseen by directors who are mostly drawn from the private-sector banks and corporates in that region, so that they reflect the American citizenry. These regional Federal Reserve banks supervise the financial institutions in their area. (The New York one is the busiest on this score, with so many universal banks to watch over.) They also make discount rate loans to banks in their area; issue new currency; clear cheques; supervise the safety and soundness of banks in their area with regard to applications for a bank to expand or merge and investigate and report on local business conditions.

In addition to the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks there is a Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System based in Washington, which has seven members called governors (usually economists), including the chairman, at the time of writing Ben Bernanke. These are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, but for terms much longer than those of the President or members of congress at 14 years, to reduce the chance of political control of a governor.

Monetary policy through the use of open market operations is decided by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) whose voting members include the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board plus the presidents of the New York Fed and four other regional Feds.[10] Thus, there is input from the regions. Note that the Board has the majority of the votes. The FOMC meets about every six weeks to decide the general stance on open market operations (setting the target federal funds rate, which is the interest rate banks charge each other to lend their balances at the Federal Reserve overnight), but the actual day-to-day interventions in the money markets are conducted by the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The manager of this desk reports back to the FOMC members daily.

The Board sets reserve requirements and shares the responsibility with the regional reserve banks for discount rate policy. The Fed now pays interest on reserves. The Board plays a key role in ensuring the smooth functioning and continued development of the nation's payments system. The Board approves bank mergers and applications for new activities, regulates the permissible activities of domestic and foreign banks in the US. However, the safety and soundness of the US financial system is entrusted to a number of different government agencies alongside the Fed.

The chairman and his team have some other duties: advising the nation's president on economic policy;

representing the country in international negotiations on economic matters.

# Concluding comments

In 2010 and 2011 countries all over Europe leaned heavily on the expertise and power of their central banks to bail them out of deep economic difficulties. Their banks were in crisis as the financial markets lost faith in the ability of them or their governments to repay money borrowed through bonds. The European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Eurozone had two years previously slashed interest rates to historic lows and in so doing probably saved the continent from a 1930s-style Depression. This was still not enough to restore the banking system to health and so a raft of additional measures was implemented by the central banks, including raising the deposit insurance limit to reassure depositors and acting as lender of last resort to a number of banks (the Irish banks, for example, borrowed €130 billion from the ECB when no one else would lend). In the UK, we had a massive quantitative easing programme to lower long-term interest rates and boost bank reserves to encourage lending. While these emergency measures were effective in keeping the patient alive, thought was also given to the long-term health of the financial system. Thus we had the Basel tightening of the capital and liquidity reserve ratios.

For most people the technical-sounding tools used by central bankers seem arcane and boring when we hear about them on the evening news. Yet if it wasn't for the vigilance and forward planning of these organisations we would have suffered a much worse fate as a result of the financial crisis. The financial world would have become a wasteland as bank after bank fell, and many important functions such as the mobilisation of savings for productive use would have taken decades to recover. It is vital that we continue to develop ways of strengthening the financial system through better regulation, rules on reserves and controlling the power of over-mighty universal banks. Clearly, the regime central banks put in place prior to 2008 was inadequate – we must do better in the future, for all our sakes.

# Key points and concepts
- Monetary policy: managing the amount of money in an economy and the interest rates in that economy.
Required reserves: a bank's reserves of cash that a central bank insists are deposited with it.
Excess reserves: additional reserves held by a commercial bank above those held at the central bank.
- Monetary base = currency in circulation + reserves
Reserves required reserves vault cash (excess reserves)
Required reserve ratio: reserves as a percentage of deposits.
- The credit multiplier occurs when there is an increase (decrease) in the quantity of reserves in the banking system. The increase (decrease) produces a multiple effect on the amount of money in the economy. It is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio.
Central banks have three main tools they use to increase or decrease the money supply and interest rates:
- Open market operations: the buying and selling of government securities (Treasury bills and bonds) in the normal trading markets on a day to day basis. In purchasing government securities the central bank creates money to hand it over to those selling. It issues currency notes or it writes a cheque in the name of the owner. When the cheque is drawn on, the central bank just creates an amount of credit for itself to satisfy the buyer.
- Discount rate changes: a bank that is temporarily short of reserves could ask the central bank to simply create additional reserves and add them to its account at the central bank. It will pay interest at a significantly higher rate (usually 100 basis points more) than the normal overnight rate.
- Reserve requirement ratio changes: a decrease in the reserve requirement ratio means that banks do not need to hold as much money at the central bank and/or in vault cash, and so they are able to lend out a greater percentage of their deposits, thus increasing the supply of money.
- Some central banks have a specific goal for inflation. For example, the European Central Bank, ECB, has a stated aim of a rate below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term.
Other potential goals of the central bank are:
- high employment and steady economic growth – the best that policymakers can hope for is that the economy reaches its natural rate of unemployment, i.e. a level of non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, NAIRU. There will usually be frictional unemployment (matching people to suitable posts does not happen instantaneously) and some structural unemployment (where the skills people have do not match what the market needs or the location of people does not match the needs of employers);
- interest rate stability;
- stability of the financial system;
- stability in the foreign exchange markets.

Over a run of years the goal of price stability does not conflict with the other goals. But there might be a trade-off in the short run.

There are two types of central bank independence. These are:

- instrument independence – the central bank can decide when and how to use monetary policy instruments without political interference;
- goal independence - the central bank decides the goals of monetary policy.

Advantages of central bank independence are: political control can lead to higher inflation;

- there is reduced temptation to support government spending;
- politicians lack expertise.

The disadvantages of independence are:

- the situation is undemocratic;
- central banks fail from time to time.
- Quantitative easing: the central bank electronically creates money ('printing money') which is then used to buy assets from investors in the market. It can raise bank reserves and lower interest rates along the yield curve.
- Depositor insurance: the government or some regulatory body steps in and says they will guarantee that depositors will be repaid even if the bank cannot do so – a limit is usually set.
- Lender of last resort: to prevent a bank failure leading on to other bank failures the central bank will step in to provide reserves when no one else will lend to the banks.
- Too big to fail: large banks, which have numerous interbank and other borrowings and derivative transactions, could pose a threat to the entire system should they fail. These are the banks that pose a systemic risk. Increasingly policymakers are using the phrase 'Sifi, systemically important financial institutions'. Partial solutions include breaking banks into smaller units, taxing them more because of the costs they impose on society, imposing very high capital reserve ratios and liquidity reserve ratios, introducing living wills (banks have to report regularly to the authorities on how they would put into effect an orderly winding down of the business as well as how they would plan for recovery in a crisis).
- Bank supervision or prudential supervision: an authority investigates and approves the appointment of those who operate banks and continues monitoring and surveillance to ensure they are operated well.

# The CAMELS method of bank inspection:

Capital adequacy;

Asset quality;

- Management;
Earnings;
- Liquidity;
Sensitivity to market risk.
- Liquidity risk: the ability to pay out cash on deposit withdrawals and other outflows of cash while satisfying loan commitments and other obligations. Liquidity management consists of two parts. These are:
- asset management - making sure there is enough cash and near-cash available at any one time;
- liability management – obtaining liquid resources quickly and avoiding excessive outflows of cash to repay creditors in the near-term – e.g. access to the money markets, and not having a high proportion of liabilities maturing in the next few months or years.
- Solvency risk: allowing the capital base of the bank to diminish to such an extent that the assets of the bank (loans to customers, etc.) are barely greater than the liabilities (e.g. deposits).
- Risk-weighted assets: some bank assets are reduced to, say, 50 per cent or 20 per cent of their balance sheet value for the purposes of calculating the value of their assets to then apply the required capital reserve ratio of, say, 7 per cent.
- Basel I: set minimum solvency standards applicable to any bank from a member country of the Basel committee.
- Basel II: made much greater use of credit ratings to decide weightings. Banks were permitted to use 'internal ratings' devised from their own models to risk-weight assets. Took account of market risk, operational risk, concentration risk and liquidity risk. Off-balance-sheet assets (and liabilities) need capital to be assigned.
- Basel III: capital is narrowly defined as core tier 1 and leaves out preference shares, unsecured bonds, etc. Capital is to be held by banks as a percentage of risk-weighted assets: 4.5 per cent minimum; an additional 2.5 per cent if the bank wants to pay dividends or bonuses, an additional 0–2.5 per cent as a counter-cyclical buffer and another 1–2 per cent as a systemic groups' risk buffer.
Contingent convertible ('CoCos'): they behave like bonds, paying a coupon, but convert to equity if a bank's capital ratio falls below a predetermined level.
- Basel III on liquidity risk: (a) banks maintain a high 'liquidity coverage ratio', that is enough cash and near cash to survive a 30-day market crisis, (b) the 'net stable funding rule' seeks to reduce banks' dependence on short-term funding.
Macro-prudential regulation: trying to reduce systemic risks rather than assuming that a sound system can be built by focusing only on supervising individual banks (micro-prudential regulation).
- Counter-cyclical regulatory capital regime: extra capital added to banks' balance sheets in boom times.
Other activities of central banks are:
- as banker to the government, and national debt management;
- currency issuing;
- the smooth functioning of the payments system;
- currency reserve control; coordination with other central banks and international bodies.

Bank of England activities are:

- the stability of the monetary system. Setting interest rates and dealing with day to day fluctuations in liquidity;
- payment systems oversight and strengthening to reduce systemic risk;
- macro-prudential regulation of the financial system as a whole;
- authorisation and micro-prudential supervision of banks and other deposit-taking institutions (from 2013);
- note issuance;
- lender of last resort in selected instances;
- managing the UK's gold and currency reserves and intervening in the foreign exchange markets;
- monetary policy, which is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

European Central Bank, ECB; part of the European System of Central Banks, ESCB (Eurosystem).

The ECB and the ESCB control monetary policy for those countries that are members of the European Monetary Union, the Eurozone.

- The governors of each of the 17 National Central Banks each have a vote on the Governing Council which makes decisions on monetary policy. Also on the Governing Council are six Executive board members of the ECB.

In the US there are 12 Federal Reserve banks, one for each region of the country, which supervise the financial institutions in their area: they make discount rate loans to banks in their area; issue new currency; clear cheques; supervise the safety and soundness of banks in their area with regard to applications for a bank to expand or merge; and investigate and report on local business conditions.

- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System based in Washington has seven members which are all on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which decides open market operations. The FOMC also includes the presidents of the New York Fed and four other regional Feds. The Board sets reserve requirements and shares the responsibility with the regional Reserve Banks for discount rate policy.
