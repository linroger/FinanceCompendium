# Equity Markets

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

This chapter is designed to help you understand the main features of equity capital and the markets on which shares are traded. By the end of it the reader should be able to: compare and contrast equity and debt capital, as well as explain the features of preference shares; discuss the role and functioning of stock markets; describe and explain the recent innovations leading to more equity trading taking place outside the main exchanges;

explain the different markets available to companies on the London Stock Exchange and the way in which shares are traded there; outline the trends in the ownership of UK shares over the past 50 years.

Society needs people who are willing to take the risk of total failure of a business enterprise. Banks are not willing to accept that risk. They strike deals with companies whereby even if the profits are low or a loss is made they are still paid interest and capital. Also, they usually require collateral so that if the business plan turns out to be a dud the bank can recoup its money by selling off property or other assets (or, at least most of their money most of the time). Holders of other forms of debt capital, such as bonds, take similar low-risk/low-return deals.

Imagine if debt were the only form of capital available for businesses to grow. Very few would be established because it would be rare for managers to come across an investment project (e.g. new product-line factory) that offered the lenders the security they need. I can think of only one company that is virtually completely financed by debt. This is the water company for Wales. It can get away without many shares (equity) because there is so little uncertainty regarding its future income. It is regulated and the bills it charges to customers are highly predictable for years to come and so it can offer its lenders high security, not just from its cash flow but also from the land, reservoirs, etc. that it owns.

Now consider a company producing TV programmes. Could it finance itself entirely with debt? No, because if £100 million was put in by lenders to invest in ten TV serials there would be nothing for them to fall back on should half of its shows be poorly received by viewers, or even if one-tenth was poorly received. They might be willing to lend, say, £40 million if the other £60 million came from investors who were willing to accept the risk of total loss. Then the lenders would know that their money was likely to be reasonably safe (assuming that they had faith in the track record of the executives in charge and the historical statistics suggested that only two or three programmes were likely to be commercial flops). Naturally, the risk takers providing this £60 million of capital would want a high reward for exposing their hard-earned savings. They would also want some say over who the directors of the company were and the power to vote down major moves proposed by the managers. They would also require regular information on progress. These holders of shares (equities) in the success or failure of the enterprise act as shock-absorbers so that other parties contributing to a firm, from suppliers and creditors to bankers and leasing companies, do not have to bear the shock of a surprise recession, a loss of market share to competitors or a badly made TV series.

Another attractive feature of share capital for building businesses is that it does not have a date at which it will be redeemed by the company. Thus the managers (and creditors) know that the capital will be available for the very long term, that the shareholders cannot turn around one day and demand their money back. However, this causes a problem for investors because they may want to sell their shares a year or two down the line. While many shareholders are willing to accept that their companies are too small to join a stock market or that the disadvantages of doing so outweigh the advantages, a minority of companies have decided to float their shares on an exchange. This brings many benefits in addition to permitting shareholders to sell (or buy more) when they want to, including facilitating mergers and the raising of more equity finance.

After discussing the different types of long-term capital available to a company this chapter describes stock exchanges around the world and their importance. Challenges to the old established exchanges such as new share-trading facilities set up in the last five years, or high-frequency trading and dark pools of liquidity are also explored. We then look at the London Stock Exchange in more detail, comparing it to the other major exchanges. Also, the ways in which shares are traded are discussed, including the role of clearing houses and settlement systems.

## The value of joint stock enterprises/a little history

Although it is thought that Roman publicani (state contractors) carried out some active trading in parts of their businesses, it was in seventeenth-century Europe that the first shares were issued and traded, and the first stock exchange was founded in Amsterdam. These shares were in the Vereinigte Oostindische Compagnie (the Dutch East India Company). The oldest VOC share still in existence was issued on 27 September 1606 (see Exhibit 8.1).

The opening of routes to the east saw a huge surge in spice trading, with groups of merchants pooling their resources to finance voyages in the hope of significant profits. This collective investing – buying shares in a trading company – lessened their exposure to risk and there were plenty of wealthy individuals eager to purchase the shares.

In the UK, trading in securities began in 1698 when a John Castaing based at Jonathan's Coffee-house published a list of share and commodity prices called 'The Course of the Exchange and other things'. A club, formed at Jonathan's in 1801 to deal in shares and made up of subscribing members, was called the Stock Exchange.

Shares enabled companies to expand to take advantage of the industrial age by attracting investors to buy equity in the companies in return for a share in the profits. As the sums needed to finance this expansion grew ever larger, financing by means of equities proved to be a satisfactory solution.

## Ordinary shares (equity)

Ordinary shares represent the equity capital of the firm and are a means of raising long-term finance to run the business. The holders of these securities share in the (hopefully) rising prosperity of a company. These investors, as owners of the firm, have the right to exercise some control over the company. They can vote at shareholder meetings to determine such crucial matters as the composition of the team of directors. They can also vote on major strategic and policy issues such as the type of activities that the firm might engage in, or the decision to merge with another firm. These ordinary shareholders have a claim to a share of the company's profits in the form of dividend payments, and in a worst-case scenario, a right to share in the proceeds of a liquidation sale of the firm's assets, albeit after all other creditors such as banks, tax authorities, trade creditors etc. have been paid.

Limited liability means that investors are liable for the company's debts only up to the amount they invested. It was in the nineteenth century that the idea of limited liability emerged. It encouraged investors to put their savings into shareholdings without the risk that if the company failed investors would be liable for all company liabilities, at a time when many investment opportunities carried great risk, for example railway building in Europe or the Americas.

To exercise effective control over the firm the shareholders need information; and while management are reluctant to put large amounts of commercially sensitive information which might be useful to competitors into the public domain, they are required to make available to each shareholder a copy of the annual report.

To regain invested funds an equity investor must either sell the shares to another investor (or in rare circumstances to the company – in many countries firms are now allowed to repurchase their own shares, a share buy-back, under strict conditions) or force the company into liquidation, in which case all assets are sold and the proceeds distributed.

Annual, semi-annual or quarterly dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the directors, and individual shareholders are often effectively powerless to influence the income from a share – not only because of the risk attached to the trading profits which generate the resources for a dividend, but also because of the relative power of directors in a firm with a disparate or divided shareholder body. If a shareholder owns 100 shares of a company with millions of shares in issue, there is little likelihood of this person exerting any influence at all; institutional shareholders who often own very large numbers of shares are able to bring more pressure to bear.

## Contrasting equity and debt finance

Debt is another means of raising finance, but it is very different from equity finance. Usually the lenders to the firm have no official control; they are unable to vote at general meetings and therefore cannot choose directors and determine major strategic issues. However, there are circumstances in which lenders have significant influence. For instance, they may insist that the company does not exceed certain liquidity or solvency ratio levels (not too much debt), or they may take a charge over a particular building as security for a loan, thus restricting the directors' freedom of action over the use and disposal of that building. Debt finance also contrasts with equity finance in that it usually requires regular cash outlays in the form of interest and the repayment of the capital sum, whereas equity finance is not compelled to make any dividend payments. The firm will be obliged to maintain the repayment schedule through good years and bad or face the possibility of action being taken by the lender to recover its money by forcing the firm to sell assets or liquidate. With equity finance, in bad times dividend payments can be suspended to aid cash flow.

The attraction of holding shares is that if the company does well there are no limits to the size of the claim equity shareholders have on profit. There have been numerous instances of investors placing modest sums into the shares of young firms and finding themselves millionaires. For example, if you had bought 1,000 worth of shares in Google in 1999, your holding would now be worth millions.

The attraction of share issuing for companies is that, unlike a loan, share finance does not have to be repaid, which can be helpful if the company is short of cash. Offsetting this are some disadvantages: issuing shares is a costly business (share investors require higher rates of return and the transaction costs of the issue process can be high - see next chapter on the costs of share issuance); issuing shares to external investors may mean loss of ultimate control of the company by the current dominant shareholders.

There is some lack of clarity as to the distinction between stocks and shares. Shares are equities in companies. Stocks are financial instruments that pay interest (e.g. bonds). However, in the US shares are also called 'common stocks' and the shareholders are usually referred to as the stockholders. So when some people use the term 'stocks' they could be referring to either bonds or shares.

## Preference shares

Preference shares usually offer their owners a fixed rate of dividend each year. However, if the firm has insufficient profits the amount paid may be reduced, sometimes to zero. Thus, there is no guarantee that an annual income will be received, unlike with debt capital. The dividend on preference shares is paid before anything is paid out to ordinary shareholders – indeed, after the preference dividend obligation has been met there may be nothing left for ordinary shareholders. Preference shares are attractive to some investors because they offer a regular income at a higher rate of return than that available on fixed-interest securities, e.g. bonds. However, this higher return also comes with higher risk, as the preference dividend ranks after bond interest and upon liquidation preference holders are further back in the queue as recipients of the proceeds of asset sell-offs.

Preference shares are part of shareholders' funds but are not equity share capital. The holders are not usually able to benefit from any extraordinarily good performance of the firm - any profits above expectations go to the ordinary shareholders. Also preference shares usually carry no voting rights, except if the dividend is in arrears or in the case of liquidation. Many preference share prices and other data are listed in the financial pages of newspapers.

## Advantages to the firm of preference share capital
- Dividend 'optional' Preference dividends can be omitted for one or more years, giving directors more flexibility and a greater chance of surviving a downturn in trading.
- Influence over management Preference shares are an additional source of capital which, because they do not have voting rights, do not dilute the influence of the ordinary shareholders. Thus it is possible to raise shareholder capital and retain voting control.
- Extraordinary profits Preference shareholders receive a set return and do not share in extraordinary profits (unless the preference shares are 'participating' - see below).
- Financial gearing considerations There are limits to safe levels of borrowing. If a firm is unable to raise finance by borrowing, preference shares are an alternative source of financing, if shareholders are unwilling to provide more equity risk capital. They can be an alternative, though less effective, shock-absorber to selling more ordinary shares.

## Disadvantages to the firm of preference share capital
- High cost of capital The higher risk attached to the annual returns and capital cause preference shareholders to demand a higher level of return than debt holders.
- Dividends are not tax deductible Tax is payable on the firm's profit before the deduction of the preference dividend (as it is for ordinary share dividends). In contrast, interest has to be paid whether or not a profit is made. This cost is regarded as a legitimate expense reducing taxable profit – see Exhibit 8.2. Both firms have raised £1m, but Company A sold bonds yielding 8 per cent, Company B sold preference shares offering a dividend yield of 8 per cent.

## Types of preference shares

There are a number of variations on the theme of preference shares. Here are some additional features:

- Cumulative If dividends are missed in any year the right to receive a dividend is carried forward. These prior-year dividends have to be paid before any payout to ordinary shareholders.
- Participating As well as the fixed payment, the dividend may be increased if the company has high profits. (Usually the additional payment is a proportion of any ordinary dividend declared.)
- Redeemable These have a finite life, at the end of which the initial capital investment will be repaid.

## Exhibit 8.2 The effect of the tax deductibility of interest and the non-tax deductibility of preference share dividends

<table><tr><td></td><td>Company A
Raised £1m by selling bonds yielding 8\%</td><td>Company B
Raised £1m by issuing preference shares with 8\% yield</td></tr><tr><td>Profits before tax, dividends and interest</td><td>200,000</td><td>200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Interest payable on bonds</td><td>(80,000)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Taxable profit</td><td>120,000</td><td>200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Tax payable @ 30\% of taxable profit</td><td>(36,000)</td><td>(60,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Profit after tax</td><td>84,000</td><td>140,000</td></tr><tr><td>Preference dividend</td><td>(0)</td><td>(80,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Available for ordinary shareholders</td><td>84,000</td><td>60,000</td></tr></table>

Company A has a lower tax bill because its bond interest is used to reduce taxable profit, resulting in an extra £24,000 (£84,000-£60,000) available for ordinary shareholders.

- Irredeemables These have no fixed redemption date.
- Convertibles These can be converted at the holder's request into ordinary shares at specific dates and on pre-set terms (for example, one ordinary share for every two preference shares). These shares often carry a lower dividend yield since there is the attraction of a potentially large capital gain.
- Variable rate A variable dividend is paid. The rate may be linked to general interest rates, e.g. LIBOR, or to some other variable factor.

## Some unusual types of shares

In addition to ordinary shares and preference shares there are other, more unusual, types of shares.

Non-voting shares or reduced voting shares are sometimes issued by family-controlled firms which need additional equity finance but wish to avoid the diluting effects of an ordinary share issue. These shares are often called 'A' shares or 'B' shares (or N/V) and usually get the same dividends and the same share of assets in a liquidation as voting shares. The issue of non-voting or reduced voting shares is contentious, with many in the financial markets saying that everyone who puts equity into a company should have a vote on how that money is spent: the 'one share one vote' principle. However, investors can buy 'non-voters' for less than 'voters' and thereby gain a higher dividend yield. Also, without the possibility of issuing non-voting shares, many companies would simply prefer to forgo expansion. Around one-third of Europe's largest businesses fail to observe the 'one share one vote' principle. In the US the Ford family owns a mere 3.75 per cent of the shares. However, when the motor company joined the NYSE in 1956 the family's shares were converted into a special class that guaranteed 40 per cent of the voting power, no matter how many ordinary shares are in issue. When Google floated in 2004 Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders, held 'B' shares each with ten times as many votes per share as the 'A' shares issued to other investors. In the UK, there are relatively few companies with reduced voting rights compared with continental Europe. Dual-class is a US share (stock) issue where the shares issued have different degrees of voting rights. Exhibit 8.3 discusses Facebook's dual-class stock issue.

Deferred ordinary shares rank lower than ordinary shares for an agreed rate of dividend, so in a poor year the ordinary holders might get their payment while deferred ordinary holders receive nothing.

By David Gelles and Richard Waters in San Francisco

Facebook has followed Google's lead and introduced a dual-class stock structure, the clearest sign yet that the world's most popular social networking site is preparing for an eventual public offering.

In doing so, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's 25-year-old chief executive, looks to be cementing his long-term grip on the site he founded.

Dual-class stock structures are controversial because they give certain shareholders much stronger voting rights than others.

"Dual-class stock is an anathema to institutional investors," said Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.

"Ultimately, shareholders lose. If something were to go wrong, there's absolutely nothing they can do about it."

The use of separate classes of shares to protect the voting control of a narrow group of investors has traditionally been used in the US only in the media business.

Facebook confirmed the plan in a statement, saying that "existing shareholders wanted to maintain control over voting on certain issues to help ensure the company can continue to focus on the long-term to build a great business."

Mr Zuckerberg said that he plans to take the company public eventually. But yesterday Facebook said an IPO was not imminent.

Golden shares are shares with extraordinary special powers, for example the right to block a takeover or to restrict the influence of minority shareholders. Governments hold golden shares in some of the biggest companies in the UK and Europe (Royal Mail Group, Rolls-Royce, National Air Traffic Control, BAE Systems, BAA and Eurostar in the UK, VW and Portugal Teleco). However, European law states that golden shares are contrary to the EU principle of the free movement of capital and as such are illegal – see Exhibit 8.4. Their numbers have dwindled.

# Lisbon employs 'golden shares' to block Telefonica's bid for Vivo

By Peter Wise in Lisbon, Andrew Parker in New York and Mark Mulligan in Madrid

Lisbon has used special veto rights to override shareholders and block Telefonica's €7.15bn (£5.8bn) bid to buy Portugal Telecom out of Vivo, their Brazilian mobile phone joint venture.

The use by the Portuguese government of its "golden shares" to overrule 74 per cent of shareholders who voted in favour of the offer was a surprise new twist to the acrimonious bid battle between the two Iberian operators. The government owns 500 golden shares in Portugal Telecom, which give the state special veto rights over important company decisions.

But the intervention is expected to be challenged by the European Commission and by Telefonica, which had raised its bid by 10 per cent to €7.15bn hours before Portugal Telecom shareholders met to vote on it.

According to shareholders attending the closed meeting, members of the Portugal Telecom board had asked the government not to interfere. The board called an emergency meeting yesterday.

Shareholders including Banco Espírito Santo and Ongoing rejected Telefonica's previous bids of €5.17bn and €6.5bn but voted in favour of the new offer.

However, José Sócrates, Portugal's centre-left prime minister, said Telefonica's offer did not reflect the value of Vivo to Portugal Telecom. The government was "acting in the interest of the country", he said.

The legality of the state's rights in the company is being challenged in the European Court of Justice, which is expected to issue a ruling on July 8 finding the golden shares structure invalid.

Zeinal Bava, Portugal Telecom's chief executive, had previously said the bid for Vivo was not a case where the golden shares could be used. But he said yesterday the decision of the chairman of the meeting to accept the use of the government veto took

precedence over "whatever the board may or may not think".

# Stock exchanges around the world

# What is a stock market?

Stock markets are places where governments and industries can raise long-term capital and investors can buy and sell various types of financial instruments. Stock exchanges grew in response to the demand for funds to finance investment and (especially in the early days) ventures in overseas trade. Until the Napoleonic Wars the Dutch capital markets were pre-eminent, raising funds for investment abroad and loans for governments and businesses, and developing a thriving secondary market in which investors could sell their financial securities to other investors. This transferability of ownership of financial assets was an important breakthrough for the development of sophisticated financial systems. It offered the investor liquidity, which encouraged the flow of funds to firms, while leaving the capital in the business venture untouched.

Much early industrialisation was financed by individuals or partnerships, but as the capital requirements became larger it was clear that joint-stock enterprises were needed, in which the money of numerous investors was brought together to give joint ownership with the promise of a share of profits. Canal corporations, docks companies, manufacturing enterprises, railways, mining, brewing and insurance companies were added to the list of firms with shares and bonds traded on the stock exchanges of Europe, the US and a few places in Asia in the nineteenth century.

# Growth of stock markets

Since the nineteenth century stock markets have prospered and expanded globally. New markets have appeared in developing countries, to join and rival the traditional stock markets. Exhibit 8.5 details the relative size of stock markets around the world according to the total market capitalisation (number of shares multiplied by share price) of the companies traded on them.

The world has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. Liberalisation and the accelerating wave of privatisation pushed stock markets to the forefront of developing countries' tools of economic progress. The strong ideological opposition to capitalism has been replaced with stock markets in Moscow, Warsaw and Sofia. Even countries which still espouse communism, such as China and Vietnam, now have thriving and increasingly influential stock exchanges designed to facilitate the mobilisation of capital and its employment in productive endeavour, with - horror of horrors to some hard-line communists - a return going to the capital providers.

China has two thriving stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with over 2,000 companies listed. There are now tens of millions of Chinese investors who can only be properly described as 'capitalists' given that they put at risk their savings on the expectations of a reward on their capital. Exhibit 8.6 describes the rivalry between China's two main markets.

For years, Shanghai has been the undisputed king of China's equity markets, vitalised by a steady stream of initial public offerings from the country's biggest and best state-owned enterprises.

But this year Shanghai has been outgunned by Shenzhen, its less glamorous rival in the south of China, due to an extraordinary boom there in IPOs by smaller, private companies.

The Shenzhen Stock Exchange has seen 246 companies raise a record  \$33.6bn by new listings this year, triple last year's total and much more than the\$ 24.1bn raised in Shanghai.

Most of the companies listing in Shenhzen are small and medium-sized groups owned by private entrepreneurs, as opposed to the state-owned behemoths that typically gravitate to Shanghai.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which controls stock market listings in the country, appears to have sharply accelerated approvals of IPOs in Shenzhen this year. Market participants say the CSRC has also become less involved in decisions about size, timing, and pricing of share sales.

Shenzhen's IPO boom represents a substantial fresh source of capital for smaller private companies, which have typically been starved of funds by a state-owned banking system that has preferred to lend to other organs of the government.

The bourse is also an increasingly attractive place for private equity groups to make lucrative exits from their investments in China.

Goldman Sachs made a near 200-fold profit on the bank's original  $5\mathrm{m}$  investment in Heparlink, a pharmaceutical company, when the drugmaker listed in Shenzhen in April.

Chinese investors, who are restricted from investing abroad, remain hungry for fast-growing domestic companies - even as valuations double the average found in foreign markets.

"What is certainly out there in abundance - and what's desperate for capital - is the private and quasi-private sector," says Mr Howie. "Their time has come."

# Importance of stock exchanges

Today the important contribution of stock exchanges to economic well-being is recognised from Uzbekistan to Uruguay. There are now more than 100 countries with exchanges and many of these countries have more than one exchange. Many exchanges have been amalgamated with larger ones: the London Stock Exchange merged with the Borsa Italiana in 2007; the NYSE merged in 2006 with the Euronext group, itself a merger of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon exchanges, in 2008 with the American Stock Exchange, and in 2011 it was attempting to merge with the Deutsche Börse; the US market NASDAQ merged in 2007 with OMX, the Scandinavian and Baltic group of exchanges (Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen and Iceland, and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Armenia) and also with the Boston and Philadelphia exchanges, with the result that NASDAQ OMX is the largest US electronic exchange, listing over 2,800 companies in the US and another 800 in Europe. In addition to actual mergers, many stock exchanges have holdings in other exchanges or have mutual trading agreements. For instance, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has a 4.9 per cent shareholding in the Singapore exchange.

Exhibit 8.7 focuses on the share trading aspect of 20 of these markets, but most markets usually also trade bonds and other securities. Note the size and importance now of markets outside Europe and North America.

# A comparison of the major markets

Until quite recently the LSE was the leading stock exchange in the world for trading shares in overseas companies and one of the biggest for the trading of domestic company shares. However, the electronic revolution and mergers have dramatically increased the market in foreign equity trading in the US, and NYSE Euronext and NASDAQ OMX now head the field in both foreign and domestic trading (see Exhibits 8.8 and 8.9). Looking only at domestic (home-grown companies') equity, China's domestic trading has shown a huge increase as it opens itself to capitalism.

More mergers and alliances between exchanges are bound to follow, not least because the major financial institutions that operate across the globe desire a seamless, less costly way of trading shares over borders. The ultimate ambition for some visionaries is a single highly liquid equity market allowing investors to trade and companies to raise capital, wherever it suits them, or at least to do so within a continent such as Europe. Ideally, there would be no distortions in share price, costs of trading or regulation as investors cross from one country to another. Whether it is necessary to merge all together Europe's disparate stock exchanges to achieve frictionless pan-European trading is a matter that is hotly debated. Some argue that the absence of a single securities market damages the EU's competitive position vis-à-vis the huge, streamlined and

# The importance of a well-run stock exchange

A well-run stock exchange has a number of characteristics. It is one where a 'fair game' takes place; that is, where it is not possible for some investors and fund raisers to benefit at the expense of other participants – all players are on a level playing field. It is a market which is well regulated to avoid abuses, negligence and fraud in order to reassure investors who put their savings at risk. It is also one in which it is reasonably cheap to carry out transactions. In addition, a large number of buyers and sellers are likely to be needed for the efficient price setting of shares and to

# 1 Firms can find funds and grow

Because investors in financial securities with a stock market quotation are assured that they are, generally, able to sell their shares quickly, cheaply and with a reasonable degree of certainty about the price, they are willing to supply funds to firms at a lower cost than they would if selling was slow, or expensive, or the sale price was subject to much uncertainty. Thus stock markets encourage investment by mobilising savings. As well as stimulating the investment of domestic savings, stock markets can be useful for attracting foreign savings and for aiding the privatisation process.

# 2 Allocation of capital

One of the key economic problems for a nation is finding a mechanism for deciding what mixture of goods and services to produce. An extreme solution has been tried and shown to be lacking in sophistication – that of a totalitarian directed economy where bureaucratic diktat determines the exact quantity of each line of commodity produced. The alternative method favoured in most nations (for the majority of goods and services) is to let the market decide what will be produced and which firms will produce it.

An efficiently functioning stock market is able to assist this process through the flow of investment capital. If the stock market was poorly regulated and operated then the mispricing of shares and other financial securities could lead to society's scarce capital resources being put into sectors which are inappropriate given the objective of maximising economic well-being. If, for instance, the market priced the shares of a badly managed company in a declining industrial sector at a high level then that firm would find it relatively easy to sell shares and raise funds for further investment in its business or to take over other firms. This would deprive companies with better prospects and with a greater potential contribution to make to society of essential finance.

To take an extreme example: imagine the year is 1910 and on the stock market are some firms which manufacture horse-drawn carriages. There are also one or two young companies which have taken up the risky challenge of producing motor cars. Analysts will examine the prospects of the two types of enterprise before deciding which firms will get a warm reception when they ask for more capital in a sale of shares. The unfavoured firms will find their share prices falling as investors sell their shares and will be unable to attract more savers' money. One way for the older firm to stay in business would be to shift resources within the firm to the production of those commodities for which consumer demand is on a rising trend.

More recently there has been a dramatic shift in finance resources as markets supplied hundreds of billions to high-technology industries, such as mobile phone chip technology, e.g. the Cambridge-based company ARM plc, which designs and licenses 95 per cent of the world's chips for mobiles, or Skype in internet telephony.

# 3 For shareholders

Shareholders benefit from the availability of a speedy, cheap secondary market if they want to sell. Not only do shareholders like to know that they can sell shares when they want to, they may simply want to know the value of their holdings even if they have no intention of selling at present. By contrast, an unquoted firm's shareholders often find it very difficult to assess the value of their holding.

Founders of firms may be particularly keen to obtain a quotation for their firms. This will enable them to diversify their assets by selling a proportion of their holdings. Also, venture capital firms which fund unquoted firms during their rapid growth phase often press the management to aim for a quotation to permit the venture capitalist to have the option of realising the gains made on the original investment, or simply to boost the value of their holding by making it more liquid.

# 4 Status and publicity

The public profile of a firm can be enhanced by being quoted on an exchange. Banks and other financial institutions generally have more confidence in a quoted firm and therefore are more likely to provide funds at a lower cost. Their confidence is raised because the company's activities are now subject to detailed scrutiny. The publicity surrounding the process of gaining a quotation may have a positive impact on the image of the firm in the eyes of customers, suppliers and employees and so may lead to a beneficial effect on their day-to-day business.

# 5 Mergers

Mergers can be facilitated better by a quotation. This is especially true if the payments offered to the target firm's shareholders for their holdings are shares in the acquiring firm. A quoted share has a value defined by the market, whereas shares in unquoted firms are difficult to assess.

The stock exchange also assists what is called 'the market in managerial control'. This is a mechanism in which teams of managers are seen as competing for control of corporate assets. Or, to put it more simply, mergers through the stock market permit the displacement of inefficient management with a more successful team. Thus, according to this line of reasoning, assets will be used more productively and society will be better off. This market in managerial control is not as effective as is sometimes claimed (it tends to be over-emphasised by acquiring managers).

# 6 Improves corporate behaviour

If a firm's shares are traded on an exchange, the directors may be encouraged to behave in a manner conducive to shareholders' interests. This is achieved through a number of pressure points. For example, to obtain a quotation on a reputable exchange, companies are required to disclose a far greater range and depth of information than is required by accounting standards or the Companies Act. This information is then disseminated widely and can become the focus of much public and press comment. Before a company is admitted to an exchange the authorities insist on being assured that the management team are sufficiently competent and, if necessary, additional directors are appointed to supplement the board's range of knowledge and skills. Investment analysts also ask for regular briefings from senior managers and continuously monitor the performance of firms. For a quoted company, directors are required to consult shareholders on important decisions, such as mergers. They also have to be very careful to release price-sensitive information in a timely and orderly fashion and they are strictly forbidden to use inside information to make a profit by buying or selling the firm's shares.

# Tasks for stock exchanges

Traditionally, exchanges perform the following tasks in order to play their valuable role in a modern society:

- supervision of trading to ensure fairness and efficiency; the authorisation of market participants such as brokers and market makers;
- creation of an environment in which prices are formed efficiently and without distortion (price discovery or price formation). This requires not only regulation of a high order and low transaction costs but also a liquid market in which there are many buyers and sellers, permitting investors to enter or exit quickly without moving the price;
- organisation of the settlement of transactions (after the deal has been struck the buyer must pay for the shares and the shares must be transferred to the new owners); the regulation of the admission of companies to the exchange and the regulation of companies on the exchange;
- the dissemination of information, e.g. trading data, prices and company announcements. Investors are more willing to trade if prompt and complete information about trades, companies and prices is available.

In recent years the need for stock exchanges to carry out all these activities has been called into question. If we take the case of the LSE, the settlement of transactions was long ago handed over to CREST (discussed later in this chapter). Also the responsibility for authorising the listing of companies was transferred to the UK Listing Authority arm of the Financial Services Authority (the principal UK regulator). The LSE's Regulatory News Service (which distributes important company announcements and other price-sensitive news) has to compete with other distribution platforms outside the LSE's control as listed companies are now able to choose between competing providers of news dissemination platforms (there are currently eight regulatory information services).

# New trading systems

# Multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)

Traditional stock exchanges had virtual monopoly positions for the trading of shares and other securities in their home countries. They had little incentive to cut fees or to improve their trading technology. This resulted in the main users, institutional investment funds, banks, brokers and hedge funds, becoming frustrated with the raw deal they were getting.

Starting in the US in the early 2000s they determined that the national stock exchanges could do with some competition, so they got together, chipped in a few million for start-up costs and created new trading platforms. These were equipped with nimbler technology and required far fewer staff than the traditional exchanges. They had narrower differences between the price to buy (bid) and the price to sell (offer) a share, lower execution (transaction) costs and the time between sending an order and the order being complete was much faster than the traditional exchanges. Not only did the institutions now have a cheaper way of trading shares but they could also use the presence of the new trading platforms to force the old exchanges to change their ways.

The Americans called these platforms electronic communications networks (ECNs). They are also known as multilateral trading facilities (a term more favoured in Europe) and they have certainly had an effect. As recently as 2003 about 80 per cent of the trading volume in the shares listed on the NYSE was handled by the NYSE itself. Today, less than one-quarter of the trades go through the NYSE; the rest are traded through a number of MTFs including BATS, Direct Edge and ArcaEx (and 'dark pools' - see later). NYSE is not alone; NASDAQ has lost a lot of trade to the new venues as well.

A major breakthrough in Europe occurred in November 2007, with the introduction of the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), which aims to provide a 'harmonised regulatory regime for investment services across the 30 member states of the European Economic Area. The main objectives of the Directive are to increase competition and consumer protection in investment services'. Following this Directive, brokers acting on behalf of share (and other security) buyers and sellers must now demonstrate that they are achieving the keenest price and using the most efficient, cost-effective trading venues. This encouraged the establishment of cheaper and faster electronic trading platforms to challenge the old ones. And, of course, European institutional investors were just as keen as their US counterparts to have alternatives to the national exchanges.

These traditional stock markets have lost a lot of trade to the new generation of European MTFs (such as BATS Europe, Chi-X and Turquoise). These trade the shares from companies quoted on a variety of national exchanges across Europe, and they are far less strictly regulated than stock markets. As recently as 2007 shares in the FTSE100 index were traded largely through the LSE. Today there are 20 alternative trading platforms, five of which are MTFs (the others are 'dark pools'). MTFs have taken around one-third of continental European share trading and about half of trading in large UK companies' shares, causing a drop in volume of trading at the LSE and other traditional stock exchanges. Japan has joined the movement. It now has five new competing trading venues outside the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), but they are not (yet) taking much market share as the TSE's fees are not considered expensive and it offers a fast trading service.

BATS, one of the largest MTFs, was founded in 2005 as an e-trading exchange and quickly took a sizeable share of the US equity trading market. It has now has expanded into Europe and has further expansion plans. It already turns over more shares than either Euronext (Europe) or Deutsche Börse – see Exhibit 8.10.

# Jeremy Grant

Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Chi-X Europe, has a habit when he is speaking at industry conferences of describing his business as "an exchange".

Technically, he is wrong. Chi-X was launched in 2007 as a "multilateral trading facility" (MTF) - regulatory jargon for a type of share trading platform that emerged in the wake of the enactment by Brussels of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).

"According to the Oxford dictionary and Websters that's what we are," Mr Haynes insists. "We're a meeting place of buyers and sellers." But in one important way

Chi-X deserves to be ranked alongside the likes of bourses such as the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse. After only three years in existence, it handles more share trading than the German bourse, and more than the LSE's UK markets division.

Small wonder that Chi-X has now started to attract interest from potential buyers. An as-yet unnamed party wrote to Mr Haynes last weekend expressing interest in the business.

Speculation is centred on Nasdaq OMX and Deutsche Börse, which both lack a substantial pan-European presence. But another name on observers' lips is Chi-X's main rival: BATS Global Markets, parent of BATS Europe.

Like Chi-X, BATS Europe was set up as an MTF to take advantage of Mifid, which broke the national monopolies of Europe's established exchanges and allowed upstart platforms such as Chi-X to emerge.

Most were backed by banks and brokers that were the biggest providers of orders to the exchanges.

Now, however, the economics of running an MTF are tougher than in 2007, before the financial crisis. Volumes in Europe are anaemic, meaning it will be harder for them

European share trading volumes

*Ceased trading July 2010

## Exhibit 8.10 continued to reach profitability (although Mr Haynes says Chi-X has been operationally profitable in the seven consecutive months up to July).

Step one in consolidation of the MTF's took place this year when the LSE bought Turquoise, another bank-backed venture that launched after Chi-X.

Some suggest the next step might involve the shareholders of BATS and Chi-X coming to an arrangement. After all, they share five of the same shareholders: Getco, the Chicago-based market-making firm: Citi; Credit Suisse; Bank of America/Merrill Lynch; and Morgan Stanley.

With volumes low, it is questionable whether all shareholders would want to stay committed to two platforms with the ongoing investment in technology and post-trade arrangements that this involves.

The proliferation of trading venues means that prices are increasingly being set for shares in a number of different places. In 2007, Rolls-Royce's shares were publicly traded in one place; now it is bought and sold on 14 platforms. This raises the difficulty of maintaining the quality of high transparency in trades required to promote trust in the market process. While the prices on the different platforms track one another, only those traders with very sophisticated systems for seeing the trades going through each of the 14 venues can know what is going on and whether there are opportunities to buy or sell quickly when discrepancies in prices make it worthwhile. This benefits linked-up traders who can act fast, but this is at the expense of ordinary investors. The splitting of trading between so many platforms has also led to concern that the important quality of liquidity is being lost. In response the EU and country regulators have listened to the voices calling for a 'consolidated tape' which would list all the bid and offer prices from all venues, throughout Europe at least - see Exhibit 8.11.

## Exhibit 8.11

## Europe set for overhaul of rules on share dealing

FT

Jeremy Grant and Nikki Tait

For the past three years in Europe, traders have watched as the share dealing landscape has changed beyond recognition.

Thanks to reforms passed by the European Commission, competitors have emerged for national exchanges, while new rivals have proliferated, creating a spaghetti junction of trading venues, spewing out market data and prices.

Yesterday, however, regulators fired their first salvo in attempting to bring more order to the markets.

The Committee of European Securities Regulators kicked off the biggest overhaul of the region's securities regulations in years, calling for a wide range of reforms to bolster transparency of Europe's increasingly fragmented equities and over-the-counter derivatives markets.

Among its top recommendations was a call for the establishment of a central point where prices for shares traded across multiple venues can easily be seen - a so-called "consolidated tape".

Europe's share markets were revolutionised in 2007 with the passage by Brussels of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).

That kicked off competition between exchanges and allowed the emergence of competing venues.

While the proliferation of trading venues has brought down transaction costs, an unintended consequence is that there is no publicly-available central system for gathering such post-trade data, as there is in industries like insurance, where consumers can check price comparison websites.

Three years ago, shares in the FTSE 100 were largely traded on the London Stock Exchange. Now they are available on 21 venues, including the LSE, a rival platform called Chi-X, and off-exchange venues known as "dark pools", where large orders are matched in private.

"Fragmentation of transparency information, if not addressed properly, raises concerns because it could undermine the overarching transparency objective in Mifid, and may

## Recommendations by the Committee of European Securities Regulators

### Market data

Create a single point of access to post-trade market data, in a so-called 'consolidated tape.' Regulators to impose a publicly-run solution if that does not happen within about two years

Force down the cost of post-trade data by insisting that exchanges and other venues make available preand post-trade data separately. Currently they are bundled together, meaning data in Europe can cost up to 10 times more than in the US

### Trading venues

Upstart trading venues – known as 'multilateral trading facilities' – that have been competing with national exchanges to be brought in line with the way established exchanges are regulated

Banks that operate trade matching facilities known as 'crossing networks', where large orders are done out of the public eye, to be required to publish the number, value and volume of transactions

### Trading behaviour

Electronic messages used by traders to convey information to certain market participants about buying and selling interest in a share – known as 'indications of interest, or 'IOIs' – to be treated as normal orders and made public to the whole market

On 'high-frequency' trading, where rapid-fire computer algorithms can make thousands of trades in seconds, CESR did not recommend any action, saying "further work" was needed result in less transparent markets," CESR said in its report yesterday.

It did not limit its recommendations to equities. The Paris-based body, which coordinates activities of EU securities regulators, recommended ways to bring transparency to derivatives data and called for the same reporting rules applying to equities to also apply to exchange-traded funds.

It also suggested new rules to tighten up on dark pools operated by banks and advocated clamping down on sending electronic messages into the market to test buying and selling interest.

Yet there is urgency to address issues such as lack of transparency in market data.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are already concerned that the unfettered growth of competition is damaging investor trust in market structures.

The MTFs themselves have responded to the need for their customers to have access to a number of trading venues at the same time. They have introduced 'smart order routing' that directs a trade to the platform that offers the best price, even if that is not on their facility - see Exhibit 8.12.

Serious concerns have been raised about the lower level of regulation on MTFs. Regulators require the main national markets to employ a team of people to survey trades every day to ensure that the market is not being abused. MTFs are not required to do this. Xavier Rolet, CEO of the LSE at the time of writing, and other traditional stock exchange chiefs have complained of an 'uneven playing field' because they have to bear the costly regulatory burden (according to Mr Rolet, the LSE has 150 regulatory staff compared with Chi-X's five and it pays about €5 million p.a. in regulatory fees compared with Chi-X's £125,000). Exhibit 8.13 describes the dangers of fragmentation.

## BATS in 'smart order' move

By Jeremy Grant in London

BATS Europe, one of five share dealing venues battling Europe's established bourses, is set to offer traders a new service that seeks out where their orders are most likely to find a match on both the region's multiple "dark pools" or standard trading platforms.

The move makes US-based BATS, the second of the region's small trading venues to offer such a "smart order routing" service after Nasdaq OMX Europe, a rival platform owned by Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange.

Smart order routing is a service commonly offered by brokers and banks as a way of encouraging investors to place more orders with them.

Smart order routing has grown in popularity in Europe as the number of trading venues has proliferated in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which broke exchanges' monopolies in 2007.

It uses technology that scans multiple pools of liquidity, identifying where the best price for a particular share is likely to be found. It also helps ascertain where large orders can easily be done, and can split orders into smaller sizes and seek the best venues for them to be matched, often within a matter of seconds.

The BATS move shows that the lines are blurring between the role of brokers in seeking out the best deals for investors and exchanges and trading platforms, traditionally only recipients of orders from brokers. It also shows that the platforms to which orders are routed by such technology are themselves offering the same service as a way to attract more orders.

That is because complete orders - made up of thousands of shares - are often not filled completely at any given venue. Any exchange or trading platform that is able to find matches for any unfilled orders by "order routing" them away to other venues - even rival ones - are seen as offering a valuable service.

Like Nasdaq OMX Europe, BATS Europe will charge a fee for its smart order routing service.

## Multiple venues leave Europe 'open to abuse'

"Layering", "spoofing" and "painting the tape" are just some of the underhand practices that crop up from time to time in equity markets.

But regulators could soon be using these terms much more frequently in the wake of fresh warnings about the potential for market abuse in Europe.

A group of consulting groups in Britain has published a study showing that the fragmentation of trading venues as a result of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) has left Europe open to abuse by traders wanting to manipulate the markets.

They contend that the fragmentation of trading across multiple venues - exchanges, newer platforms and dark pools - means that regula tors cannot spot fraud as easily - and may be missing it completely.

That will come as unwelcome news to the architects of Mifid in Brussels who devised it as a way of spurring competition, allowing the emergence of "multilateral trading facilities" and lowering trading costs for investors.

It is also likely to fuel a row between exchanges and their smaller rivals over who is better at keeping tabs on market abuse.

The consulting groups behind the Alliance of Independent Advisors to Financial Markets, or Avenues, argue that the function of ensuring markets are fair - such as the surveillance of bids and offers and executed trades - is "now almost impossible to undertake comprehensively".

It says the potential for abuse has been heightened by the fact that a Market Abuse Directive passed by the European Commission came into force two years before Mifid in 2007, when no MTFs existed and when most trading was done on national exchanges.

Yet with the advent of Mifid, as much as half of trading in some big name stocks takes place away from exchanges, so surveillance staff only see a fraction of activity in many stocks. Last month, the London Stock Exchange's share of trading in FTSE 100 stocks dipped below 50 per cent for the first time.

"No single exchange now sees all the activity on any given stock for which they are responsible. MTFs do not invest in comparable surveillance infrastructures and internal broker-dealer 'crossing networks' [dark pools] are in effect unregulated in Market Abuse Directive terms," Avenues says.

Similar concerns have been raised in the US, where equity markets are fragmented between the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and smaller platforms such as BATS and Direct Edge.

Rick Ketchum, chief executive of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which regulates US brokerage firms, recently acknowledged that "the decline of the primary market concept, where there was a single price discovery market whose on-site regulator saw 90-plus percent of the trading activity, has obviously become a reality".

Mats Wilhelmsson, chief operating officer at Scila, a Swedish seller of market surveillance systems - and a former head of surveillance at the Swedish markets regulator - agrees with Avenues' conclusions. He says that "some types of market manipulation are much easier to execute in the post-Mifid environment because of [market] fragmentation".

He singles out "front-running", where a broker, knowing a client has a large buy or sell order, will carry out a buy or sell order of its own first, to take advantage of the price movement that the broker knows the client order is likely to have once it is placed in the market.

Joost van der Does de Willebois, chairman of Euronext Amsterdam, the Dutch segment of NYSE Euronext, says Euronext has long been required by regulators to maintain a "market integrity unit" of surveillance staff to monitor markets - not a requirement for MTFs. "We would argue that Mifid has created an unlevel playing field for which we have good evidence. It all

Brian Taylor, managing director of BTA Consulting, a member of Avenues, argues that industry and regulators should come together to create a "utility" to carry out surveillance across Europe, involving all venues and not just exchanges.

Regulators in Brussels are set to review the market abuse directive later this year. Maria Velentza, head of the securities markets unit in the European Commission's directorate-general for the internal market and services, which is reviewing Mifid, says Brussels will study the issue.

The main idea of introducing Mifid was to lower the cost of trading equities. But many professional asset managers are frustrated by the unintended consequences. While the cost of using platforms themselves has fallen between 20 per cent and 80 per cent (the old exchanges have lowered their charges significantly), there have been increases in complexity and in technology needed to access the new venues. Individual investors, too, are not terribly impressed with the changes that have taken place – see Exhibit 8.14.

# Private investors fail to see benefits of Mifid reform

Jeremy Grant and James Wilson

Among hundreds of investors who flocked to a fair in Frankfurt last week - listening to pitches for opportunities from exchange-traded funds to Canadian gold mines - it was difficult to find anyone who believed that the "Mifid" [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive] had helped them.

Mifid was enacted by the European Commission in 2007. It was designed to cut the cost of dealing in company shares across Europe, heralding an era where private, or "retail" investors, would place more of their savings into traded financial instruments, relieving the burden of pension provision on stricken European government budgets.

But for retail investors at the German fair such as Kirsten Meyer-Witting, a consultant who trades shares for herself, the supposed benefits of Mifid have yet to materialise. She says: "Things have got cheaper but not necessary because of Mifid. I would not be able to say what difference it has made."

An association representing more than 29 investor groups across Europe goes further. Guillaume Prache, managing director of the European Federation of Investors (EFI), says brokerage fees have come down for large institutions trading shares, such as banks but not for retail investors.

He says brokers serving retail investors often fail to show prices across all the available venues, usually only showing prices on the national exchange - as before Mifid.

Partly that is a problem of education: many retail brokers simply are not aware of the range of trading venues in a post-Mifid world. Niki Beattie, managing director of The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy, says: "I don't think the individual investor has benefitted from Mifid. Regulators and the Commission need to do a better job of educating investors."

In addition, many small and medium-sized brokers cannot afford to build the data feed connections so that prices can be shown widely. Mr Prache says: "If you go to your broker screen you often get only the regulated [exchange] market info mation for any given share. That's obviously one failure of Mifid."

Markus Kienle, a representative of the SdK, an organisation representing small investors, says: "When you look at the results of the advice people are getting you would get the impression that Mifid has not brought very much.

"Organisational models don't help to improve the quality of advice. I think transparency is as bad as it was before." However, Marco Tungler, managing director of the DSW, a big association representing German private investors, argues that Mifid has benefited retail investors, including helping them see fees set by bank brokers laid out more explicitly than before. "It has taken people a couple of years to get used to it but there is pressure on price now and customers are more ready to negotiate with their bank. They are more independent," he says.

# Trading speed

Nowadays most share dealing is done using linked computer systems in trading rooms set miles apart rather than telephone or face-to-face deals. Computer programs source the best buying and selling prices and execute the deals virtually instantaneously. Also, traders can link up to the markets without needing to ask a broker to execute a trade. Exhibit 8.15 shows some benefits of electronic (e-) trading.

Electronic trading has gone further as some investors demand very fast dealing times. This has led to the development of high-frequency trading (HFT), which usually uses computer programmed algorithms to buy or sell quickly. The blisteringly fast trading speed gives a millisecond advantage to the HF trader, enabling them to be the first to buy or sell shares, futures, options or other derivatives of shares. This is the key to the success of HFT: super-computers which can process massive volumes of information and make decisions based on that information. They respond when particular conditions occur, say, sell or buy when a certain share price hits a certain level, without the need for humans to punch in orders to keyboards. The drive for speed has led to traders placing their computer servers within exchanges' data centres so as to reduce the physical distance between systems – after all, a microsecond can make all the difference. The old exchanges have had to respond. For example, the LSE has installed what it describes as the quick-

This is the time taken from the moment when a client inputs an order to the exchange and a message comes back to the client that the deal is done.

HFT now accounts for more than half of all equity trading in the US and one-third in Europe, and is causing concern in some quarters about the behaviour of the traders, especially those who rely on computer programmed responses. There is a worry that markets are becoming a playground for a few specialist traders rather than places that help economic activity by, say, raising capital for businesses. There is also the well-justified fear that programs might all send the same 'sell' signal at the same time, causing a crash by automatically selling shares. Exhibit 8.16 discusses some of the worries.

# Exhibit 8.16

# 'Algo-trading' changes speed of the game on Wall Street

By Jeremy Grant in London

"Guys this is probably the craziest I've seen it down here ever!" That was the strangled cry of a trader in the futures trading pits of Chicago on Thursday afternoon when the stock market plunged a stomachchurning 9 per cent.

But the roller-coaster ride was not caused by traders shouting at each other. It was, instead, driven by computers. For today's stock markets are over-whelmingly governed by mathematical algorithms programmed to jump in and out of the markets almost at the speed of

FT

# Exhibit 8.16 continued light, in a frenzied search for trades that yield a quick profit.

To proponents of "algorithmic trading", this has made markets more efficient and opened up new opportunities. No longer are we so reliant on a wink and a nod in a trading pit. Rapid advances in technology have helped suck in new market participants, boosting the amount of liquidity for the investing public.

But "algo-trading", and the rise of so-called "high-frequency" traders that often use it, is so pervasive that some suspect it may be hard to see how ordinary investors can be expected to trust market structures in which they have placed their faith for decades. Instead, they seem to serve the interests of short-term traders using the latest computer wizardry.

More than half the US equity markets involve the use of a form of algorithmic or high-frequency trading. That is a huge increase since the 1987 stock market crash, where programme trades were blamed for exacerbating falls.

Moreover, trading takes place not only on the main exchanges - the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq - but on a plethora of other platforms, including "dark pools" and systems operated by brokers themselves. Less than 35 per cent of trading in NYSE-listed shares actually takes place on the New York Stock Exchange these days.

The speed of trades is mindboggling. Last month Algo Technologies, a US company, unveiled a system that can handle a trade in 16 microseconds.

Stock exchanges are courting "algo" traders, eager to attract business away from rival platforms. For most ordinary investors the idea of an exchange is still the neoclassical facade of the mighty NYSE on Wall Street.

But in reality, most shares change hands in vast data centres. One of them, the size of three football fields, opened for business this week in Basildon, UK, built by NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York exchange.

Yet amid the technological revolution, it is unclear whether exchanges and brokers have the risk management systems to guard against algos running wild, perhaps triggered by erroneous or "fat finger" trades.

Something else worries observers. The trader in Chicago shouting himself hoarse was quoting prices in S&P index futures, not ordinary shares, which often trade in a direct relationship with equities. That means a problem in the equity markets quickly becomes a problem elsewhere - raising the spectre of a systemic hit to the financial system.

As Wall Street digests the turmoil, the Securities and Exchange Commission is engaged in the most far-reaching study of how technology has changed the way markets work.

It wants to figure out whether ordinary investors have been put at a disadvantage by the technological revolution.

The trigger for the large market decline on 6 May 2010 (mentioned in Exhibit 8.16) was a trade put on by a conventional asset manager (using futures in a share market index), but the problem was greatly exaggerated by algorithmic-based HFT - see Exhibit 8.17 (a 'fat finger trade' is where a trader accidentally presses the wrong button on a computer keyboard and buys, say, 20 million shares instead of 2 million). The defenders of HFT counter the critics by saying that it benefits markets by providing liquidity and narrower bid-offer spreads because the HF traders arbitrage away price differences across multiple platforms.

# Flash crash: market reform to be examined

The high-frequency trading firms that have come to dominate daily trading in US equity markets may feel entitled to a little slack.

After suffering a good deal of political heat over May's "flash crash" on Wall Street, it turns out that a large order by a traditional investor was the trigger for the wild market swings.

A report by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission concluded on Friday that the May 6 sell-out was sparked by a rapidly executed 4.1bn sale of stock-index futures by a single institutional investor, who was hedging against the risk of a market downturn.

The order was placed via a computer-based order execution programme so quickly - in just 20 minutes - that it triggered wild automated selling by other traders, including the high-frequency traders (HFTs).

The decision to sell on "autopilot" into markets that were already jittery over concerns on possible European sovereign-debt default was unusual.

Regulators have not explained why the seller, identified by a person familiar with the matter as money manager Waddell & Reed, demanded that the trade be executed so quickly, especially as previous similar trades and been placed over a five-hour time frame. The sell order was for e-Mini S&P 500 futures.

"The report seems to conclude that the spark that got the whole thing started was a trade by a plain-vanilla asset manager, and that could take some of the pressure off the high-frequency trading community," says Justin Schack, director of market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities. The automation of trading has led to a surge in volumes driven by high-speed computer programmes. Around a dozen HFTs dominate volumes in equity markets - both cash shares and futures - on many days.

The rapid growth of such trading has led smaller investors to complain that they are at a disadvantage.

The fragmented structure of equity market, where trades are conducted across some 50 venues ranging from the New York Stock Exchange to "dark pools", had already attracted the attention of regulators.

Since the flash crash, political pressure to take action to curb the influence of the HFTs has increased, even though it was not clear whether such trading was the reason for the market swings.

The report, however, does show that there is a difference between the volume of shares changing hands, and the actual underlying demand - or liquidity - for shares. HFTs make razor-thin margins on each trade, and only make money if they do many of them.

"HFTs began to quickly buy and then resell contracts to each other - generating a "hot-potato" volume effect as the same positions were rapidly passed back and forth," says the flash crash report.

Over the course of just 14 seconds, the report says 27,000 contracts of e-Mini S&P 500 futures were traded, around half by HFTs. On a net basis, however, only 200 additional contracts were bought in those seconds.

One widely held assumption about the way markets operate is that the high levels of trading activity means liquidity - when large positions can be bought or sold without affecting the price significantly. The report's findings appear to undermine that.

"Just as there's a difference in tennis or ping pong between the rally before the point and the point itself, in markets, there's a difference between a position going back and forth between market makers and a position actually bought by a fundamental buyer who will hold it overnight," said Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC, on Monday.

Mr Gensler said that a committee will consider the report and make recommendations to both the CFTC and the SEC, in particular in three areas.

First, the committee should look more closely at how investors place orders. It should examine whether customers such as Waddell & Reed and the brokers executing orders for the customers should be subject to trading limits or have an obligation for orderly execution.

The second question would be whether there should be more visibility on the full extent of orders.

The third would be whether there should be further "market pauses" - such as the circuit breakers introduced by regulators after the flash crash that can give investors and traders time to rethink their strategies in periods of market turbulence.

The debate about the dominance of high-speed trading is unlikely to end soon. Lawmakers are waiting for the next moves from regulators - and the outcome of November's congressional elections - but aides say they believe legislation will be needed and that the current circuit breaker proposals are likely to be inadequate in preventing a future spiral of selling.

Paul Kanjorski, chairman of the House financial services sub-committee on capital markets, said after the report that regulators needed to review and revise equity market rules. "While automated, high-frequency trading may provide our markets with some benefits, it can also carry the potential for serious harm and market mischief," he said.

Patrick Armstrong, a New York Stock Exchange trader and head of the Alliance of Floor Brokers, an advocacy group, says that regulators are not "pointing the finger hard enough" at the HFT players in the market.

"The world is starting to wake up to the realities of speed versus price, and I just don't understand why we need to continue to get faster," he says.

# Dark pools

If you are an institutional trader and you want to sell a large block of shares in a company, you have a problem. With the main exchanges you are usually required to advertise up-front the number of shares you wish to sell together with a price you are willing to accept. So, if the usual size of trade in your chosen share is between 1,000 and 10,000 and you suddenly come along and offer 200,000 shares, your inputting of that information on the exchange's dealing system is going to have an effect on the market price. Other traders instantly become aware that you are trying to shift an extraordinarily large volume and will lower the prices at which they are willing to buy to take advantage of your need. Similarly, there is a problem when you wish to buy a large block of shares in a company – the market moves against you.

The main solution to this problem is for you to break down the order into much smaller pieces. With modern computers you can instruct the exchange's system to display an order to sell, say, 5,000, and then as soon as that has been sold the system automatically posts another order for, say 4,000, and then 6,000 when that has sold, and so on until you have sold the full 200,000. You have not spooked the market and have hopefully got decent prices. Because electronic trading, with its greater ability to split large orders, has largely replaced older methods (pit trading and market maker-based trading – see later in the chapter and in Chapter 3), the typical US order size of the 1990s has fallen from 1,400 shares or  \$40,000 to only 300 shares and\$ 6,000 on the NYSE or NASDAQ. In the UK, average order sizes have fallen 90 per cent to around £8,000 on the LSE, and similar falls occurred in other markets such as Deutsche Börse and Hong Kong.

The solution of splitting large orders on the regulated exchanges has helped but it does not work perfectly because experienced traders often recognise who is dealing and start to see a pattern emerging: they can see the displayed prices before the deal goes through, and they can see you adding orders regularly. To try to resolve this, since 2004 the large institutions, such as banks, have set up a number of new trading venues, called dark pools, where large orders can be placed anonymously without the need to advertise the price or size to the wider market before a trade is agreed. It is still a requirement that completed deals are announced to all market users, but this is not as immediate as on the regulated exchanges (although regulators are calling for a speeding up). There are distinct advantages in not forewarning the mass of traders that a large body of shares is seeking a new home or someone is looking to bulk-buy shares. Even when a trade is published, there is no way of ascertaining whether it was a full or part trade that was executed, nor any way for investors to know what buyers and sellers are still around.

The US has over 40 dark pools in operation, with about half that number in Europe. A typical large order in a dark pool can be as large as 55,000 shares. Dark pools have taken about 8-10 per cent of share trading in the US, about 5 per cent of those in Europe and a growing proportion in Asia.

The lit pools on the normal national exchanges, where prices, bid-offer spreads and offered sizes are visible to every member of the public, contribute to transparency and the price discovery process – see later in this chapter. The problem with the proliferation of trading venues and dispersed order flow is the fragmentation of trading in a company's shares resulting in poorer liquidity on any one platform. Market regulators are trying to improve matters – see Exhibit 8.18.

## Exhibit 8.18

## Call to make 'dark pools' trades public

FT

By Jeremy Grant in Amsterdam

Share trading that takes place in "dark pools" should be revealed to the public and regulators should "take steps to support the use" of "transparent" orders over "dark" trades, according to the global umbrella body for national securities watchdogs.

The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) on Wednesday published six "draft principles" to "address regulatory

"concerns" over dark pools, on which public consultation ends in January.

The call is the clearest sign yet of a possible regulatory clampdown on dark pools, which match trades in private with prices only revealed after a trade is done. Many are the modern, electronic equivalent of old telephone-brokered markets.

Growth of dark pools is being fuelled by "high-frequency" trading, which has sliced orders into ever smaller sizes on stock exchanges and other platforms.

That is causing asset managers and other institutions to direct larger trades towards dark pools to minimise the risk of prices moving against them.

But dark pools have generated controversy, with regulators scrutinising them amid questions over their transparency and whether too much pricing of shares takes place away from mainstream, or "lit", markets such as exchanges.

About 10 per cent of US shares are traded in dark pools, about half of that in Europe and a growing proportion in Asia.

Dark pools are run by independent operators or by banks - which call them "crossing networks" - or sometimes by exchanges themselves.

Iosco said that its principles were designed to "minimise the adverse impact of the increased use of dark pools and dark orders in transparent markets on the price discovery process".

It said that a technical committee studying dark pools had "focused on a number of areas that had been identified as pos sibly having adverse effects on the market", such as "transparency and price discovery, market fragmentation, knowledge of trading intentions, fair access; and the ability to assess actual trading volume in dark pools".

# Jeremy Grant

If there was ever a business in need of a new name, it is "dark pools".

This week, the role of these trading facilities is once again under the microscope after revelations that rapid electronic traders - possibly "high-frequency" traders (HFTs) - sniffed out what was going on in two leading European dark pools and profited from the information they found.

At all times, the priority is not to reveal who you are or to reveal at what price you want to trade. That is market sensitive information that can be used by rivals, jeopardising your trade, and explains why prices are not made public until matches are found.

Yet last week it emerged that slivers of information had leaked out of two dark pools, one operated by Chi-X and BATs, operators of two of the "multilateral trading facilities" (MTFs).

The information - contained in certain data feeds - gave enough clues to anyone who was interested about what orders certain large - although unnamed - participants had sitting in those pools. Traders could then place trades on the public exchanges - on which

### Trust in European dark pools was shaken last week

Within a few minutes of the discovery, volumes on Chi-Delta - the Chi-X platform - and on the BATS platform plunged as so-called "buyside" participants called their brokers with instructions to pull their orders, fearful their orders were being exploited.

By contrast volumes shot up on rivals like Turquoise where data feeds did not reveal such information.

Trust in market structures has already been badly shaken this month, following the "flash crash" on Wall Street, when computerised trading exacerbated a huge fall in stocks.

But the latest development in dark pools shows trust is in equally short supply in an increasingly important corner of the region's equity markets.

The sudden withdrawal of trades from the two platforms also raises questions over the role of high

## Exhibit 8.19 continued frequency trading in dark pools. Hitherto such traders, who seek to profit from minute changes in prices between trading venues, were assumed to operate only on exchanges and MTFs. But some suspect that they may be picking off trades in dark pools without the original poster of the order knowing.

Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, a US securities firm, says participants have to ask whether some HFTs are actually "predatory" in dark pools, by taking advantage of information they are not supposed to have. "People are going to say they thought they were able to trade, cloaked and anonymously, but now I am supporting a multi-million dollar industry called high-frequency trading," he says.

Themis believes the problem lies in the data feeds provided by trading venues. "Information in these feeds allows high-frequency trading firms to track when an investor changes price on his order, how much stock the investor is buying or selling in accumulation, as well as the ascertaining of hidden order flow."

Chi-Delta and BATS have changed their data feeds so that such so-called "information leakage" has stopped.

Asset managers and others using dark pools can protect themselves against predatory trading by stipulating that their orders can only interact with other orders if those orders are of a certain minimum size.

Rob McGrath, head of trading, Americas at Schroders, says his firm can protect itself "pretty well". But he says "in the past the exchanges had first look at your orders; now the high-frequency traders are using technology to find similar information".

## The London Stock Exchange

We will now concentrate on describing UK markets, although the principal features tend to be found in all stock exchanges.

### A short history of the LSE

Capital markets go back a long time. In the late Middle Ages securities very much like modern shares were issued and traded in the Italian city states, as were government bonds. The demand from investors in British companies to be able to buy and sell shares led to the creation of a market in London. At first this was very informal – holders of financial securities (e.g. shares) would meet at known places, especially coffee-houses, in the ancient part of London known as the City (the 'Square Mile' that the Romans built a wall around, just to the north-west of the Tower of London). Early in the nineteenth century the Stock Exchange developed a set of rules and procedures designed to enable investors to buy and sell shares with ease and to minimise the risk of fraud or unfairness.

Astonishing as it may seem given today's push for mergers of a number of national exchanges, in the heady days of the industrial boom times – especially the expansion in railways – in the second half of the nineteenth century, 15 stock markets were formed in England (Liverpool, Manchester, Huddersfield, Nottingham, Leicester, Bradford, Oldham, Hull, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, York, Halifax and Sheffield), five in Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Greenock) and three in Wales (Cardiff, Swansea and Newport). The boom times did not last, however, and survival for many of these exchanges was brief. Some continued on until the 1970s but either merged with the LSE or faded away. Modern communications meant that share trading could be conducted hundreds of miles from the company's base or the shareholders, and London amassed more and more trade, killing off the regional exchanges. There is, however, a move towards bringing back local stock exchanges to give local companies access to equity finance. Investbx was formed in 2007 in Birmingham with the aim of helping small to medium businesses raise capital for growth, although it has yet to take off.

### 'Big Bang'

Before the 'Big Bang' in 1986, brokers and other market service providers organised share and other security trading such that there was little competition, commission rates were kept high and trading was done on a face-to-face basis. It became clear in the 1970s and 1980s that the LSE was losing trade to overseas stock markets. For the LSE to remain competitive in the modern world, changes had to happen.

'Big Bang' is the term used for a collection of reforms that resulted in fixed broker commissions disappearing, foreign competitors being allowed to own member firms (market makers or brokers), and the screen-based computer system of trading replacing floor-based face-to-face trading.

The market makers and brokers quickly passed into the hands of large financial conglomerates. Commission fell sharply for large orders (from 0.4 per cent to around 0.2 per cent of the value traded). However, private clients (investors buying small quantities of shares on their own account) saw an initial slight rise in commission because this sector had previously been subsidised by the fees charged to the institutions. Brokers started to specialise. Some would offer the traditional service of advice and dealing, whereas others would offer a no-frills dealing-only service. This 'execution-only' service is now very cheap.

### Recent moves

After centuries of being an organisation owned and run by its members, in 2001 the LSE became a public limited company with its shares traded on a secondary market. It has come a long way from its clubby days. In 2004 the Stock Exchange moved from its historic site in Old Broad Street to Paternoster Square near St Paul's Cathedral. The exchange toyed with the idea of moving out of the City but decided that its identity was tied too closely to the Square Mile to move outside, and the proximity of other professionals in the same area was too convenient.

### Variety of securities traded

The LSE is a marketplace for many other types of financial securities besides shares - see Exhibit 8.20.

Exhibit 8.20 Variety of financial instruments sold on the London Stock Exchange

There are four types of fixed-interest securities traded in London: government bonds, local authority bonds, corporate bonds and Eurobonds. As well as long-term bonds the LSE trades medium-term notes and specialised types of bond such as those that are convertible into shares. Specialist securities, such as warrants and covered warrants, are normally bought and traded by a few investors who are particularly knowledgeable in investment matters (warrants are a type of derivative security and are discussed in Chapter 9).

### Depositary receipts

There has been a rapid development of a market in **depository receipts**. These are certificates that can be bought and sold, and represent evidence of ownership of a company's shares held by a depository. Their purpose is to allow investments in foreign companies without the rigmarole of going through all necessary checks and regulations. Thus, an Indian company's shares could be packaged in, say, groups of five by a depository (usually a bank) which then sells a certificate representing a bundle of shares. The depository receipt can be denominated in a currency other than the corporation's domestic currency and dividends can be received in the currency of the depository receipt (say, pounds) rather than the currency of the original shares (say, rupees). These are attractive securities for sophisticated international investors because they may be more liquid and more easily traded than the underlying shares.

The investment bank J.P. Morgan created the first American Depositary Receipt (ADR) in 1927 and today is the world's largest ADR depository. The non-American ones are usually referred to as Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs). They may be used to avoid settlement (see later), foreign exchange and foreign ownership (government restrictions on investment by foreigners) difficulties which may exist in the company's home market. From the company's point of view depositary receipts are attractive because they allow a market in the company's shares (even though they are wrapped up in a depositary receipt), permitting fund raising and the other benefits of a quotation on a regulated global capital market without the company needing to jump the regulatory hurdles necessary to place its shares directly on an exchange for them to be traded.

DRs have been very useful as a means for companies in emerging countries (such as Kazakhstan, Brazil or India) to raise capital from the developed world's exchanges. However, emerging nations have developed to such an extent that they now have wealthy investors looking to invest in the developed world – see Exhibit 8.21.

A swathe of emerging market stock exchanges are lining up to launch depositary receipt programmes, allowing local investors to access foreign companies without leaving their home market.

The move would also ease the way for western companies to raise capital from increasingly wealthy emerging market investors, mirroring a trend that has seen emerging market companies raise almost 200bn (125bn, €151bn) by launching American and

(European-listed) global depository receipts since 2005.

In May, Standard Chartered, the UK-headquartered but emerging market-focused bank, blazed a trail by listing the first Indian depository receipt – raising 500m in the process.

Telefónica, the Spanish telecoms company, and Dufry Group, a Swiss retailer, have listed Brazilian depositary receipts, while a number of Indian companies have launched DRs in Singapore. Anthony Moro, head of emerging markets for BNY Mellon's depository receipts operation, said he expected the process to accelerate, with five to 10 "super regional exchanges", such as Dubai, South Africa, Hong Kong and Brazil, emerging as centres for DR activity.

"We are calling it alphabet DRs and it's a topic that we are getting an incredible amount of interest in," said Mr Moro.

"It's a concept that is catching on because the DR mechanism make it very easy to go across borders. It makes something global look like something local. Investors will always prefer to invest in their home market if they can."

Claudine Gallagher, global head of depository receipts at JPMorgan, added: "I definitely think it's a trend. Taiwan, Japan, Russia and Hong Kong have all passed regulations to allow DRs in their markets. Markets like Brazil, Singapore and Taiwan have grown up. They have breadth and depth. The local investor base is savvy enough now and interested in having foreign diversification."

Ms Gallagher said she expected to see DR issuance on the Hong Kong market "in the next six to nine months".

Standard Chartered and rival HSBC have said they intend to issue DRs on the Shanghai exchange if and when Chinese regulations allow.

Depository receipt programmes, which share the same pot of liquidity with the primary listing, also have an advantage over multiple stock listings, which create fragmented pools of liquidity.

However, Mr Moro said companies would only list DRs in countries in which they had an established footprint, given the compliance costs of operating sponsored programmes.

Mr Dagg said most companies seeking to raise capital were still

## The LSE primary market

Through its primary market in listed securities, the LSE has succeeded in encouraging large sums of money to flow annually to firms wanting to invest and grow. On its different markets, it has quoted (at 28 February 2011) 2,650 companies with a total market value of £4,153,960 million. The vast majority of these companies raised funds by selling shares, bonds or other financial instruments through the LSE either when they first floated or by issuing further shares in subsequent years (e.g. through a rights issue – see Chapter 9). There are 1,178 companies on the Exchange's market for smaller and younger companies, the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), which started in 1995. These companies, too, have raised precious funds to allow growth. The Main Market (MM) includes 318 listings for companies registered outside the UK, and 86 listings for TechMARK companies, which specialise in innovative technology and healthcare – see Exhibit 8.22. Within the Main Market there are additional small markets for specialist funds (SFM – specialist investment funds such as hedge funds, private equity funds, and certain emerging market and specialist property funds, seeking admission to a public market in London, can use this market to target institutional, professional and highly knowledgeable investors) and professional securities (PSM – this is where depositary receipts are quoted and traded).

Newly listed UK firms on the LSE raised new capital by selling  $£6,998$  million of shares in 2010. Another  $\pounds 12.3$  billion was raised by already listed firms selling shares through further issues of equity and by selling sterling bonds, convertibles and preference shares. In addition, listed companies sold  $\pounds 184.4$  billion of Eurobonds to investors. Over on the more lightly regulated AIM market  $\pounds 3,550$  million was raised - see Exhibit 8.23. At the same time as raising fresh capital, companies transfer money the other way by, for example, redeeming bonds, paying interest on debt or dividends on shares. Nevertheless, it is clear that large sums are raised for companies through the primary market. Each year there is great interest and excitement inside dozens of companies as they prepare for flotation. Since 1999, there have been almost 900 new admissions on the MM and over 2,000 on the AIM; these issues have raised billions for the companies involved.

The requirements for joining the MM are stringent. The listing particulars should give a complete picture of the company: its trading history, financial record, management and business prospects. It should (normally) have at least a three-year trading history and has to make at least 25 per cent of its

## The secondary markets

There is a huge amount of shareholder-to-shareholder trading. In a typical month, more than 12 million bargains (trades between buyers and sellers) are struck between investors in shares on the LSE, worth over £200 billion. The size of bargains varies enormously, from £500 trades by private investors to hundreds of millions by the major funds.

The secondary market turnover exceeds the primary market sales. Indeed, the amount raised in the primary equity market in a year is about the same as the value of shares that trade hands daily in the secondary market. This high level of activity ensures a liquid market, enabling shares to change ownership speedily, at low cost and without large movements in price – one of the main objectives of a well-run exchange.

## How stock exchanges work

### Types of trading

Traditionally, shares were traded between two traders, face to face. A few stock exchanges around the world still have a place where buyers and sellers (or at least their representatives) meet to trade. For example, the NYSE continues to make some use of a large trading floor with thousands of face-to-face deals taking place every working day (open outcry trading). This is the traditional image of a stock market, and if television reporters have a story about what is going on in the world's security markets, they often show an image of traders rushing around, talking quickly amid a flurry of small slips of paper on the NYSE trading floor. Most trading now, however, is done silently in front of banks of computers, with deals being completed in nano-seconds. The stress levels for those dealing remain as high, if not higher, than ever, as now a slight mistake with a finger on a keyboard can cause mayhem.

Quote-driven trading was how most stock exchanges were operated. With this type of approach, market makers give a price at which they would buy (lower price) or sell (higher price), and make their profits on the margins between buying and selling. Traditionally, they operated in 'trading pits' and used an 'open outcry' system of trading, i.e. shouting and using hand signals to make trades, much like you might see with bookmakers at a small horse race meeting. They were able to adjust their prices according to what other traders were doing. Although this type of trading still takes place, it has been superseded by electronic trading. Market makers input their prices ('bid' is the price at which they are willing to buy and 'offer' or 'ask' is the price at which they are willing to sell) to a computer system and dealing takes place electronically.

Criticism of trading systems based on market makers quoting bid and offer prices focused on the size of the middleman's (the market maker's) margin and led to the development of order-driven trading, where buyers trade with sellers at a single price so that there is no bid-offer spread. Most stock exchanges in the world now operate this type of system. These markets allow buy and sell orders to be entered on a central computer, and investors are automatically matched (they are sometimes called matched-bargain systems or order book trading). In 1997, the LSE introduced an order-driven service known as SETS (Stock Exchange Electronic Trading System) and I will use this as an example to explain how order-driven trading works.

# SETS

The SETS electronic order book uses powerful computer systems to execute millions of trades a day in milliseconds. Traders (via brokers) enter the prices at which they are willing to buy or sell as well as the quantity of shares they want to trade. They can then wait for the market to move to the price they set as their limit. Alternatively, they can instruct brokers to transact immediately at the best price currently available on the order book system. Trades are then executed by the system if there is a match between a buy order price and a sell order price. These prices are displayed anonymously to the entire market. An example of prices and quantities is shown in the lower half of Exhibit 8.25 – a reproduction of a SETS screen as seen by brokers.

The buy orders are shown on the left and the sell orders on the right. So, at the bottom of the screen, we can observe for Lloyd's GRP's shares someone (or more than one person) has entered that they are willing to buy 100,000 shares at a maximum price of  $69.92\mathrm{p}$  (bottom line on screen). Someone else has entered that they would like to sell 6,930 shares at a minimum price of  $70.53\mathrm{p}$ . Clearly the computer cannot match these two orders and neither of these two investors will be able to trade. They will either have to adjust their limit prices or wait until the market moves in their favour.

As we travel up the screen we observe a closing of the gap between the prices buyers are willing to pay and the offering price of sellers. On the seventh line from the bottom we see that buyers want 28,169 shares at  $70.13\mathrm{p}$  whereas sellers are prepared to accept  $70.23\mathrm{p}$  for 5,054 shares. Now we are getting much closer to a match. Indeed, if we look above the yellow strip we can see the price where buyers and sellers were last matched – the 'last traded price' is  $70.18\mathrm{p}$ . These screens are available to market participants at all times and so they are able to judge where to pitch their price limits. For example, if I was a buyer of 5,000 shares entering the market I would not be inclined to offer more than  $70.20\mathrm{p}$  given the current state of supply and demand. However, if I was a seller of 5,000 shares I would recognise that the price offered would not have to fall below  $70.17\mathrm{p}$  to attract buyers. If, however, I was a buyer of 130,000 shares rather than just 5,000 I would have two options: I could set a maximum price of  $70.20\mathrm{p}$  in which case I would transact for 87,116 immediately but would leave the other 42,884 unfilled order in the market hoping for a general market price decline; alternatively, I could set my limit at  $70.44\mathrm{p}$  in which case I could transact with those investors prepared to sell at  $70.20\mathrm{p}$ ,  $70.23\mathrm{p}$ ,  $70.43\mathrm{p}$  and  $70.44\mathrm{p}$ . The unfilled orders of the sellers at  $70.44\mathrm{p}$  (130,000–118,170) are carried forward on SETS.

Supporters of the older quote-driven system say that a major problem with the order-driven system is that there may be few or no shares offered at prices close to a market clearing rate and so little trade can take place. In other words, the market can be very illiquid. There may indeed be times when no sellers are posting sensible prices and other times when buyers are scarce. This is when the quote-driven system may be more liquid because market makers who make a book in a company's shares must continuously offer prices and are obliged to trade at the price shown. By way of counter-criticism, it is alleged there have been times when it has been difficult to contact

# Exhibit 8.25 A typical SETS screen market makers to trade at their displayed prices, even though in theory they are obliged to make themselves available to quote and trade at bid and offer prices throughout the trading day. To improve trading liquidity on SETS, in 2007 the system was modified so that market makers can now post prices on it. Thus it offers a continuous order book with automatic execution, but also has market makers providing continuous bid and offer prices for many shares. It is thought that by having the two systems combined there will be tighter bid-offer spreads, greater transparency of trades and improved liquidity.

# Clearing and settlement

When a trade has been completed and reported to the exchange it is necessary to clear the trade. That is, the exchange ensures that all reports of the trade are reconciled to make sure all parties are in agreement as to the number and the price of shares traded. The exchange also checks that the buyer and seller have the cash and securities to do the deal. Also the company registrar is notified of the change in ownership. Later the transfer of ownership from seller to buyer has to take place; this is called settlement. These days clearing frequently does not just mean checking that a buyer and a seller agree on the deal; the clearing house also acts as a 'central counterparty' which acts as a buyer to every seller and as a seller to every buyer. This eliminates the risk of failure to complete a deal by guaranteeing that shares will be delivered against payment and vice versa. Clearing houses and central counterparties (CCPs in Europe, Central Counterparty Clearing (CCCs) in the US) provide an invaluable service – they execute and guarantee every aspect of the transaction. Instead of having to wait for cheque clearance, or documents to be signed and arrive by post, traders set up accounts with clearing houses and CCPs so that transactions can be carried out immediately, with the CCP absorbing any loss should either default. With a CCP investors can also 'net' their trades, so that if one part of the investing institution has bought 1 million shares while another has sold 1.5 million the trades are paired so that settlement is for only 500,000 shares.

The LSE's Italian partner already operates its own clearing house, Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (CC&G), but for most of its UK share trading LSE uses LCH.Clearnet. At the time of writing the exchange was thinking about building its own clearer in London and then expanding it into a pan-European operation – see Exhibit 8.26.

By Jeremy Grant and Phillip Stafford

The London Stock Exchange signalled yesterday a big shift in how the clearing business operates in the City of London by saying it was "reviewing" its long-standing relationship with LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house.

The move makes it more likely that the LSE will build its own clearer in London. The 210-year-old bourse is one of the last big exchanges yet to fall into line with a global trend towards exchange ownership of post-trade businesses, especially in derivatives.

Ownership of a clearing house helps generate extra revenues in the form of clearing fees on top of the trading fees already charged by exchanges. It has become increasingly important strategically to exchanges as they vie for business in equities and derivatives.

A clearing house stands between a buyer and seller in a trade, stepping in to complete the transaction in case either party defaults.

The LSE has long lacked its own clearing house, relying instead on LCH.Clearnet, the product of a merger in 2003 of the London Clearing House and Clearnet, former clearer for the Paris bourse.

Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, said the lack of "in-house capabilities" in the post-trade business and "dependency on certain not-always-ideal external suppliers" had prevented the London bourse from "innovating successfully".

The Frenchman, who arrived at the helm of the LSE a year ago, has made building a bigger derivatives and post-trade business a priority as the exchange reduces its reliance on share trading, where it faces fierce competition from Chi-X Europe, BATS Europe and others.

The European clearing and settlement system compares badly with the US one, being more expensive, which is not helped by the fact that most clearing in Europe is done by organisations owned by the exchanges where the trade took place – see Exhibit 8.27. The article also discusses the dangers to the financial system caused by the promises made to buyers and sellers by the CCP – they still have to buy from the seller even if the buyer reneges on the deal and so in a major downturn in the market they could end up holding assets that are plummeting in value.

By Jeremy Grant

Competition between trading venues in Europe is so brutal that the fees charged by exchanges and their smaller rivals - such as Chi-X Europe - are at rock-bottom levels.

Yet while this is obviously good for traders, the overall cost of trad ing on European equities markets is still stubbornly high - up to eight times as expensive as in the US, according to many estimates.

The reason lies in the "plumbing" that sits underneath most exchange trading: the unglamorous post-trade services of clearing and settlement that ensure that trades are completed and that cash and assets change hands at the end of the trading cycle.

Europe has multiple post-trade providers, with no fewer than seven clearing houses and 17 "central securities depositories", which handle settlement. By contrast, the US has one, quasi-utility clearer for cash equities in the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.

Clearers in Europe started to compete with each other with the advent of Mifid - the markets in financial instruments directive - which allowed competition at the trading level.

But full competition, and further downward pressure on fees, has not happened and clearing houses have largely stuck to servicing the exchanges with which they have long relationships. Clearers owned outright by exchanges - such as Eurex Clearing, owned by Deutsche Börse - overwhelmingly clear for their parent.

This lack of competition has kept trading costs high, deterring traders.

Brad Hunt, managing director of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs in London, says: "Fragmented clearing in Europe is inefficient on many levels and this conspires to keep costs for end-investors in European markets stubbornly high."

The European Commission had hoped to change this by insisting that clearingers create links with each other to give traders a choice where their trades are sent for clearing.

But the process, known as interoperability, has ground to a halt in recent months. In the wake of the crisis, regulators are no longer as focused on engendering competition; they fear interoperability will create risks in the financial system.

Regulators are studying whether two-way or three-way linkages between clearers - as interoperability would create - could trigger a domino effect if one clearer were to default.

For interoperability to work, Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, says, a way must be found to harmonise standards across Europe when it comes to clearing houses' regulatory capital and risk management policies. Currently, such policies differ between clearing houses.

Clearers should be regulated by central banks, which would be their "lenders of last resort", says Mr Rolet. At present, they are mostly regulated by financial market watchdogs.

For the LSE, as in most of Europe, share settlement is  $\mathrm{T} + 3$ , which means that shares are transferred to new owners three days after the trade takes place, but there is pressure to move to  $\mathrm{T} + 2$  - see Exhibit 8.28.

To facilitate settlement a company called Euroclear UK & Ireland uses the CREST system and acts as a central securities depository (CSD) for the UK and Ireland. CREST enables dematerialisation by keeping an electronic register of the shares, a record of shares traded on stock markets and provides an electronic means of settlement and registration. This system is cheaper and

European regulators are considering ways to cut the time it takes for securities to be processed after trades are done in a bid to reduce risks to the system in the event of defaults and other large financial failures.

Reducing the so-called "settlement cycle" would be one of the biggest moves taken by regulators in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

Settlement is the post-trade process that ensures securities are exchanged for cash, completing a transaction such as the trading of stocks and shares.

Currently settlement in most of Europe takes place three days after the trade is made, in a system known as "T+3". Germany uses T+2.

Reducing the cycle by a day would cut by a third the time it takes for a deal to be finalised – and thus reduce the scope for failures such as defaults while transactions work their way through settlement and custody processes. It would also make it easier for the region to handle corporate actions such as rights issues and takeover bids.

The idea of reducing the settlement cycle was identified before the financial crisis as a way of harmonising pan-European post-trade structures to make the region's capital markets more efficient.

But the issue has received fresh impetus since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, whose default raised alarm over counterparty risk.

quicker than the old one which used paper – ownership is now transferred with a few strokes of a keyboard. The volume of this trading is huge, around 1.3 million transactions daily in over 16,000 securities, with a value in excess of £1.4 trillion. Under the CREST system shares are usually held in the name of a nominee company rather than in the name of the actual purchaser. Brokers and investment managers run these nominee accounts. Thus, when an investor trades, their broker holds their shares electronically in their (the broker's) nominee account and arranges settlement through their membership of the CREST system. This increases the speed of transactions enormously. There might be dozens of investors with shares held by a particular nominee company. The nominee company appears as the registered owner of the shares as far as the company (say Sainsbury or BT) is concerned. Despite this, the beneficial owners receive all dividends and any sale proceeds. Some investors oppose the CREST system because under such a system they do not automatically receive annual reports and other documentation, such as an invitation to the annual general meeting. They also potentially lose the right to vote (after all, the company does not know who the beneficial owners are). Those investors who take their ownership of a part of a company seriously can insist on remaining outside of CREST. In this way they receive share certificates and are treated as the real owners of the business. This is more expensive when share dealing, but that is not a great concern for investors who trade infrequently.

There is a compromise position: personal membership of CREST. The investor is then both the legal owner and the beneficial owner of the shares, and also benefits from rapid (and cheap) electronic share settlement. The owner will be sent all company communications and retain voting rights. However, this is more expensive than the normal CREST accounts.

# SETSqx

Trading on SETS is for companies whose trading is liquid, i.e. large companies with a high proportion of the shares held by a wide range of investors (a large free float) so there are plenty of shares traded each day. There are other means of trading for less frequently traded shares. SETSqx (Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service – quotes and crosses) trades in MM and AIM shares which are less liquid and not traded on SETS. SETSqx combines order-book technology (similar to the SETS method of trading) with the best of the LSE's existing quote-driven trading. On SETSqx a single market maker's quote can be displayed if a market maker is interested in quoting a price. (Ideally, the exchange would like many market makers' quoting prices so that competition encourages keener prices for share owners.)

An investor wanting to trade with a market maker can do so in the normal way, but also can connect, usually via brokers, to the electronic system and put onto the system's screen display an order for shares stating a price at which they would like to trade, either to sell or to buy – particularly useful if there are no market makers in that share. If someone else on the system likes the displayed price they can phone the originator and a deal is done.

This may still leave some orders for trades unexecuted (i.e. no one phones up and trades at the advertised price). To cope with this, or to trade shares anonymously, throughout the day there are auctions in which investors make bids and the system matches up buyers and sellers. Now all MM shares trade on either SETS or SETSqx.

# Quote-driven trading

The LSE's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation (SEAQ) system deals mainly in smaller, less liquid companies not on its MM. It is the LSE's quote-driven service that allows market makers to quote prices in AIM securities (those AIM securities not traded on SETS or SETSqx) as well as a number of fixed-interest securities. It lists over 800 companies on its electronic notice board where market makers display prices at which they are willing to buy or sell.

The SEAQ computer gathers together the bid-offer quotes from all the market makers that make a market in that particular share. These competing quotations are then available to brokers and other financial institutions linked up to the SEAQ system.

Exhibit 8.29 goes through the stage in buying or selling on the LSE's SEAQ system. What happens when you, as an investor, telephone your broker to buy shares is this: when you mentioned the company name the broker immediately punched into their computer the company code. So within a second of your mentioning your interest in the company the broker has on their screen all the prices that different market makers are willing to pay as well as all the prices at which they are willing to sell the shares. It can be confusing and time consuming for the broker to look at all the prices to find the best current rates. Fortunately they do not have to do this as the screen displays a 'yellow strip' above the market makers' prices, which provides the identity of the market makers offering the best bid and offer prices (these are called touch prices). It is the price in the yellow strip that the broker will immediately report to you over the telephone. So, you might be told 105-109. If you were happy with 109p you would then instruct your broker to buy, say, 1,000 shares.

# Exhibit 8.29 The SEAQ quote-driven system

The market makers are obliged to deal (up to a certain number of shares) at the price quoted, but they have the freedom to adjust prices after deals are completed. Transactions may be completed by the broker speaking to the market maker on the telephone, but an increasing number of trades are completed electronically. All trades are reported to the central electronic computer exchange and are disseminated to market participants (usually within three minutes) so that they are aware of the price at which recent trades were completed.

The underlying logic of the quote-driven system is that through the competitive actions of numerous market makers, investors are able to buy or sell at any time at the best price. A problem arises for some very small or infrequently traded firms. Market makers are reluctant to commit capital to holding shares in such firms and so for some there may be only one market maker's quote, for others there may be none. These shares have a better trading environment on SETSqx.

# Share borrowing, lending and shorting

If a share price is expected to fall, a trader can borrow shares (paying commission to the lender) for, say, a month, sell them immediately at the market price and hope to buy the requisite number of shares in a month's time at the expected lower price. This practice is known as shorting, or going short, selling shares before buying them. If the unexpected happens and the share price rises, the trader will make a loss on his shorted shares. The opposite of going short is going long, where a dealer buys securities and holds on to them.

Brokers, sometimes acting on behalf of institutions, lend some of the securities in their care to satisfy trading needs, taking commission from the deals. The lenders get equivalent securities back at the end of the loan term and the borrowers get a chance to trade without the injection of fresh capital.

# The ownership of UK shares

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (Owns) give the ownership of UK shares from 1963 to 2008. There have been some dramatic changes – see Exhibit 8.30.

The tax-favoured status of pension funds made them a very attractive vehicle for savings, resulting in billions of pounds being put into them each year. Most of this money used to be invested in equities, with pension funds becoming the most influential investing group on the stock market, taking nearly one-third of the market in UK shares. However, in the last decade pension funds have been taking money out of quoted shares and placing it in other investments such as bonds and private equity.

Insurance companies similarly rose in significance, increasing their share of quoted equities from 10 per cent to about one-fifth by the 1990s, after which they too moved their investments to bonds and overseas equities.

The group which shows the greatest decrease is ordinary individuals holding shares directly. Small personal investors used to dominate the market, with 54 per cent of quoted shares in 1963. This sector has shown a continuous gradual decline, falling to 13 per cent. The reason for the decline is not that individual investors have become disinterested in the stock market but that they have shown a tendency to switch from direct investment to collective investment vehicles, so probably the same number of people (if not more) are investing, but in a different way. They gain benefits of diversification and skilled management by putting their savings into unit and investment trusts or into endowments and other savings schemes offered by the insurance companies. Although the mode of investment has changed from direct to indirect, Britain remains a society with a deep interest in the stock market. Very few people are immune from the performance of the LSE. The vast majority of the UK population have a pension plan or endowment savings scheme, or a unit trust investment.

The most remarkable trend has been the increasing share of equities held by overseas investors: only 7 per cent in 1963, but over 40 per cent in 2008. This increase partly reflects international mergers where the new company is listed in the UK, and foreign companies sometimes floating their UK subsidiaries but holding on to a large shareholding. It also reflects an increasing tendency of investors to buy shares in overseas markets. Exhibit 8.31 discusses the increasing influence of overseas investors in the UK stock market. The rising internationalisation of share ownership is not just manifest in the UK. For each of the following countries more than 30 per cent of the domestic company shares is owned by overseas organisations: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Poland, France, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Austria and Denmark. The higher level of international institutional ownership is changing companies, bringing more stringent corporate governance to orientate the companies more in shareholders' favour, an increase in transparency, including more open reporting on company performance, and more manager engagement with shareholders.

Also note the rise in the 'other' category over the last decade. This is largely due to the rising importance of hedge funds and venture capital companies.

# Rising foreign ownership could be good for the Footsie

Anousha Sakoui

One clear trend in the UK equity market in recent years has been the falling proportion of UK shares held by domestic investors, and the rising number held by international investors.

The latest data show UK investors now hold less than 60 per cent of the UK stock market, whereas foreign ownership is at 41.5 per cent, a record high.

At the current rate, the majority of UK plc will be in foreign hands within a decade. That is an event that will inevitability prompt a bout of national soul-searching, in much the same way that the recent sale of Cadbury to Kraft of the US did. But does it matter to the performance of the stock market who owns UK shares? Possibly. There is some anecdotal evidence that UK funds are more reluctant sellers of the UK shares than international investors, who have a greater number of companies they can reinvest their funds in. But selling by UK investors seems for the moment to be more than matched by purchases by international investors.

Long-term holders of UK shares, such as pension funds and insurance groups, now own around 26 per cent of the UK equity market, according to the latest data from the Office of National Statistics. This is a big change from 1998, when they owned 43.3 per cent.

Last year's survey by the National Association of Pension Funds was particularly telling. Some 14 per cent of pension schemes do not invest in UK equities at all and less than one fifth of the industry's total assets are in UK equities, down from 21.1 per cent in 2008.

Meanwhile, according to the Owns, foreign ownership of UK shares reached 41.5 per cent at the end of 2008. James Agnew, chairman of corporate broking at Deutsche Bank, estimates European investor holdings have been constant since 2000 at around 18 per cent, while US investors have increased their holdings from around 9 per cent to 16 per cent and the rest of the world's ownership has doubled from around 4 per cent to 8 per cent.

Some foreign investors have emerged as the largest holders of UK shares over this period. They include sovereign wealth funds such as Norway's national pension fund and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. This trend of increasing foreign interest in UK shares is expected to continue. That can be seen through the recent purchase of Cadbury and it can be seen in other recent corporate moves.

One key attraction for foreign investors is that UK companies derive a very large proportion of their sales and profits from international markets. Many FTSE 100 companies have high levels of exposure to emerging markets growth.

# Concluding comments

Equity markets are often portrayed as casinos. News reports show frantic traders speculating on where prices are going next, becoming euphoric if the shares have had a good run up, or thoroughly depressed if the market is down. Indeed, it is fair to say that there are many people who treat the equity markets as places to make a quick buck, who spend their lives and great deal of money trying to gain a short-term trading edge over others, not bothering to understand the underlying businesses behind the shares.

This image is unfortunate because alongside the speculators are millions of investors who genuinely try to understand the long-term prospects for a company, calculating a value for it and then deciding whether to allocate money to the firm to help it grow, to build that new factory to make recently invented medical instruments or that latest mobile phone. Through the actions of these investors society gains new products, industries and wealth as money is taken from the dying sectors and reallocated to the new frontiers. It is not only society at large that benefits from the presence of equity markets – anyone with savings in a pension scheme will want a portion of that money placed in shares with prospects of high rates of return over the next few decades.

To meet these societal needs stock markets have evolved through their history, never more so than in the last decade. Where before we had national stock markets in the financial centres of each country, today we have many markets combining to form international groups such as NYSE

Euronext. To provide some competition for the national monopolies we have seen the growth of alternative trading platforms such as multilateral trading facilities and dark pools. At the same time technological innovation has changed the method of trading shares so that it is now very much built around sophisticated computer systems that can handle millions of transactions in a day, and can complete thousands of trades in less than the time it takes to blink. We have also seen the amazing growth of stock markets in Asia, to the point where they are a serious challenge to the old centres of equity finance in Europe and North America. Indeed, it is a fairly safe prediction to say that many Asian markets will come to be at least as great as London and New York in the next few years. This makes sense: every society needs equity investors to assist growth through the mobilisation of savings into productive use; and every investor would prefer to have the liquidity that is offered by stock markets than have the difficulty of finding a buyer should they need to sell.

## Key points and concepts
- Shares were first issued as a way of raising large amounts of risk capital for a venture from numerous investors, each being offered a share of profits.
- Ordinary shares represent part ownership of a company. There is no obligation to pay a dividend or redeem shares.
Limited liability restricts the amount of responsibility that a shareholder has for a company's debts.
The rights of ordinary shareholders: (1) to exercise some control over the company (2) a claim to a share of the company's profits in the form of dividend payments, and in a worst-case scenario, a right to share in the proceeds of a liquidation sale of the firm's assets (3) to receive information about the company's progress.
- Dividend payments, annual or semi-annual, are paid at the discretion of directors but these decisions are approved by shareholders.
- Debt finance is an alternative means of raising finance for company, but requires obligatory repayments at regular intervals. Lower rates of return are offered on debt than on equity. Debt does not carry rights of control over the firm.
- Preference shares: advantages to a company of preference shares are:
- the dividend may be omitted;
- less influence over management because they have no voting rights (normally);
- no increase in dividend if a company makes good profits;
- alternative source of finance if more borrowing is unavailable.
- Disadvantages to a company of preference shares are:
- rate of return is higher than for debt;
- preference share dividends are not tax deductible.
- Types of preference shares are:
- cumulative - if dividend payments are missed they are carried forward;
- participating - extra payments if company has high profits;
- redeemable - they have a finite life; convertible - they may be converted into ordinary shares;
variable rate - variable dividend is paid.

Other types of shares are:

- non-voting/reduced voting - issued when current shareholders do not wish to dilute their influence by issuing ordinary voting shares;
- deferred - in a poor year holders receive no dividend;
- golden - they have extraordinary powers.

Stock exchanges – where governments, industries and investors can buy and sell shares and other financial instruments, thus contributing to the economic well-being of a country by encouraging the mobilisation of savings.

Stock exchanges have merged to form large conglomerates.

A well-run stock exchange:

- a 'fair game' takes place;
- it is well regulated to avoid abuses, negligence and fraud;
- it is reasonably cheap to carry out transactions;
- there is a large number of buyers and sellers.

Benefits of a well-run exchange:

- firms can find funds and grow;
- allocation of society's scarce capital;
- shareholders benefit from the availability of a speedy, cheap secondary market if they want to sell; enhances the status and publicity of companies;
- mergers can be facilitated better by a quotation;
- improves corporate behaviour.

Tasks for stock exchanges

- supervision of trading to ensure fairness and efficiency;
- the authorisation of market participants such as brokers and market makers;
- creation of an environment in which prices are formed efficiently and without distortion;
- organisation of the settlement of transactions;
- the regulation of the admission of companies to the exchange and the regulation of companies on the exchange;
- the dissemination of information.
- Mifid (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) aims to harmonise European trading, encourage competition and protect the consumer.
- MTFs (Multilateral Trading Facilities) bring together buyers and sellers of financial instruments and are less regulated than the stock exchanges. Their trading platforms are electronic trading facilities carrying out trading quickly and sometimes without human intervention.
Algorithmic trading is trading carried out by computers using algorithms.
- HFT (high-frequency trading) is blisteringly quick electronic trading which gives its users milli-seconds' advantage.
- Dark pools are anonymous trading systems designed to negate problems of openly trading large blocks of shares.
Big Bang happened in 1986 and revolutionised the London Stock Exchange. It meant:
- the end of fixed broker commission;
- foreign competition being allowed;
- face-to-face trading was replaced by computer trading.
- London Stock Exchange used to be the leading stock exchange for international shares; now huge growth in the US and developing countries is rivalling the LSE.
- Depositary receipts are negotiable certificates proving ownership of foreign shares and provide an easy means of trading in foreign shares.
- Order-driven trading is used by most stock exchanges around the world; buy and sell orders are entered on to the central computer and automatically matched; problems can occur if there is poor liquidity.
- SETS (Stock Exchange Electronic Trading System) carries out the LSE's electronic order book trading.
- Clearing ensures that all reports of the trade are reconciled to make sure all parties are in agreement as to the number and the price of shares traded. The exchange also checks that the buyer and seller have the cash and securities to do the deal. Also the company registrar is notified of the change in ownership. Usually the clearing houses also act as a 'central counterparty', which is a buyer to every seller and as a seller to every buyer.
- Settlement: the transfer of ownership from seller to buyer takes place. CREST, the UK settlement company, holds shares in nominee accounts enabling trading to be done instantaneously, and keeps a register of all shares and trading.
- SETSqx (Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service - quotes and crosses) trades in less liquid MM and AIM shares through a system that combines market makers' quotes, direct posting and agreement of trades and daily auctions.
- Quote-driven trading involves market makers making prices in shares and trading with other market makers on behalf of investors.
- SEAQ (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation) is the LSE's quote-driven system dealing in companies not on the MM.
- Shorting, or going short: a trader can borrow shares and sell them immediately at the market price, hoping to buy the requisite amount of shares at a lower price at a later date to replace the borrowed shares and thus make a profit.
Ownership of UK shares -
- Pension and insurance funds own a substantial proportion, but in the past decade the proportion has dropped as they invested overseas and in bonds.
- There has been a large decrease in individual shareholders caused by investors putting money into collective investment instead.
- There has been a big increase in foreign investment in UK and European shares.
