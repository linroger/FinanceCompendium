# Raising share capital

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

Much of what financial markets and institutions do is related to raising finance for companies. This chapter will help orientate you in the world of equity finance raising for stock market quoted companies. By the end of the chapter you should be able to: explain the processes involved in a company joining a stock market to have its shares traded in a regulated market for the first time. This includes describing the role of various financial advisers and institutions;

■ outline the main ongoing regulations for a company quoted on the London Stock Exchange, including disclosure of price-sensitive information, reporting profits and other accounts, restrictions on directors and the corporate governance regulations;

■ demonstrate understanding of the figures presented in the financial pages for shares and share indices; run through the main considerations for rights issues, placings, open offers, vendor placings, scrip issues, share splits, warrants, share buy-backs and special dividends.

Many institutions assist a company in floating its shares on a stock market for the first time, as well as help a company to raise additional equity finance in the years following the initial public offering. This chapter describes their various roles, from investment bankers acting as sponsors to corporate brokers, registrars and lawyers. It also explains the regulations for stock market quoted companies, such as the need to make public all price-sensitive information or the restrictions placed on directors.

It is important that a student of finance be able to read and interpret the data shown in the financial pages of newspapers, particularly the Financial Times. To help in this area the chapter has reproductions of the equity tables in the  $FT$ , together with explanations of what the entries mean.

Throughout this chapter there is focus on the UK, but the key principles are in place in all major financial centres.

# Floating on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange

Once a company reaches a certain size, it has the possibility of floating on a stock market, 'going public', through a 'new issue' of shares also called an initial public offering (IPO). To become a listed company is a major step for a firm, and the substantial sums of money involved can lead to a new, accelerated phase of business growth. While this opens up fresh possibilities of investment finance from outside investors it also brings the disadvantage for current shareholders of giving away some influence and control as well as incurring some significant costs. Many, if not most, companies are content to grow without the aid of stock markets. For example, J.C. Bamford (JCB), which manufactures earth-moving machines, has built a large, export award-winning company, without needing to bring in outside shareholders, and remains a private company.

The legal implications of obtaining a quotation as a listed company are enormous. Companies wishing to be listed on the Main Market have to sign a listing agreement that commits directors to certain standards of behaviour and levels of reporting to shareholders. The United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA), part of the Financial Services Authority, rigorously enforces a set of demanding rules.

Joining the MM of the LSE involves two stages. The securities (usually shares) have to be: (a) admitted to the Official List by the UKLA (hence the term 'listed' company) and also (b) admitted by the Exchange for trading.

Going public can wrack up huge costs - see Exhibit 9.1. The cost as a proportion of the amount raised varies but is usually at least 5 per cent and can be as high as one-third - many of the costs are fixed so if only a small number of new shares are issued the percentage costs are high.

Exhibit 9.1 Typical floating costs for a company issuing £20 million of shares in an IPO on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange

<table><tr><td></td><td>£</td></tr><tr><td>Financial advisers</td><td>200,000–400,000</td></tr><tr><td>Underwriters</td><td>400,000–1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Legal expenses</td><td>200,000–400,000</td></tr><tr><td>Accounting</td><td>100,000–300,000</td></tr><tr><td>Listing fees</td><td>&lt; 20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Printing, public relations, etc.</td><td>&lt; 100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total costs</td><td>1,020,000–2,220,000</td></tr></table>

Many firms consider the stresses and the costs worthwhile because listing brings numerous advantages besides raising fresh finance, including providing shareholders with a dynamic, transparent and liquid secondary market for trading shares, a raising of the company's status and visibility, and the possibility of mergers with other firms.

All companies obtaining a full MM listing must ensure that at least 25 per cent of their share capital is in public hands, so that the shares are capable of being traded actively on the market. The Indian markets adopted the same 25 per cent rule in 2010 - see Exhibit 9.2.

# Exhibit 9.2

# India flotation demand set to hit valuations

By Joe Leahy in Mumbai

The Indian government yesterday ordered listed companies to ensure that at least 25 per cent of their shares are publicly held within three years in a move that could hit the valuations of hundreds of businesses.

The measure, which increases the minimum public float from 10 per cent, could lead to shares worth Rs2,500bn (53bn) being sold over the next three years - more than the total that Indian companies have raised from equity issues in the past decade.

Leading companies that are expected to be forced to begin shedding stakes include Wipro, the third-largest outsourcing group.

"A dispersed shareholding structure is essential … to provide liquidity to the investors and to discover fair prices," the Indian finance ministry said in a statement.

Corporate governance activists have long argued that the low compulsory public float made it easier for the controlling shareholders of India's companies to manipulate stocks by buying and selling small volumes of shares.

Under the rules, the government said those listed companies that presently have less than 25 per cent of their stock in public hands must sell an additional 5 per cent of their shares a year until they reach the target.

# United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA)

The UKLA is responsible for approval of the prospectuses and admission to the Official List (most of these companies are on the Main Market of the LSE, although PLUS markets – see later – may also admit Official List companies). The UKLA maintains details of all listed companies and updates its list daily with additions, cancellations, suspensions and restorations. It also rigorously enforces a set of demanding rules regarding the conduct of the company and its officials in the years following the listing.

The UKLA usually insists that a company has a track record (in the form of accounting figures) stretching back at least three years. However, this requirement has been relaxed for scientific research-based companies and companies undertaking major capital projects. In the case of scientific research-based companies there is the requirement that they have been conducting their activity for three years even if no revenue was produced. Some major project companies, for example Eurotunnel, have been allowed to join the market despite an absence of a trading activity or a profit record. Companies can be admitted to the techMARK, part of the Official List, with only one year of accounts.

The first step in floating a company is to apply to the UKLA to be put on the Official List. The listing fee is £225, plus an annual fee, based on the market capitalisation of the company, of at least £3,700 rising to more than £1 million for capitalisation over £25,000 million.

# Financial advisers

# The sponsor

Experts are required to guide firms through the complexities of an official listing. The key adviser in a flotation is the sponsor. This may be an investment bank, stockbroker or other professional adviser, but must be on the UKLA's approved list of sponsors. Directors, particularly of small companies, often first seek advice from their existing professional advisers, for example accountants and lawyers. Sponsors have to be chosen with care as the relationship is likely to be one which continues long after the flotation. For large or particularly complex issues investment banks are employed, although experienced stockbrokers have been used. The UKLA requires sponsors to certify that a company has complied with all the regulatory requirements and to ensure that all necessary documentation is filed on time.

The sponsor (sometimes called the issuing house) will first examine the company and the aspirations of the management team to assess whether flotation is an appropriate corporate objective by taking into account its structure, strategy and capital needs. The sponsor will also comment on the composition of the board and the calibre of the directors. The sponsor may even recommend supplementation with additional directors if the existing team does not come up to the quality expected. Sponsors can be quite forceful in this because they do not want to damage their reputation by bringing a poorly managed company to market. The sponsor will draw up a timetable, which can be lengthy – sometimes the planning period for a successful flotation may extend over two years. Another important function is to help draft the prospectus and provide input to the marketing strategy. Throughout the process of flotation there will be many other professional advisers involved and it is vital that their activities mesh into a coherent whole. It is the sponsor's responsibility to coordinate the activities of all the other professional advisers.

# The corporate broker

When a corporate broker is employed as a sponsor the two roles can be combined. If the sponsor is, say, an investment bank, the UKLA requires that a broker is also appointed. However, most investment banks also have corporate broking arms and so can take on both roles. Brokers play a vital role in advising on share market conditions and the likely demand from investors for the company's shares. They also represent the company to investors to try to generate interest. When debating issues such as the method of share issue to be employed, the marketing strategy, the size of the issue, the timing or the pricing of the shares, the company may value the market knowledge the broker has to offer.

# Underwriters

Shortly before the flotation the sponsor will have the task of advising on the best price to ask for the shares, and, at the time of flotation, the sponsor will usually underwrite the issue. Most new issues are underwritten because the correct pricing of a new issue of shares is extremely difficult. If the price is set too high, demand will be less than supply and not all the shares will be taken up. The company is usually keen to know that it will receive the expected money from the issue so that it can plan ahead. To make sure it sells the shares it buys a kind of insurance called **underwriting**. In return for a fee the underwriter guarantees to buy the proportion of the issue not taken up by the market. An investment bank sponsoring the issue will usually charge a fee of 2-4 per cent of the issue proceeds and then pays part of that fee, say 1.25-3.0 per cent of the issue proceeds, to sub-underwriters (usually large financial institutions such as pension funds and banks), which each agree to buy a certain number of shares if called on to do so. In most cases the underwriters do not have to purchase any shares because the general public are keen to take them up. However, occasionally they receive a shock and have to buy large quantities.

# Legal expenses

All legal requirements in the flotation preparation and in the information displayed in the prospectus must be observed. Lawyers prepare the 'verification' questions which are used to confirm that every statement in the prospectus can be justified as fact. Directors bear the ultimate responsibility for the truthfulness of the documents. Examples of other legal issues are directors' contracts, changes to the articles of association, re-registering the company as a public limited company (rather than a limited company which is not able to offer its shares to the wider public), underwriting agreements and share option schemes.

# Accounting

The reporting accountant in a flotation has to be different from the company's existing auditors, but can be a separate team in the same firm.

The accountant will be asked by the sponsor to prepare a detailed report on the firm's financial controls, track record, financing and forecasts (the 'long form' report). Not all of this information will be included in the prospectus but it does serve to reassure the sponsor that the company is suitable for flotation. Accountants may also have a role in tax planning from both the company's viewpoint and that of its shareholders. They also investigate working capital requirements. The UKLA insists that companies show that they have enough working capital for current needs and for at least the next 12 months.

# Registrar

The record on the ownership of shares is maintained by registrars as shares are bought and sold. Registrars keep the company's register and issue share certificates. There are about two dozen major registrars linked up to CREST through which they are required to electronically adjust their records of ownership of company shares within two hours of a trade taking place.

# Listing fees

Listing fees are charged by stock markets for admission to listing, followed by annual charges, graduated according to the size of the company. See Exhibit 9.3 for LSE fees.

Exhibit 9.3 London Stock Exchange listing fees 2011

<table><tr><td>Main Market admission fees</td><td>£</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum (under £5m capitalisation)</td><td>6,708</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum (over £500m capitalisation)</td><td>388,173</td></tr><tr><td>Main Market annual fees</td><td>UK</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum (under £50m capitalisation)</td><td>4,410</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum (over £500m capitalisation)</td><td>43,470</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>International</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum (under £25m capitalisation)</td><td>6,773</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum (over £1,025m capitalisation)</td><td>21,634</td></tr><tr><td>AIM admission fees</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Minimum (under £5m capitalisation)</td><td>6,720</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum (over £250m capitalisation)</td><td>75,810</td></tr><tr><td>AIM annual fee</td><td>5,350</td></tr></table>

# Printing, advertising, public relations, etc.

Public relations and advertising companies are used to influence investors and persuade them to buy the shares. Although the shares are underwritten, and therefore there is a guarantee that they will all be sold, albeit maybe at a lower price than the offer price, it is a huge relief to all concerned if the public response is favourable and the shares are sold to investors. It demonstrates public confidence in the company and shows that the listing was justified, and the sponsors can gauge investor appetite accurately.

# Prospectus

To create a stable market and encourage investors to place their money with companies the UKLA tries to minimise the risk of investing by ensuring that the firms which obtain a quotation abide by high standards; this includes producing a well-crafted prospectus. The prospectus ('listing particulars') is designed to inform potential shareholders about the company. This may contain far more information about the firm than it has previously dared to put into the public domain. The prospectus acts as a marketing tool as the firm attempts to persuade investors to apply for shares.

The content and accuracy of this vital document are the responsibility of the directors. Contained within it must be three years of audited accounts, details of indebtedness and a statement as to the adequacy of working capital. Statements by experts are often required: valuers may be needed to confirm the current value of property, engineers may be needed to state the viability of processes or machinery and accountants may be needed to comment on the profit figures. All major contracts entered into in the past two years will have to be detailed and a description of the risks facing the firm provided. Any persons with a shareholding of more than 3 per cent have to be named. A mass of operational data is also required, ranging from an analysis of sales by geographical area and type of activity, to information on research and development and significant investments in other companies.

# Methods of issue

The sponsor will look at the motives for wanting a quotation, at the amount of money that is to be raised, at the history and reputation of the firm, and will then advise on the best method of issuing the shares. There are various methods, ranging from a full-scale offer for sale to a relatively simple introduction. The final choice often rests on the costs of issue, which can vary considerably. Here are the main options:

- Offer for sale The company sponsor offers shares to the public by inviting subscriptions from institutional and individual investors. Sometimes newspapers carry a notice and an application form. However, most investors will need to contact the sponsor or the broker to obtain an application form. Publications such as Investors Chronicle show the telephone numbers to call for each company floating. Also details of forthcoming fluctuations are available at www.london-stockexchange.com and www.hemscott.com. Normally the shares are offered at a fixed price determined by the company's directors and their financial advisers. A variation of this method is an offer for sale by tender. Here investors are invited to state a price at which they are willing to buy (above a minimum reserve price). The sponsor gathers the applications and then selects a price which will dispose of all the shares – the strike price. Investors bidding a price above this will be allocated shares at the strike price – not at the price of their bid. Those who bid below the strike price will not receive any shares. This method is useful in situations where it is very difficult to value a company, for instance where there is no comparable company already listed or where the level of demand may be difficult to assess.
- Introductions These do not raise any new money for the company. If the company's shares are already quoted on another stock exchange or there is a wide spread of shareholders, with more than 25 per cent of the shares in public hands, the Exchange permits a company to be 'introduced' to the market. This method may allow companies trading on AIM to move up to the Main Market or foreign corporations to gain a London listing. This is the cheapest method of flotation since there are no underwriting costs and relatively small advertising expenditures.
- Placing In a placing, shares are offered to the public but the term 'public' is narrowly defined. Instead of engaging in advertising to the population at large, the sponsor or broker handling the issue sells the shares to institutions it is in contact with, such as pension and insurance funds. The costs of this method are considerably lower than those of an offer for sale. There are lower publicity costs and legal costs. A drawback of this method is that the spread of shareholders is going to be more limited. To alleviate this problem the Stock Exchange insists on a large number of places holding shares after the new issue. A generation ago the most frequently used method of new issue was the offer for sale. This ensured a wide spread of share ownership and thus a more liquid secondary market. It also permitted all investors to participate in new issues. Placings were permitted only for small offerings (< £15m) when the costs of an offer for sale would have been prohibitive. Today any size of new issue can be placed. As this method is much cheaper and easier than an offer for sale, companies have naturally switched to placings so there are now few offers for sale. Placings are normally carried out by sponsors and brokers, but, as Exhibit 9.4 shows, companies can do their own.

# David Blackwell

Futuragene earlier this month carried out what could be described as a DIY placing. The company, a specialist in plant cell modification, did not involve its broker in the sales process.

"We found the investors," says Stanley Hirsch, chief executive, of himself and chairman Mark Pritchard. "We had the contacts and were able to move more rapidly - and we incurred no broker fees. As a result, the gross proceeds are almost completely net proceeds."

The board considered a general offer to existing shareholders through a rights or other pre-emptive issue to be inappropriate because of "the significant additional costs that would be incurred and the delay that would be caused by the production and approval of a prospectus".

Instead the company placed 6m shares at 50p each with several new shareholders raising  $£3\mathrm{m}$ . The placing brought in a substantial new shareholder - Hartford Growth (Trading) Fund, which now has a 5 per cent stake. The shares closed yesterday up  $\frac{3}{4}\mathrm{p}$  at  $70^{\frac{3}{4}}\mathrm{p}$ .

- Intermediaries offer A method which is often combined with a placing is an intermediaries offer. Here the shares are offered for sale to financial institutions such as stockbrokers. Clients of these intermediaries can then apply to buy shares from them.
- **Reverse takeover** Sometimes a larger unquoted company makes a deal with a smaller quoted company whereby the smaller company 'takes over' the larger firm by swapping newly created shares in itself for the shares in the unquoted firm currently held by its owners. Because the quoted firm creates and issues more new shares itself than it had to start with, the unquoted firm's shareholders end up with the majority of the shares in the newly merged entity. They therefore now control a quoted company. The only task remaining is to decide on a name for the company – frequently the name of the previously unquoted company is chosen. A reverse takeover is a way for a company to gain a listing/Quotation without the hassle of an official new issue.
- Book-building Selling new issues of shares through book-building is a popular technique in the US and is starting to catch on in Europe. Under this method the financial advisers to an issue contact major institutional investors to get from them bids for the shares over a period of 8–10 working days. The investors' orders are sorted according to price, quantity and other factors such as 'firmness' of bid (e.g. a 'strike bid' means the investor will buy a given number of shares within the initial price range, leaving it to others to set the price; a 'limit bid' means the investor would buy a particular quantity at a particular price). This data may then be used to establish a price for the issue and the allocation of shares.

Exhibit 9.5 shows share prices for five well-known companies since they floated on the Main Market. Each has been assisted by being on the London Stock Exchange but their performances are something of a mixed bag, with Burberry's share price zooming away, easyJet's going nowhere and Debenhams' declining. Burberry has experienced a surge in demand for its products worldwide (and thus its shares) as its fashion brand has caught on in many countries, particularly in Asia. easyJet has a constant battle in the highly competitive short-haul travel market and so has struggled to give a decent return to its shareholders. Debenhams was sold by private equity companies at a price thought to be too high, made worse by the recession. Halfords has developed a reputation for good management and so has ridden out the recession well, giving shareholders a good return. William Hill has suffered from the proliferation of competitors such as betting exchanges and online gambling.

# Case study 9.1 A flotation: Ocado

This case study will help explain the timetable for an IPO in the UK. The key date in an IPO is 'impact day' when the full prospectus is published and the price is announced in a fixed-price offer for sale or in a placing. In this example all the timings will be relative to impact day – which is 20 July 2010.

# Pre-launch publicity: 1-2 years before impact day

The company was formed in 2000 by Tim Steiner, Jason Gissing and Jonathan Faiman, all of them former Goldman Sachs employees. A partnership with the up-market grocer Waitrose was formed, giving Ocado exclusive rights to deliver internet-ordered Waitrose goods using a central warehouse and a fleet of trucks. It had raised £350 million from a range of investors including Procter & Gamble and Jorn Rausing, the Tetra Pak billionaire. The former investment bankers running the company were well aware of the need to drum up investment interest in the company long before the actual flotation, thus they would often give interviews to the press, glossing over the absence of profits and directing attention to the long-term potential of online grocery sales.

# Preparation to float: several weeks before impact day

In April 2010, three months before the float and nine years after Ocado started to operate as an unquoted company, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and UBS were appointed as joint sponsors, joint global-coordinators and joint bookrunners. Immediately, the talk was 'a possible £1 billion float this summer' despite the business never having produced a profit. If it achieved £1 billion the three founders would have shares worth £160 million. It had beefed up its board of directors in the previous month, announcing the appointment of David Grigson, former finance director of Reuters, and Ruth Anderson, former vice-chairman of KPMG in the UK, as non-executive directors. Michael Grade, a well-respected City figure, joined as chairman.

Ocado signed up a further five banks in the 'junior syndicate' – Barclays Capital, Lloyds, HSBC, Numis and Jefferies – to work alongside the sponsors on the IPO in an effort to really give the sale of the shares a push (they all have contacts and clients who might be persuaded to buy).

The sponsors and other advisers then worked on details such as drawing up an accountant's report, the price and method of issue, and organising underwriting. Between six weeks and one week before impact day the sponsors were required to show all the documents to the UKLA for approval.

In June, Ocado said that when the flotation happened about 500,000 of its customers would be given the opportunity to buy shares alongside the major buyers, the institutional funds. Retail investors were expected to buy only £20 - £50 million shares; the main offering was in a placing following a book-building process, where the shares are offered to institutional investors.

The company planned to raise around £200 million by selling new shares equivalent to about one-fifth of the total shares already in issue. In addition, the original backers of Ocado (particularly John Lewis pension fund with a 26.5 per cent stake and Steiner and Gissing) wanted to sell 155 million shares in the float, which worried many potential investors: why did the original investors want to get out if this company had such potential? And why was it so highly valued relative to, say, Tesco? And why did Steiner get £651,000 annually in salary and other benefits from a business that had never made a profit? Investors Chronicle commented:

This offer is not so much cash-and-carry as cash-in-and-scarper, with holders John Lewis and bookrunner UBS planning to dump £200 million of shares. The management team of former Goldman Sachs bankers are also entitled to offload shares worth as much as £19 million between them. (9 July 2010)

In the first week of July the sponsors were still confident that they could sell £200 million of new shares. They published the pathfinder prospectus on Tuesday 7 July and began a two-week roadshow in which they went around both Europe and the US giving presentations to institutional investors to entice them to buy. The price range they talked about (no final decision yet) was 200-275p, valuing the company at around £1 billion. The conversations at the roadshow would tell the sponsor how realistic this was.

Ocado floated its shares at a time when the stock market was experiencing an uncertain period. Other companies intending to float, such as Fairfield Energy (an off-shore oil company), Madame Tussauds (the waxworks museum) and New Look (a fashion chain), decided to postpone their listings and wait for better economic conditions.

# Impact day

Tuesday 20 July: the full prospectus was published and the price was announced at  $180\mathrm{p}$ , which was a long way short of its initial hoped-for price of  $275\mathrm{p}$ . Despite the best efforts of company officials, sponsors and supporters, there was insufficient interest in the shares at the suggested price range of between  $200\mathrm{p}$  and  $275\mathrm{p}$ . To ensure sufficient take-up of its offering it was forced to slash the price of its IPO to  $180\mathrm{p}$ . This reduction in price enabled the flotation to take place successfully. Steiner refused to sell any of his shares at this 'too cheap' price.

Following impact day investors applied to buy and send in payments. The company made its formal application for listing and admission to the Exchange.

# Admission to the Exchange

For an offer for sale there might be two weeks or so between impact day and admission to the Exchange and dealing starting. However, with an issue like Ocado using a book-building process and placing of shares with institutions the timetable can be cut short. It was trading on the MM on 21 July. Its retail customers largely shunned the issue after reading the sceptical reports in the press and comments from professional analysts. At the lower price there were enough institutions willing to buy the shares so they raised the required £200 million. But around half of the IPO shares were taken up by existing investors, which included Fidelity, and regulatory filings showed only one major new investor. The existing shareholders ended up selling only £155 million of their shares.

On the first day of trading the shares fell to 164p and they continued to fall for the next few months – see Exhibit 9.6.

By way of contrast, Jupiter, a fund management company, performed very well following its flotation on 21 June 2010. Although it floated at a price near the bottom of its stated range, it had a 2.5 times coverage of its order book (there were 2.5 more investors wishing to buy than shares available) – see Exhibits 9.7 and 9.8.

Shares in Jupiter Fund Management surged 15 per cent on their first day of trading.

Jupiter, a private equity-backed fund manager led by Edward Bonham Carter, yesterday formally returned to the public markets for the first time since 1995 after selling  $220\mathrm{m}$  of shares last week.

Shares in the asset manager jumped from 165p to  $190^{1} / _{2}\mathrm{p}$ , adding

$\S 116\mathrm{m}$  to its market value in the biggest first-day rise for a main market London listing since December 2007, according to Dealoric.

Companies and their advisers can be criticised for "leaving money on the table" when a listing jumps on the first day of trading.

Jupiter had sold the shares at a price of 165p, near the bottom of its 150p-to-210p stated range, but had covered its order book 2.5 times, people close to the listing said.

It had enough investor demand to sell its shares at a higher price, but had chosen a lower price to achieve "a high quality book", these people said.

# Post-listing obligations

The UKLA insists on certain 'continuing obligations' designed to protect or enlighten shareholders. One of these is that all price-sensitive information is given to the market as soon as possible and that there is 'full and accurate disclosure' to all investors at the same time. Information is price sensitive if it might influence the share price or the trading in the shares. Investors need to be sure that they are not disadvantaged by market distortions caused by some participants having the benefit of superior information. Public announcements will be required in a number of instances, for example: the development of major new products; the signing of major contracts; details of an acquisition; a sale of large assets; a change in directors or a decision to pay a dividend. The website www.investigate.co.uk shows all major announcements made by companies going back many years. The FSA hands out fines to companies which do not comply with the rules - see Exhibit 9.9.

Photo-Me International, the photo booth operator, has been fined 500,000 for failing to tell the market promptly that its effort to win a significant new contract had hit hurdles and that sales of minilabs were falling behind expectations.

The fine is the largest handed down by the Financial Services

Authority for failure to disclose market-moving inside information quickly enough.

The City regulator said in its final notice that the failure created a false market in Photo-Me shares for 44 days in early 2007.

The fine is part of a string of enforcement actions carried out by a newly aggressive FSA, which also announced yesterday that it had fined Vantage Capital, the inter-dealer broker, a record 700,000 for allowing an unapproved person to perform a key leadership function for four years.

Margaret Cole, the FSA's enforcement director, said the

# Exhibit 9.9 continued

Photo-Me action "demonstrates our commitment to enforcing the UK listing regime and ensuring clean, efficient and orderly markets".

Over the past two years, Woolworths, Wolfson Microelectronics and Entertainment Rights have all paid fines for failing to update the markets.

The FSA found that in late 2006, Photo-Me had led the market to believe it would win large sales contracts and "strong minilab sales". But the company then waited too long to announce it faced new competition for a contract with a US supermarket chain, and a director failed to open an e-mail with disappointing January sales information.

When Photo-Me finally issued a profit warning in March 2007, its shares dropped 24 per cent.

Listed companies are also required to provide detailed financial statements within six months of the year-end. Firms usually choose to make preliminary profit announcements based on unaudited results for the year a few weeks before the audited results are published. Interim reports for the first half of each accounting year are also required (within four months of the end of the half-year). The penalty for non-compliance is suspension from the Exchange.

# Share dealing by directors

There are strict rules concerning the buying and selling of the company's shares by its own directors once it is on the stock exchange. The Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Model Code for Director Dealings have to be followed. Directors are prevented from dealing for a minimum period (normally two months) prior to an announcement of regularly recurring information such as annual results. They are also forbidden to deal before the announcement of matters of an exceptional nature involving unpublished information which is potentially price sensitive. These rules apply to any employee in possession of such information. When directors do buy or sell shares in their company they are required to disclose these dealings publicly. Most (free) financial websites (e.g. www.advfn.com or www.iii.co.uk) show all major announcements made by companies going back many years, including director purchases and sales.

# UK Corporate Governance Code

There is a considerable range of legislation and other regulatory pressures designed to encourage directors to act in shareholders' interests. In the UK, the Companies Acts require certain minimum standards of behaviour, as does the LSE. For example, directors are forbidden to use their position to profit at the expense of shareholders. There is the back-up of the financial industry regulator, the FSA/FCA, and the Financial Reporting Council (FRC, an accounting body).

Following a number of financial scandals, guidelines of best practice in corporate governance were issued by the Cadbury, Greenbury, Hampel, Higgs and Smith committees, now consolidated in the UK Corporate Governance Code, which is backed by the FSA/FCA, the LSE and the FRC.

Under the code, directors of companies listed on the MM are required to state in the accounts how the principles of the code have been applied. If the principles have not been followed they have to state why. The principles include:

- The board should include a balance of executive and non-executive directors (and in particular independent non-executive directors) such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the board's decision taking. For large companies (the largest 350 on the LSE) at least half the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise non-executive directors determined by the board to be independent. The independent non-executive directors can act as a powerful counterweight to the executive directors. These directors are not full-time and not concerned with day-to-day management. They may be able to take a broader view than executive directors, who may become excessively focused on detail. The experienced individuals who become non-executive directors are not expected to be dependent on the director's fee for income and can therefore afford to be independently minded. They are expected to 'constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy … scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.'4
- There should be a balance of power on the board such that no one individual can dominate and impose their will. The running of the board of directors (by a chairman) should be a separate responsibility conducted by a person who is not also responsible for running the business, i.e. the chief executive officer (CEO) or managing director (MD) (this is frequently ignored in practice, which is permitted if a written justification is presented to shareholders).
- There should be transparency on directors' remuneration requiring a remuneration committee consisting exclusively of non-executive directors, independent of management. No director should be involved in deciding his or her remuneration. A significant proportion of remuneration should be linked to corporate and individual performance.
- The procedure for the appointment of board directors should be formal (nomination committee), objective (based on merit) and transparent (information on the terms and conditions made available). Directors are to retire by rotation at least every three years – they may be re-elected.
- The audit committee (responsible for validating financial figures, e.g. by appointing effective external auditors) should consist exclusively of independent non-executive directors, otherwise the committee would not be able to act as a check and balance to the executive directors.
- Directors are required to communicate with shareholders, e.g. to use the annual general meeting to explain the company's performance and encourage discussion.

The 'comply or explain' approach is in contrast to many other systems of regulation of corporate governance around the world – these are often strict rule-based systems with lawyers to the fore (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley regulations in the US). 'The flexibility it offers [the 'comply or explain' approach] has been widely welcomed both by company boards and by investors. It is for shareholders and others to evaluate the company's statement. While it is expected that companies will comply with the Code's provisions most of the time, it is recognised that departure from the provisions of the Code may be justified in particular circumstances' (FSA, 2003, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, some of the provisions do not apply to companies smaller than the largest 350 listed on the London Stock Exchange. However, failure to comply or explain properly will result in suspension from the stock exchange.

# The Alternative Investment Market (AIM)

There is a long-recognised need for equity capital by small, young companies which are unable to afford the costs of full listing. Many stock exchanges have alternative equity markets that set less stringent rules and regulations for joining or remaining quoted (often called 'second-tier markets').

Lightly regulated markets have a continuing dilemma. If the regulation is too lax, scandals of fraud or incompetence will arise, damaging the image and credibility of the market and thus reducing the flow of investor funds to companies. (This happened to the German market for small companies, Neuer Markt, which had to close in 2002 because of the loss in investor confidence.) If the market is too tightly regulated, with more company investigations, more information disclosure and a requirement for longer trading track records prior to flotation, the associated costs and inconvenience will deter many companies from seeking a quotation.

In the UK, there are many small young companies needing to raise equity capital but which are excluded from the MM because of the huge cost of obtaining and maintaining a listing. The AIM sets less stringent rules, regulations and costs for joining or remaining quoted.

The driving philosophy behind the AIM is to offer young and developing companies access to new sources of finance, while providing investors with the opportunity to buy and sell shares in a trading environment which is run, regulated and marketed by the LSE. Efforts are made to keep the costs down and make the rules as simple as possible. In contrast to the MM, there is no requirement for AIM companies to have been in business for a minimum three-year period or for a set proportion of their shares to be in public hands – if they wish to sell only 1 per cent or 5 per cent of the shares to outsiders, that is OK. They do not have to ensure that 25 per cent of the shares are in public hands. However, investors have some degree of reassurance about the quality of companies coming to the market. These firms have to appoint, and retain at all times, a nominated adviser and nominated broker. The nominated adviser, the nomad, is selected by the company from a Stock Exchange approved register, and must have demonstrated to the Exchange that they have sufficient experience and qualifications to act as a 'quality controller', confirming to the LSE that the company has complied with the rules. Unlike with MM companies there is no pre-vetting of admission documents by the UKLA or the Exchange, as a lot of weight is placed on the nomad's investigations and informed opinion about the company.

Nominated brokers have an important role to play in bringing together buyers and sellers of shares. Investors in the company are reassured that at least one broker is ready to help shareholders to trade. The adviser and broker are to be retained throughout the company's life on the AIM. They have high reputations and it is regarded as a very bad sign if either of them abruptly refuses further association with a firm.

AIM companies are also expected to comply with strict rules regarding the publication of price-sensitive information and the quality of annual and interim reports. Upon flotation, an AIM admission document is required. This is similar to a prospectus required for companies floating on the MM, but is not as comprehensive and therefore has a lower cost. The LSE charges companies an annual fee to maintain a quotation on AIM. If to this is added the cost of financial advisers and of management time spent communicating with institutions and investors, the annual cost of being quoted on AIM runs into tens of thousands of pounds. This can be a deterrent for many companies. The cost of an initial offering of shares runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The cost of joining AIM is around  $100,000 -$ 200,000, but if additional money is raised by selling new shares the organisation and underwriting costs push this up over  $500,000$  in many cases. Nominated advisers argue that their policing role on behalf of the LSE means they have to incur much higher investigatory costs than was envisaged when AIM was first established, thus they have higher ongoing as well as initial costs.

However, there are cost savings compared with the MM. As well as the flotation prospectus being less detailed and therefore cheaper, the annual expense of managing a quotation is less. For example, AIM companies are not bound by the Listing Rules administered by the UKLA but instead are subject to the AIM rules, written and administered by the LSE. AIM companies do not have to disclose as much information as companies on the Official List. Price-sensitive information will have to be published, but normally this will require only an electronic message from the adviser to the Exchange rather than a circular to shareholders.

Recently the LSE has tightened the rules on the quality assurance provided by nominated advisers, but this has raised costs for companies - see Exhibit 9.10.

Offsetting the cost advantages AIM has over the Official List is the fact that the higher level of regulation and related enhanced image, prestige and security of Official List companies means that equity capital can usually be raised at a lower required rate of return (the shares can be sold for more per unit of projected profit). However, as Exhibit 9.10 illustrates, AIM has pretty high standards of regulation anyway.

The AIM is not just a stepping-stone for companies planning to graduate to the Official List; it has many attractive features in its own right. Indeed, many Official List companies have moved to AIM in recent years.

# Tighter rules forcing nomads to run from smaller companies

# Brooke Masters

Fewer firms are serving as nominated advisers (nomads) to companies traded on London's junior market and many of those that remain are charging more for their services in the wake of last year's publication of the first-ever AIM rulebook and the first fines levied against a nomad.

The total number of nomads has fallen from 85 last February, when the rulebook was published, to 71. Some of the reduction is due to consolidation and tougher economic times, but the tighter rules helped drive away firms because they felt they could not make money while performing the record keeping and services required. Annual fees for ongoing nomad service to a  $50m company now run between$ 50,000 and 75,000 a year, double the fees charged by some firms last year.

Andrew Monk, chief executive of nomad Blue Oar, said: "It is now more responsibility to look after an AIM company than a fully listed company and they're more likely to be riskier because they are a smaller company. You have to charge more."

In a system invented by AIM, nomads serve as gate-keepers for London's junior market and are responsible for making sure the companies they advise adhere to the Stock Exchange's principles. The system is often lauded as more flexible and less costly for fledgling companies, but it has harsh critics who say it attracts companies with lower corporate governance standards.

While defending its approach, the London Stock Exchange has noticeably tightened up its rules and doubled the number of people assigned to AIM's regulatory and enforcement staff. The rulebook also ratcheted up the pressure on nomads by spelling out specific actions they could, and should, take. That has forced some to do more and others to improve their record keeping.

Nick Bayley, LSE's head of trading services, said: "It's harder now for a nominated adviser to argue it acted with due skill and care, if it has failed without good reason to do the things expected under the new nomad rules."

Some nomads welcome the more explicit standards, arguing they will reassure investors.

"Liquidity is key to making the market a success and part of liquidity is getting investors to trust the advisers to regulate what is going on," said Nick Stagg, chief executive of Landsbanki Securities (UK).

# PLUS

PLUS is a stock exchange based in London and is used by companies that do not want to pay the costs of a flotation on one of the markets run by the LSE. Companies quoted on PLUS provide a service to their shareholders, allowing them to buy and sell shares at reasonable cost. It also allows the company to gain access to capital, for example by selling more shares in a rights issue, without submitting to the rigour and expense of a quotation on the LSE. The downside is that trading in PLUS-quoted shares can be illiquid (not many buyers or sellers); bid-offer spreads vary widely with 30 per cent to 50 per cent not uncommon.

PLUS (originally called Ofex) was set up by the broker J. P. Jenkins in 1995 and is owned by PLUS-Markets group (www.plusmarketsgroup.com). Joining fees range from a minimum of £15,000 to £100,000 for the largest companies, and annual fees are between £5,665 and £50,500. In addition there are Corporate Adviser's fees of around £20,000, plus an annual retainer. If new money is to be raised there will be additional advisery and other costs. PLUS companies are generally small and often brand new, but there are also some long-established and well-known firms, such as Thwaites and Adnams.

Many companies gain a quotation on PLUS without raising fresh capital simply to allow a market price to be set and current shareholders to trade. If no money is raised, no formal admission document or prospectus is required, but the Corporate Adviser (to be retained by the company at all times) will insist that good accounting systems are in place with annual audited accounts and semi-annual accounts. The Corporate Adviser will also ensure that the company has at least one non-executive director and adequate working capital. In 2010 there were more than 200 companies with a combined market capitalisation of around £2 billion quoted on the PLUS exchange.

In addition to the 200 or so shares that are listed on the PLUS-quoted system, PLUS Market provides a trading platform for all UK listed shares, plus some European shares and some unlisted shares. PLUS itself is listed on the AIM market of the LSE, having raised £26 million for the expansion of its trading and quotation services in 2006.

# Micro-caps renew appetite for listings on Plus

Two companies raised money on joining Plus Markets at the end of last month, ending a dearth of initial public offerings on the third-tier market.

Climate Human Capital, a recruitment company specialising in the "green" sector, arrived on the market last Tuesday after raising  $\yen 750,000$  gross through a placing at  $50\mathrm{p}$  a share. At Thursday's closing price of  $55\mathrm{p}$ , the company had a market valuation of  $\yen 1.7\mathrm{m}$ .

If followed a week after Global Brands Licensing raised 1m through a placing at 1p a share. Shares in the company, which plans to create a Marilyn Monroe clothing range, closed on Thursday at 3^{1} / _{4}\mathrm{p} giving it a market capitalisation of \S 22.8\mathrm{m}.

There are also another half a dozen companies waiting to be introduced to Plus, signalling a renewed appetite among microcaps for a quote. Bioventix, which is developing anti-bodies for both commercial and research purposes, will join the market tomorrow.

Among others waiting in the wings is In House Group, a property company and refugee from Aim, which cancelled trading in its shares a month after Beaumont Cornish, its nominated adviser, resigned in December.

Climate Human Capital has been brought to market by WH Ireland, which has been a Plus adviser for 10 years but which represents only four companies on the market. The last company introduced by WH Ireland was China Meihua, a biotechnology company in which no shares have been traded since its arrival in August.

Katy Mitchell of WH Ireland said China Meihua had taken the quote in order to raise its profile and prove its corporate governance. Ms Mitchell said that Plus was working hard to improve its appeal to small companies at a time when it was difficult to raise funds.

Michael Brennan, chief executive of Climate Human Capital, said the company was too small to go to Aim. But joining Plus would give it "a certain profile" and help to attract investors, as well as allowing it to offer incentives to staff through share schemes.

The company raised its money from wealthy individuals and has enough to develop the company over the next 12 months. "If we do need to raise more, we can do so through existing investors," he said.

He claimed the company was the world's first quoted recruitment specialist centred on the "green" sector. It would be headhunting for activities as diverse as wind farms and non-governmental organisations.

After costs of about  $200,000, the net proceeds of the flotation were$ 550,000. "It is expensive - but we don't need to raise an enormous amount," he said. "We had to get what we needed to get the company going. Now we will grow it in an organic fashion."

# Indices

Information on individual companies in isolation is less useful than information set in the context of the firm's peer group, or in comparison with quoted companies generally. For example, if Tesco's shares fall by 1 per cent on a particular day, an investor might be keen to learn whether the market as a whole rose or fell on that day, and by how much. An index measures the relative value of a group of shares and publishes the data for comparison purposes.

The oldest index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which began in 1896 with 12 stocks (only one of which, General Electric, is still on the index) valued at 40.74. The number of companies was increased to 30 in 1928 valued at 239, since when the number of stocks has remained the same, but the index is now valued at over 10,000 - see Exhibit 9.13.

The companies on the Dow represent the largest and best-known US companies (see Exhibit 9.14) and the DJIA is one of the few indices to be weighted by the share price, so higher priced shares are given more weight – they may be smaller companies in terms of market capitalisation than others in the index but their percentage share price changes have more effect on the index. In recent years the S&P500 (Standard & Poor's 500) index has been given more attention than the DJIA because it more accurately represents the US market given that it contains 500 companies (and is market capitalisation weighted – see below).

Most indices are capitalisation weighted. To calculate these indices each component share is weighted by the size of the company; by its market capitalisation. Thus, a 2 per cent movement in the share price of a large company has a greater effect on an index than a 2 per cent change in a small company's share price.

The oldest UK index is the FTSE All Share index, formed in 1962 with a base value of 100, comprising all companies on the London Stock Exchange above a certain size and liquidity. Since then the FTSE (a joint venture of the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange) has produced an increasing number of indices, the most famous of which is the FTSE 100, the 'Footsie', which began in 1984 with a base value of 1000. It is an index of the 100 most highly capitalised UK-based 'blue chip' companies, which generally have a market capitalisation over £2 billion (large and relatively safe companies are referred to as 'blue chips'). Twenty-one of the original companies are still on the list, and its performance is closely watched by investors throughout the

The next FTSE 100 shake-up will give it an increasingly international look, writes Adam Jones

The FTSE 100 is poised for a fresh bout of internationalisation that will make it even less of a weathervane for the British economy.

Next week's quarterly review of the UK's most famous share index is almost certain to lead to the inclusion of Essar Energy, the Indian power, oil and gas group that floated in London in April.

Companies with a chance of entering with Essar include African Barrick Gold, a spin-off from Barrick Gold of Canada, which is the largest gold producer in Tanzania, and Petropavlosk, the

Russian gold miner formerly known as Peter Hambro Mining.

Meanwhile, candidates for possible relegation in the June 9 review include Thomas Cook and the London Stock Exchange, according to Winterflood Securities.

Broadly speaking, the FTSE 100 is a roll-call of the top 100 UK-listed companies by market capitalisation, although some other criteria apply.

Miners have led the charge. The likes of the Kazakhstan-focused Kazakhmys, Vedanta Resources (operates in India, Zambia and Australia) and Fresnillo (based in

Mexico) now stand shoulder to shoulder with UK-centric blue chips such as Marks & Spencer. David Hobbs, a director of FTSE, the body that compiles the index, says it is wrong to view their arrival as a rupture with the past, however.

"The FTSE 100 has never been and was never intended to be a representation of the UK economy," he says, pointing out that constituent companies have always drawn much of their turnover from overseas.

Corporate nationality can be hard to pin down in any case. British Airways for instance, will be part

# Exhibit 9.15 continued of a new company incorporated in Spain after it merges with Iberia.

Mr Hobbs and his colleagues recently had to decide if shares in this new entity could still be part of the FTSE 100. They provisionally decided that it could because of 'investor perception' and a likely London bias to post-merger trading.

A thumbs-down from FTSE, which is owned by the Financial Times Group and the LSE, would have been a blow to BA as there is still an international marketing cachet to being a part of the FTSE 100.

"It's a recognition," says Anil Agarwal, the controlling shareholder and executive chairman of Vedanta, which listed in London in 2003 and entered the FTSE 100 in 2006.

Membership of the index also means that some institutional investors are obliged to hold a company's shares. This can be controversial, given that the newcomers are sometimes deemed to be riskier bets.

Richard Lambert, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, thinks the influx from overseas had not left UK-focused businesses starved of capital, however.

UK plcs raised an enormous amount of equity last year," he says.

Many international companies are drawn to listing in London because of the depth of the pool of investors. An extra attraction for foreign businesses is the relatively flexible approach to corporate governance.

In the case of the miners, immigration has also become self-reinforcing. As the more mining groups listed, the more the City deepened its sector-specific expertise - such as specialist analysts and bankers - which in turn pulled in more businesses.

Some overseas-focused FTSE 100 members may have only a token UK office. But they have still been a substantial source of fees to local bankers, lawyers, accountants, public relations firms and company secretarial services.

Shallow local roots can also deepen into a substantial presence, as proved by SABMiller. The brewer, then South African Breweries, listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.

It now employs about 30-40 at its London head office and about 480 in the UK overall. But Graham Mackay, chief executive, recalls a very different set-up initially: "When we first came to list it was three of us and a filing cabinet."

FTSE All-Share This index is the most representative in that it reflects the average movements of over 600 shares comprising 98–99 per cent of the value of the London market. This index is broken down into a number of industrial and commercial sectors, so that investors and companies can use sector-specific yardsticks, such as those for mining or chemicals – see Exhibit 9.18. Companies in the FTSE All-Share index have market capitalisations (roughly) above £40 million.

FTSE 250 This index is based on 250 firms which are in the next size range after the top 100. Capitalisations are generally between £300 million and £2 billion. (Also calculated with investment trusts removed.)

FTSE 350 This index is based on the largest 350 quoted companies. It combines the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250. This cohort of shares is also split into two to give high and low dividend yield groups. A second 350 index excludes investment trusts.

FTSE SmallCap This index covers companies (268 of them in March 2011) included in the FTSE All-Share but excluded from the FTSE 350, with a market capitalisation of about £40m-£300 million.

FTSE Fledgling This includes companies listed on the MM but too small to be in the FTSE All-Share index.

FTSE AIM All-Share This is an index of all AIM companies (except those with a low free float and low liquidity).

FTSE All-Small This combines companies in the FTSE SmallCap with those in the FTSE Fledgling (419 companies in March 2011).

These indices are shown daily in the Financial Times - see Exhibit 9.18.

# Rights issues

In addition to, or as an alternative to, floating on a stock market, which usually involves raising finance by selling shares to a new group of shareholders, a company may raise finance by making a rights issue, in which existing shareholders are invited to pay for new shares in proportion to their present holdings.

This is a very popular method of raising new funds, especially if the company does not want or is unable to finance through borrowing. It is easy and relatively cheap (compared with new issues). Directors are not required to seek the prior consent of shareholders, and the London Stock Exchange will intervene in larger issues only (to adjust the timing so that the market does not suffer from too many issues in one period).

# Pre-emption rights

The UK has particularly strong traditions and laws concerning pre-emption rights. These require that a company raising new equity capital by selling shares must first offer those shares to the existing shareholders. The owners of the company are entitled to subscribe for the new shares in proportion to their existing holding, which enables them to maintain the influence of their existing percentage ownership of the company – the only difference is that each slice of the company cake is bigger because it is part of a larger financial asset. The importance of pre-emption rights across Europe and much of the rest of the world is discussed in Exhibit 9.19.

Rights issues are usually offered at a significantly discounted price from the market value of the current shares – typically 10–20 per cent. Shareholders can either buy these shares themselves or sell the 'right' to buy them to another investor. For further reassurance that the firm will raise the anticipated finance, rights issues are usually underwritten by financial institutions (the financial institution guarantees to buy any shares not sold).

# Knowing your rights is a serious issue

Ask shareholders which rights they treasure most highly and many say it is their right to pre-emption, which protects their holdings from being diluted by new share issues.

Many countries impose rules on share issues, forcing companies to tell existing shareholders of their plans or give existing shareholders the right of first refusal of new shares.

Last year 1,012 companies across the world raised 196.3bn via rights issues, according to Dealoric, the data provider. Three-quarters of this sum was raised in Europe.

Just over 100 UK companies raised  $65.2bn in 2009 and 245 continental European companies$ 82.8bn, says Dealoric. This accounts for about two-thirds of all cash calls in the region.

But few shareholders elsewhere take these rights more seriously than those in the UK, where protections have developed over centuries to stop managers transferring wealth from the owners of companies to new investors.

Market historians have found references to rights issues in the UK in 1719 and they were going strong by 1900 and pre-emption is now enshrined in UK company law.

The UK system stands out in two ways. UK investors' rights are separately valued and even shareholders who do not take up their entitlements to new shares are paid something for their rights.

Second, the system is designed to treat all shareholders equally. The Association of British Insurers, which is responsible for the government-backed guidelines on rights issues, distinguishes between rights issues found in many parts of the world and fully pre-emptive rights issues in the UK, which give existing shareholders first refusal of new shares.

The UK imposes some of the toughest constraints on companies raising funds. There are, for example, restrictions on how deeply new issues are discounted as well as a 5 per cent limit on "disapplication" - the amount of shares a company can sell without talking to shareholders.

Evidence of just how jealousy British shareholders guard their rights to participate equally in share issues came last year with the brouhaha over Rio Tinto's attempt to raise 19.5bn via a deal with Chinalco.

Investors were furious at the deal, which would have doubled the Chinese state-owned aluminium company's stake in Rio to 18 per cent at what investors said was an over-generous price. Rio was forced instead to opt for a 15.2bn rights issue and a joint venture with rival BHP Billiton.

As Legal & General Investment Management - the UK's largest investor - stiffly reminded the board at the time: "Shareholder preemption rights are paramount".

"Pre-emption is an article of faith in the UK," says Daniel Epstein, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.

It contrasts sharply with the US, where pre-emption was restricted by state legislation in 1930 and does not feature in the company law of Delaware, where most US companies are incorporated.

In the US, managements can sell what they want to the highest bidder and investors have limited protection from their actions.

Elsewhere round the world from Canada to Egypt and Australia, some form of pre-emption exists but the procedures and levels of protection differ.

In Egypt, say lawyers, companies can fulfil their obligations to investors by informing them of an issue in a local newspaper. Investors do not have tradeable rights. "There is an enti tlement understood as a right but there is no mechanism for monetising it," says Mr Epstein.

Even in Europe, pre-emption varies. The concept has been enshrined in European law since the 1970s. But as Paul Myners, now City minister, said in a 2004 government-sponsored report, the provisions in the 2nd Company Law Directive "are relatively permissive and hence there is some variation between the regimes in different Member states".

In the UK, regulators and shareholders argue that tight rules on pre-emption give investors confidence, which helps companies to raise capital at a lower cost, compared with share issues elsewhere.

Placing shares in the US costs an average of 5 per cent or more, compared with 3 or 4 per cent in the UK.

US bankers say they charge more because the market includes more private investors with small holdings - marketing to a diverse shareholder base costs more than to big investment groups based in one or two cities.

That said, the UK's rights issue process has not gone unchallenged. US bankers have long complained that the system is protracted and the requirement to send out wads of documents ahead of a shareholder vote and then give investors time to trade their rights introduces risk.

The pre-emption concept is gaining ground in other jurisdictions. In Japan, pre-emption rights issues were almost unknown. But as struggling companies last year found they needed to raise equity in more flexible ways, calls for share issues that protect shareholder rights have gained support, from the Tokyo stock exchange, among others.

# An example

Take the case of the imaginary listed company Swell plc with 100 million shares in issue. It wants to raise £25 million for expansion but does not want to borrow the money. Its existing shares are quoted on the stock market at  $120\mathrm{p}$ , so the new rights shares will have to be issued at a lower price to appeal to shareholders because there is a risk of the market price falling in the period between the announcement and the purchasing of new shares. The offer must remain open for shareholders to get their applications in for at least two weeks (ten working days).

Swell has decided to issue 25 million shares at 100p each, raising the required £25 million, thus the ratio of new shares to old is 25:100, a 'one-for-four' rights issue. Each shareholder will be offered one new share for every four already held. The discount on these new shares is 20p or 16.7 per cent.

If the market price before the issue is 120p, valuing the entire company at £120 million and another £25 million is pumped into the company by selling 25 million shares at £1, it logically follows that the market price after the rights issue cannot remain at 120p (assuming all else equal). A company that was previously valued at £120 million which then adds £25 million of value to itself (in the form of cash) should be worth £145 million. This company now has 125 million shares, therefore each share is worth £1.16 (i.e. £145 million divided by 125 million shares).

An alternative way of calculating the ex-rights price is as follows:

# Ex-rights price

<table><tr><td>Four existing shares at a price of 120p</td><td></td><td>480p</td></tr><tr><td>One new share for cash at 100p</td><td>+</td><td>100p</td></tr><tr><td>Value of five shares</td><td>=</td><td>580p</td></tr><tr><td>Value of one share ex-rights 580p/5</td><td></td><td>116p</td></tr></table>

Shareholders have experienced a decline in the price of their old shares from 120p to 116p. A fall of this magnitude necessarily follows from the introduction of new shares at a discounted price. However, the loss is exactly offset by the gain in share value on the new rights issue shares, which were issued at 100p but have a market price of 116p. This can be illustrated through the example of Sid, who owned 100 shares worth £120 prior to the rights announcement. Sid loses £4 on the old shares – their value is now £116. However, he makes a gain of £4 on the new shares:

<table><tr><td>Cost of rights shares (25 × £1)</td><td>£25</td></tr><tr><td>Ex-rights value (25 × £1.16)</td><td>£29</td></tr><tr><td>Gain</td><td>£4</td></tr></table>

When the press talks glibly of a rights offer being 'very attractively priced for shareholders', they are generally talking nonsense. Whatever the size of the discount, the same value will be removed from the old shares to leave the shareholder no worse or better off. Logically, value cannot be handed over to the shareholders from the size of the discount decision. Shareholders own all the company's shares before and after the rights issue – they can't hand value to themselves without also taking value from themselves. Of course, if the prospects for the company's profits rise because it can now make capital expenditures, leading to dominant market positions, then the value of shares will rise – for both the old and the new shares. But this is value creation that has nothing to do with the level of the discount.

# What if a shareholder does not want to take up the rights?

As owners of the firm all shareholders must be treated in the same way. To make sure that shareholders do not lose out because they are unwilling or unable to buy more shares the law requires that shareholders have a third choice, other than to buy or not buy the new shares. This is to sell the rights on to someone else on the stock market (selling the rights nil paid). Indeed, so deeply enshrined are pre-emption rights that even if the shareholder does nothing the company will sell his rights to the new shares on his behalf and send the proceeds to him. Thus, the shareholder is compensated for the fact that their shareholding has been diluted by the increased number of shares in issue.

Take the case of the impoverished Sid, who is unable to find the necessary  $£25$ . He could sell the rights to subscribe for the shares to another investor and not have to go through the process of taking up any of the shares himself. Thus, Sid would benefit to the extent of 16p per share or a total of  $\pounds 4$  (if the market price stays constant), which adequately compensates for the loss on the 100 shares he holds. But the extent of his control over the company has been reduced - his percentage share of the votes has decreased.

The value of a right on one old share in Swell is this theoretical market value of a share ex-rights less the subscription price divided by the number of old shares required to purchase one new share:

$$
\frac {1 1 6 \mathrm {p} - 1 0 0 \mathrm {p}}{4} = 4 \mathrm {p}
$$

In the case of the Lloyds issue (see Exhibit 9.20) those shareholders who did not take up the new shares received  $18.5\mathrm{p}$  for each share declined.

# By Sharlene Goff

Lloyds Banking Group has announced strong demand for its 13.5bn rights issue, with 95 per cent of investors taking up their new shares.

The bank said it had received acceptances for  $34.7\mathrm{m}$  shares, leaving a "rump" of  $1.7\mathrm{m}$ . The shares were placed in the market yesterday at a price of  $55.5\mathrm{p}$  a share, a premium of  $18.5\mathrm{p}$  to the  $37\mathrm{p}$  issue price.

The take-up was at the high end of analysts' expectations, particularly given that Lloyds has about  $2.8\mathrm{m}$  small shareholders, one of the largest bases of private investors in the UK.

Investors were offered 1.34 new shares for each existing one they owned at  $37\mathrm{p}$  per share. Lloyds,

43 per cent-owned by the government, has raised a total of  $23.5bn,$ 1bn more than thought, as it launched a larger-than-expected debt swap of 10bn in addition to the rights issue.

Eric Daniels, chief executive, yesterday thanked shareholders for "their considerable support" for the capital raising. "Our focus remains on delivering on our plans to become the UK's leading financial services company, which we believe will result in significant benefits for all our shareholders," he said.

Lloyds' share price fell 1p - or 1.9 per cent - yesterday to close at 55.2p. The shares have fallen about 5 per cent since the rights issue was announced last month.

Shareholders who did not take up their rights will receive a cheque for 18.5p a share, the difference between the issue price and the placement price of the unwanted shares.

Lloyds said investors who did accept the new shares would receive formal share certificates by December 29.

A number of institutional investors divided the "rump" of remaining shares. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS were lead underwriters on the rights issue.

# Ex-rights and cum-rights

Old shares bought in the stock market which are designated cum-rights carry with them to the new owner the right to subscribe for the new shares in the rights issue. After a cut-off date the shares go ex-rights, which means that any purchaser of old shares will not have the right to the new shares; that right remains with the former shareholder.

# Discounts

It does not matter greatly whether Swell raises £25 million on a one-for-four basis at 100p or on a one-for-three basis at 75p per share, or on some other basis (see Exhibit 9.21).

Exhibit 9.21 Comparison of different rights bases

<table><tr><td>Rights basis</td><td>Number of new shares (m)</td><td>Price of new shares (p)</td><td>Total raised (£m)</td></tr><tr><td>1 for 4</td><td>25</td><td>100</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>1 for 3</td><td>33.3</td><td>75</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>1 for 2</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>1 for 1</td><td>100</td><td>25</td><td>25</td></tr></table>

Whatever the basis of the rights issue, the company will receive £25 million and shareholders will see the price of their old shares decrease, but this will be exactly offset by the value of the rights on the new shares. However, the ex-rights price changes according to the basis of the rights issue – see Exhibit 9.22.

Exhibit 9.22 Ex-rights prices for different rights issue bases

<table><tr><td>Original shares</td><td></td><td>New shares</td><td></td><td></td><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td>Ex-rights price</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4 shares @ 120p</td><td>480p</td><td>1 share @ 100p</td><td>+</td><td>100p</td><td>Value of 5 shares</td><td>=</td><td>580p</td><td>Value of 1 share (580/5)</td><td>116p</td></tr><tr><td>3 shares @ 120p</td><td>360p</td><td>1 share @ 75p</td><td>+</td><td>75p</td><td>Value of 4 shares</td><td>=</td><td>435p</td><td>Value of 1 share (435/4)</td><td>108.75p</td></tr><tr><td>2 shares @ 120p</td><td>240p</td><td>1 share @ 50p</td><td>+</td><td>50p</td><td>Value of 3 shares</td><td>=</td><td>290p</td><td>Value of 1 share 290/3)</td><td>96.67p</td></tr><tr><td>1 share @ 120p</td><td>120p</td><td>1 share @ 25p</td><td>+</td><td>25p</td><td>Value of 2 shares</td><td>=</td><td>145p</td><td>Value of 1 share (145/2)</td><td>72.5p</td></tr></table>

If Swell chose the one-for-one basis this would be regarded as a deep-discounted rights issue. With an issue of this sort there is only a minute probability that the market price will fall below the rights offer price and therefore there is almost complete certainty that the offer will be taken up. It seems reasonable to suggest that the underwriting service provided by the institutions is largely redundant here and that the firm can make a significant saving. Yet a large majority of all rights issues are underwritten, usually involving between 100 and 400 sub-underwriters, with fees for all the professionals involved.

# Placings, open offers and clawback

Some companies argue that the lengthy procedures and expense associated with rights issues (e.g. the time and trouble it takes to get a prospectus prepared and approved by the UKLA) frustrate directors' efforts to take advantage of opportunities in a timely fashion. Firms in the US have much more freedom to bypass pre-emption rights. They are able to sell blocks of shares to securities houses for distribution elsewhere in the market. This is fast and has low transaction costs. If this were permitted in the UK there would be a concern for existing shareholders: they could experience a dilution of their voting power and/or the shares could be sold at such a low price that a portion of the firm is handed over to new shareholders too cheaply. The UK authorities have produced a compromise, under which firms must obtain shareholders' approval through a special resolution (a majority of 75 per cent of those voting) at the company's annual general meeting, or at an extraordinary general meeting to waive the pre-emption right. Even then the shares must not be sold to outside investors at more than a 5 per cent or 10 per cent discount to the share price. While the maximum discount for MM companies under the listing rules is 10 per cent, the Association of British Insurers' guidelines are for a maximum of 5 per cent. This is an important condition. It does not make any difference to existing shareholders if new shares are offered at a deep discount to the market price as long as they are offered to them. If external investors get a discount there is a transfer of value from the current shareholders to the new.

In placings, new shares of companies already listed are sold directly to a narrow group of external investors. The institutions, as existing shareholders, have produced guidelines to prevent abuse, which normally allow a placing of only a small proportion of the company's capital (a maximum of 5 per cent in a single year, and no more than 7.5 per cent is to be added to the company's equity capital over a rolling three-year period) in the absence of a clawback. Under clawback, existing shareholders have the right to reclaim the shares as though they were entitled to them under a rights issue. They can buy them at the price they were offered to the external investors. With a clawback the issue becomes an 'open offer'. Under an open offer companies can increase their share capital by between 15 per cent and 18 per cent. Beyond that the investors (e.g. Association of British Insurers) prefer a rights issue. The major difference compared with a rights issue is that if they do not exercise this clawback right they receive no compensation for any reduction in the price of their existing shares – there are no nil-paid rights to sell.

# Vendor placing

If a company wishes to pay for an asset such as a subsidiary of another firm or an entire company with newly issued shares, but the vendor does not want to hold the shares, the purchaser could arrange for the new shares to be bought by institutional investors for cash. In this way the buyer gets the asset, the vendor (e.g. shareholders in the target company in a merger or takeover) receive cash and the institutional investor makes an investment. There is usually a clawback arrangement for a vendor placing (if the issue is more than 10 per cent of market capitalisation of the acquirer). Again, the price discount can be no more than 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the current share price.

# Bought deal

Instead of selling shares to investors, companies are sometimes able to make an arrangement with a securities house whereby it buys all the shares being offered for cash. The securities house then sells the shares on to investors included in its distribution network, hoping to make a profit on the deal. Securities houses often compete to buy a package of shares from the company, with the highest bidder winning. The securities houses take the risk of being unable to sell the shares for at least the amount that they paid. Bought deals are limited by the 5 per cent or 10 per cent preemption rules.

# Scrip issues, scrip dividends, splits and consolidation

Scrip issues do not raise new money: a company simply gives all shareholders more shares in proportion to their existing holdings. The value of each shareholding does not change because the share price drops in proportion to the additional shares. They are also known as capitalisation issues or bonus issues. The purpose is to make shares more attractive by bringing down the price. British investors are thought to consider a share price of £10 and above as less attractive than one in single figures. So a company with shares trading at £15 on the market might distribute two 'free' shares for every one held – a two-for-one scrip issue. Since the amount of money in the firm and its economic potential are constant, the share price will theoretically fall to £5. Scrip issues are often regarded as indicating confidence in future earnings increases. If this new optimism is expressed in the share price it may not fall as much as theory would suggest. However, many people are sceptical about the benefits of scripts, especially in light of the transaction costs.

A number of companies have an annual scrip issue while maintaining a constant dividend per share, effectively raising the level of profit distribution. For example, if a company pays a regular dividend of 20p per share but also has a one-for-ten scrip, the annual income will go up by 10 per cent. (A holder of 10 shares who previously received 200p now receives 220p on a holding of 11 shares.)

Scrip dividends are slightly different: shareholders are offered a choice between receiving a cash dividend and receiving additional shares. This is more like a rights issue because the shareholders are making a cash sacrifice if they accept the scrip shares. Shareholders are able to add to their holding without paying a stockbroker's commission. Companies are able to raise additional equity capital without the expense of a rights issue.

A 'share split' (stock split) means that the nominal value of each share is reduced in proportion to the increase in the number of shares, so the total book value of shares remains the same. So, for example, a company may have 1 million shares in issue with a nominal value of  $50\mathrm{p}$  each. It issues a further 1 million shares to existing shareholders with the nominal value of each share reducing to  $25\mathrm{p}$ , but total nominal value remains at  $\mathbb{£}500,000$ . Of course, the share price will halve – assuming all else is constant.

If the share price goes too low, say 15p, companies may decide to pursue consolidation of shares. This is the opposite of a split: the number of shares is reduced and the nominal value of each remaining share rises. If the nominal (par) value is 5p the company could consolidate on the basis of five shares for one. A 25p nominal share would replace five 5p nominal shares and the new share would then trade in the market at  $5 \times 15\mathrm{p} = 75\mathrm{p}$  (or slightly more if investors are more attracted to shares within a 'normal' price range).

# Share buy-backs and special dividends

Occasionally directors conclude that the company has too much equity capital and that it would be appropriate to hand back some of the cash to shareholders. It could be that the company is able to generate higher returns on each remaining share by borrowing more to reduce the number of shares by self-purchase. It could be that the directors think the shares are undervalued, and by reducing the quantity on the market the price will rise. It could be that the directors are aware of the tendency of companies to squander surplus cash on value-destroying mergers, and they want to avoid the temptation.

Buy-backs may also be a useful alternative when the company is unsure about the sustainability of a possible increase in the normal cash dividend. A stable policy may be pursued on dividends, and then shares are repurchased as and when surplus cash is available. This two-track approach avoids sending an over-optimistic signal about future growth through changing underlying dividend levels.

It is necessary for companies to ask shareholders' permission to buy back shares. Many companies now regularly vote at AGMs to allow buy-backs of up to 10 per cent of share capital in the following 12 months. The directors then have the freedom to choose when, and if, they will buy in shares.

A second possible approach to returning surplus funds is to pay a special dividend. This is the same as the normal dividend, but bigger and paid on a one-off basis.

# Warrants

Warrants give the holder the right to subscribe for a specified number of shares at a fixed price during or at the end of a specified time period. If a company has shares currently trading at £3 it might choose to sell warrants, each of which grants the holder the right to buy a share in the company at, say, £4 over the next five years. If by the fifth year the share price has risen to £6 the warrant holders could exercise their rights and then sell the shares immediately, gaining £2 per share, which is likely to be a considerable return on the original warrant price of a few pence. Warrants are frequently attached to bonds, and make the bond more attractive because the investor benefits from a relatively safe (but low) income on the bond if the firm performs in a mediocre fashion, but if the firm does very well and the share price rises significantly the investor will participate in some of the extra returns through the 'sweetener' or 'equity kicker' provided by the warrant.

There is no requirement for investors to hold warrants until exercised or they expire. There is an active secondary market on the London Stock Exchange.

# Concluding comments

Raising money for a company by selling shares is a complicated business. There are so many factors to be properly coordinated. There are numerous legal issues, regulations to be observed, the marketing of the shares to potential investors and the underwriting process to organise, to name but a few. It may seem that the financial institutions guiding firms earn outlandish fees, but it must be admitted that they do provide considerable social benefit.

# Key points and concepts
- London Stock Exchange's Main Market is the most heavily regulated UK exchange.
- The Alternative Investment Market (AIM) is the lightly regulated exchange designed for small, young companies.
$\bullet$  PLUS provides a share trading facility for companies, less costly than the LSE.
- Go public means to issue and trade shares on a stock market for the first time.
- Joining the Main Market of the LSE involves two stages. The securities (usually shares) have to be: (a) admitted to the Official List by the UKLA; and also (b) admitted by the Exchange for trading.
- UKLA (UK Listing Authority) is part of the Financial Services Authority/Financial Conduct Authority and maintains the Official List of companies eligible to be traded on the most highly regulated exchanges.
- Cost of floating on the Main Market is high, between £1m and £2m for a company issuing £20m shares.
- All companies wishing to list on MM must ensure that at least 25 per cent of share capital is in public hands, and must have at least three years of accounting figures (except for TechMARK companies, and companies undertaking exceptional activities).
Financial expenses involved in flotation:
- Sponsor: must be approved by UKLA; may be individual or a bank; guides a company through the process.

Corporate broker: may be same as sponsor; advises on price, demand and marketing.

- Underwriter: guarantees to buy shares if they are not sold.
- Legal advisers: fulfill legal requirements.
- Accounting advisers: prepare detailed report on a company's finances and advise on tax implications.
- Registers maintain records of these companies and are linked to CREST.
Listing fees: set by the MM or AIM; vary according to the size of a company.
- Printing, advertising, public relations: to encourage investment.
Prospectus: detailed document designed to attract investment.

# Different types of flotation are: offer for sale: shares offered to general market, at a fixed price or by tender.
- introduction: no new money is raised.
- placing: shares are placed with institutional investors.
- intermediaries offer: shares are offered for sale to financial institutions such as stockbrokers. Clients of these intermediaries can then apply to buy shares from them.
- reverse takeover: a larger unquoted company makes a deal with a smaller quoted company whereby the smaller company 'takes over' the larger firm by swapping newly created shares in itself for the shares in the unquoted firm currently held by its owners.
book-building: financial advisers to an issue contact major institutional investors to get from them bids for the shares over a period.

# Stages in a flotation are: pre-launch publicity;

deciding technicalities, e.g. method, price, underwriting;

- pathfinder prospectus; advisers and company executives usually undertake a roadshow to sell the shares;
- launch of public offer - prospectus and price on impact day;
- close of offer;
- allotment of shares;
- announcement of price and first trading.

# Post-listing obligations are:
- disclosure of price-sensitive information;
- regular financial reports;
- limits on director share dealing;
UK Corporate Governance Code to be observed.
- To float on AIM the companies do not have to allow a free float of 25 per cent of the shares, nor have a three-year trading history. There are lower joining costs and ongoing costs than for Main Market.
- Nomad (nominated adviser) must be appointed by companies wishing to become quoted on AIM.
- Nomad must be on approved register; acts as quality controller of company.

Nominated broker advises on share market and brings together buyers and sellers of shares.

To float on AIM companies must meet LSE rules and provide admission document.

- Admission and annual fees: charged by all exchanges; charges are less on AIM than on MM.

The higher level of regulation and related enhanced image, prestige and security of Official List companies means that equity capital can usually be raised at a lower required rate of return.

# Analyst's ratios:

PER (price-earnings ratio) is share price divided by earnings per share:

Share price Earnings per share

Dividend yield:

$$
\frac {\text {D i v i d e n d p e r s h a r e}}{\text {S h a r e p r i c e}} \times 1 0 0
$$

Dividend cover:

Earnings per share Dividend per share

Market capitalisation: is the number of shares in issue multiplied by the share price.

Ex-dividend date is the date after which new buyers will not receive recent dividend.

- Indices give the relative performance information of a chosen group of shares.
- DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) is the oldest share index and is weighted by share price.
S&P 500 represents the US market better than the DJIA because it contains 500 US shares and is market capitalisation weighted.
Most indices are weighted by market capitalisation.
FTSE All-Share is the oldest UK index, and tracks the vast majority (by value) of the London market. FTSE 100 (the Footsie) is the most famous UK index, tracking performance of the UK's biggest 100 listed companies.
- A rights issue invites existing shareholders to invest in additional shares. It raises cash for a company without resorting to further debt.
A rights issue offer must be open for at least two weeks.
Pre-emption rights: further share issues must be offered to existing shareholders first; shareholders can sell this right if they do not take it up.
- Cum-rights: the new owner of shares has the right to subscribe to the rights issue.
- Ex-rights: after the cut-off date, the purchaser of old shares will not receive the right to purchase new rights issue shares.
The theoretical ex-rights price is a weighted average of the price of the existing shares and the new shares.
The nil paid rights can be sold instead of buying new shares.
Value of a right on a new share:

Theoretical market value of share ex-rights - Subscription price.

Value of a right on an old share:

Theoretical market value of share ex-rights - Subscription price

Number of old shares required to purchase one new share

The pre-emption right can be bypassed in the UK under strict conditions.

- Placings: new shares from companies already listed are placed with institutional investors; they are limited to being no more than 5 per cent of share capital in a year, and 7.5 per cent over three years.
- Clawback: existing shareholders can buy new issues of shares at the offered price in an open offer, but do not receive compensation if they do not take up the offer.
- Vendor placing: when shareholders in a company are offered shares in the acquirer as part of a deal but do not wish to hold the shares. The acquirer's shares are bought by an institutional investor and the vendors receive the cash.
- Bought deal is when all of a new issue is sold to an institutional investor, who can then (hopefully) sell the shares on at a profit.
- Scrip issue is a further issue of shares given to existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings; the idea is to reduce the price of each share. Scrip issues may be issued annually to shareholders and indicate confidence in future earnings.
- Scrip dividends are issued to shareholders instead of a cash dividend.
- Splits reduce the nominal value of each share in proportion to the increase in the number of shares; the book value of the company remains the same.
- Share buy-back is a way of returning money to shareholders and possibly increasing dividends per share as there will be fewer shares over which to spread the payout.
- Special dividend is a one-off dividend returning funds to shareholders.
- Warrants give the warrant holder the right to buy shares at a fixed price on or before a specified point in time in the future.
