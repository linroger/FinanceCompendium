# Futures markets

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

This chapter describes those types of derivatives where the counterparty accepts a commitment to buy (or sell) a quantity of the underlying at a point in the future. They do not permit the option to decide at a later date whether or not to go ahead with the transaction. (Options, giving a right but not an obligation, are dealt with in the next chapter.) At the end of this chapter the reader should be able to: explain the nature of forwards and their advantages over futures;

describe a variety of futures markets, including equity futures, interest rate futures and single stock futures, and illustrate their use in hedging and speculating;

■ outline the nature and potential use of forward rate agreements; compare exchange-traded markets with over-the-counter markets.

Derivatives – forwards, futures, options, swaps, etc. – are the subject of this and the next two chapters. Derivative instruments have become increasingly important financial instruments over the past 30 years. These powerful tools can be exploited either to reduce risk or to go in search of high returns. Naturally, exceptionally high returns come with exceptionally high risk. So traders and corporate managers using derivatives for this purpose need to understand the risks to which they are exposing their company. Many fortunes have been lost by managers/traders mesmerised by the potential for riches while failing to take the time to fully understand the instruments they were buying. They jumped in, unaware of, or ignoring, the potential for enormous loss. These three chapters describe the main types of derivative and show how they can be used for controlling risk (hedging) and for reviving-up returns (speculating).

# What is a derivative?

A derivative instrument is an asset whose performance is based on (derived from) the behaviour of the value of an underlying asset (usually referred to simply as the 'underlying'). The most common underlyings include commodities (for example, tea or pork bellies), shares, bonds, share indices, currencies and interest rates. Derivatives are contracts which give the right, and sometimes the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of the underlying, or benefit in another way from a rise or fall in the value of the underlying. It is the legal right that becomes an asset, with its own value, and it is the right that is purchased or sold.

The derivatives markets have received an enormous amount of attention from the press in recent years. This is hardly surprising as spectacular losses have been made and a number of companies brought to the point of collapse through the employment of derivative instruments. Some examples of the unfortunate use of derivatives include:

- Procter & Gamble, which lost 102 million speculating on the movements of future interest rates in 1994.
- Barings, Britain's oldest merchant bank, which lost over £800 million on the Nikkei Index (the Japanese share index) contracts on the Singapore and Osaka derivatives exchanges, leading to the bank's demise in 1995.
- Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which attempted to exploit the 'mispricing' of financial instruments by making use of option pricing theory. In 1998 the firm collapsed and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cajoled 14 banks and brokerage houses to put up 3.6 billion to save LTCM and thereby prevent a financial system breakdown.
- Financial institutions that were destroyed in 2008 because they bought derivatives whose values depended on US mortgage borrowers continuing to pay their mortgages. When a proportion could not pay their debts, the derivatives (of asset-backed bonds) became either very difficult or impossible to value. The uncertainty surrounding the value of these derivatives was a trigger for the financial crisis and the subsequent recession. There was financial distress for hundreds of financial institutions that had no connection with the US mortgage market or the related derivatives.
- Société Générale, which lost €4.9 billion in 2008 when a trader placed bets on the future movements of equity markets using derivatives (up to €50 billion was gambled at one time).

In many of the financial scandals derivatives have been used (or misused) to speculate rather than to reduce risk. This chapter examines both of these applications of derivatives but places particular emphasis on the hedging (risk-mitigating) facility they provide. These are powerful tools and managers can abuse that power either through ignorance or through deliberate acceptance of greater risk in the anticipation of greater reward. However, there is nothing inherently wrong with the tools themselves. If employed properly they can be remarkably effective at limiting risk.

# A long history

Derivative instruments have been employed for more than 2,000 years. Olive growers in ancient Greece unwilling to accept the risk of a low price for their crop when harvested months later would enter into forward agreements whereby a price was agreed for delivery at a specific time. This reduced uncertainty for both the grower and the purchaser of the olives. In the Middle Ages forward contracts were traded in a kind of secondary market, particularly for wheat in Europe. A futures market was established in Osaka's rice market in Japan in the seventeenth century. Tulip bulb options were traded in seventeenth-century Amsterdam.

Commodity futures trading really began to take off in the nineteenth century with the Chicago Board of Trade regulating the trading of grains and other futures and options, and the London Metal Exchange dominating metal trading.

So derivatives are not new. What is different today is the size and importance of the derivatives markets. The last quarter of the twentieth century witnessed an explosive growth in volumes of trade, variety of derivatives products, and the number and range of users and uses. In the 30 years to 2010 the face value of outstanding derivatives contracts rose dramatically to stand at about US $600 trillion (US$ 600,000,000,000,000). Compare that with a UK annual GDP of around £1.4 trillion.

# Forwards

Imagine you are responsible for purchasing potatoes to make crisps (chips) for your firm, a snack food producer. In the free market for potatoes the price rises or falls depending on the balance between buyers and sellers. These movements can be dramatic. Obviously, you would like to acquire potatoes at a price which was as low as possible, while the potato producer wishes to sell for a price that is as high as possible. However, both parties may have a similar interest in reducing the uncertainty of price. This will assist both to plan production and budget effectively. One way in which this could be done is to reach an agreement with the producer(s) to purchase a quantity of potatoes at a price agreed today to be delivered and paid for at a specified time in the future. Crisp producers buy up to 80 per cent of their potatoes up to two years forward. Once the forward agreements have been signed and sealed the crisp manufacturer may later be somewhat regretful if the spot price (price for immediate delivery) subsequently falls below the price agreed months earlier. Unlike option contracts, forwards commit both parties to complete the deal. However, the manufacturer is obviously content to live with this potential for regret in order to remove the risk associated with such an important raw material.

A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to undertake an exchange at an agreed future date at a price agreed now.

The party buying at the future date is said to be taking a long position. The counterparty which will deliver at the future date is said to be taking a short position.

There are forward markets in a wide range of commodities but the most important forward markets today are for foreign exchange, in which hundreds of billions of dollars worth of currency are traded every working day – this will be considered in Chapter 12.

Forward contracts are tailor-made to meet the requirements of the parties. This gives flexibility on the amounts and delivery dates. Forwards are not traded on an exchange but are over-the-counter instruments - private agreements outside the regulation of an exchange. This makes them different from futures, which are standardised contracts traded on exchanges. A forward agreement exposes the counterparties to the risk of default - the failure by the other to deliver on the agreement. The risk grows in proportion to the extent by which the spot price diverges from the forward price and the incentive to renegel increases. A forward has the advantage over futures of being more available for long-term maturities, say arranging a purchase or sale three years from now, whereas most futures on regulated exchanges are limited to delivery dates within the next 12 months.

Forward contracts are difficult to cancel, as agreement from each counterparty is needed. Also, to close the contract early may result in a penalty being charged. Despite these drawbacks forward markets continue to flourish, an example of which can be seen in Exhibit 10.1.

# Northern Foods passes price rises to customers by Lucy Warwick-Ching and Ed Crooks

Customers will be hit by higher food prices as Northern Foods, maker of Fox's biscuits and Goodfellas's pizza, prepares to pass on  $40\mathrm{m}$  of rising commodity costs to customers, including the big supermarkets.

Stefan Barden, chief executive, said that in the last three months short supplies and high demand had pushed up the prices of cereals, dairy products, cocoa and fats. Poor harvests have also hit vegetable prices.

These cost increases are expected to add  $\yen 32\mathrm{m} - \yen 40\mathrm{m}$  to Northern Foods'  $\yen 400\mathrm{m}$  raw material bill, an increase of 8-10 per cent. However, Mr Barden said that, thanks to long-term contracts, forward buying and hedging, the increase this year would only be between 4-5 per cent, resulting in an extra  $16\mathrm{m} - \S 20\mathrm{m}$

# Futures

Futures contracts are in many ways similar to forward contracts. They are agreements between two parties to undertake a transaction at an agreed price on a specified future date. However, they differ from forwards in some important respects. Futures contracts are exchange-based instruments traded on a regulated exchange. The buyer and the seller of a contract do not transact with each other directly. The clearing house becomes the formal counterparty to every transaction. This reduces the risk of non-compliance with the contract significantly for the buyer or seller of a future, as it is highly unlikely that the clearing house will be unable to fulfil its obligation.

In contrast to buying options, which give you the choice to walk away from the deal, with futures you are committed and are unable to back away. This is a very important difference. In purchasing an option the maximum you can lose is the premium paid whereas you can lose multiples of the amount you employ in taking a futures position.

A simple example will demonstrate this. Imagine a farmer wishes to lock in a price for his wheat, which will be harvested in six months. You agree to purchase the wheat from the farmer six months hence at a price of £60 per tonne. You are hoping that by the time the wheat is delivered the price has risen and you can sell at a profit. The farmer is worried that all he has from you is the promise to pay £60 per tonne in six months, and if the market price falls you will walk away from the deal. To reassure him you are asked to put money into what the farmer calls a margin account. He asks and you agree to deposit £6 for each tonne you have agreed to buy. If you fail to complete the bargain the farmer will be able to draw on the money from the margin account and then sell the wheat as it is harvested at the going rate for immediate ('spot') delivery. So, as far as the farmer is concerned, the price of wheat for delivery at harvest time could fall to £54 and he is still going to get £60 for each tonne: £6 from what you paid into the margin account and £54 from selling at the spot price.

But what if the price falls below £54? The farmer is exposed to risk – something he had tried to avoid by entering a futures deal. It is for this reason that the farmer asks you to top up your margin account on a daily basis so that there is always a buffer. He sets a maintenance margin level of £6 per tonne. This means you have to maintain at least £6 per tonne in the margin account. So, if the day after you buy the future, the harvest time price in the futures market falls to £57 you have only £3 per tonne left in the margin account as a buffer for the farmer. You agreed to buy at £60 but the going rate is only £57. To bring the margin account up to a £6 buffer you will be required to put in another £3 per tonne. If the price the next day falls to £50 you will be required to put up another £7 per tonne. You agreed to buy at £60, with the market price at £50 you have put a total of £6 + £3 + £7 = £16 into the margin account. By putting in top-ups as the price moves against you, you will always ensure there is at least £6 per tonne, providing security for the farmer. Even if you go bankrupt or simply reneg on the deal he will receive at least £60 per tonne, either from the spot market or from a combination of a lower market price plus money from the margin account. As the price fell to £50 you have a £10 per tonne incentive to walk away from the deal except for the fact that you have put £16 into an account that the farmer can draw on should you be so stupid or unfortunate. If the price is £50 per tonne at expiry of the contract and you have put £16 in the margin account you are entitled to the spare £6 per tonne of margin.

It is in the margin account that we have the source of multiple losses in the futures markets. Say your life savings amount to £10 and you are convinced there will be a drought and shortage of wheat following the next harvest. In your view the price will rise to £95 per tonne. So, to cash in on your forecast you agree to buy a future for one tonne of wheat. You have agreed with the farmer that in six months you will pay £60 for the wheat, which you expect to then sell for £95. (The farmer is obviously less convinced than you that prices are destined to rise.)

To gain this right (and obligation) to buy at £60 you need only have £6 for the initial margin. The other £4 might be useful to meet day-to-day margin calls should the wheat price fall from £60 (temporarily, in your view). If the price does rise to £95 you will make a £35 profit, having laid out only £6 (plus some other cash temporarily). This is a very high return of 583 per cent over six months. But what if the price at harvest time is £40? You have agreed to pay £60, therefore the loss of £20 wipes out your savings and you are made bankrupt. You lose over three times your initial margin. That is the downside to the gearing effect of futures.

The above example demonstrates the essential features of futures market trading, but in reality participants in the market do not transact directly with each other, but go through a regulated exchange. Your opposite number, called a counterparty, is not a farmer but an organisation that acts as counterparty to all futures traders, buyers or sellers, called the central counterparty at the clearing house.

In the example we have assumed that the maintenance margin level is set at the same level as the initial margin. In reality it is often set at 70-80 per cent of the initial margin level.

An exchange provides standardised legal agreements traded in highly liquid markets. The contracts cannot be tailor-made, e.g. for 77 tonnes of wheat or coffee delivered in 37 days from now. The fact that the agreements are standardised allows a wide market appeal because buyers and sellers know what is being traded: the contracts are for a specific quality of the underlying, in specific amounts with specific delivery dates. For example, for sugar traded on NYSE Liffe one contract is for a specified grade of sugar and each contract is for a standard 50 tonnes with fixed delivery days in late August, October, December, March and May (Chapter 13 explores the commodities markets).

It is important to remember that it is the contracts themselves that are a form of security bought and sold in the market. Thus, a December future priced at 282.5 per tonne is a derivative of sugar and is not the same thing as sugar. To buy this future is to enter into an agreement with rights and obligations. It is these that are being bought and sold and not the commodity. When exercise of the contract takes place then the physical amount of sugar is bought or sold. However, as with most derivatives, usually futures positions are cancelled by an offsetting transaction before exercise.

# Marking to market and margins

With the clearing house being the formal counterparty for every buyer or seller of a futures contract, an enormous potential for credit risk is imposed on the organisation given the volume of futures traded and the size of the underlying they represent. (NYSE Liffe, for example, has an average daily volume of around 5 million contracts worth hundreds of billions of pounds/dollars.) If only a small fraction of market participants fail to deliver, this could run into hundreds of millions of pounds/dollars. To protect itself the clearing house operates a margining system by which the futures buyer or seller has to provide, usually in cash, an initial margin. The amount required depends on the futures market, the level of volatility of the underlying and the potential for default; however, it is likely to be in the region of 0.1–15 per cent of the value of the underlying. The initial margin is not a 'down payment' for the underlying: the funds do not flow to a buyer or seller of the underlying but stay with the clearing house. It is merely a way of guaranteeing that the buyer or seller will pay up should the price of the underlying move against them. It is refunded when the futures position is closed (if the market has not moved adversely).

The clearing house also operates a system of daily marking to market. At the end of every trading day the counterparty's profits or losses created as a result of that day's price change are calculated. Any counterparty that made a loss has his/her member's margin account debited. The following morning the losing counterparty must inject more cash to cover the loss if the amount in the account has fallen below a threshold level (the maintenance margin). An inability to pay a daily loss causes default and the contract is closed, thus protecting the clearing house from the possibility that the counterparty might accumulate further daily losses without providing cash to cover them. The margin account of the counterparty that makes a daily gain is credited. This may be withdrawn the next day. The daily credits and debits to members' margin accounts are known as the variation margin.

# Worked example 10.1 Margins

Imagine a buyer and seller of a future on Monday with an underlying value of £50,000 are each required to provide an initial margin of 10 per cent, or £5,000. The buyer will make profits if the price rises while the seller will make profits if the price falls. In Exhibit 10.2 it is assumed that counterparties have to keep all of the initial margin permanently as a buffer. (In reality this may be relaxed by an exchange.)

At the end of Tuesday the buyer of the contract has £1,000 debited from their member's account. This will have to be paid over the following day or the exchange will automatically close the member's position and crystallise the loss. If the buyer does provide the variation margin and the position is kept open until Friday, the account will have an accumulated credit of £5,000. The buyer has the right to buy at £50,000 but can sell at £55,000. If the buyer and the seller closed their positions on Friday the buyer would be entitled to receive the initial margin plus the accumulated profit, £5,000 + £5,000 = £10,000, whereas the seller would receive nothing (£5,000 initial margin minus losses of £5,000).

Exhibit 10.2 Example of initial margin, variation margin and marking to market

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="5">Day</td></tr><tr><td>£</td><td>Monday</td><td>Tuesday</td><td>Wednesday</td><td>Thursday</td><td>Friday</td></tr><tr><td>Value of future
(based on daily closing price)</td><td>50,000</td><td>49,000</td><td>44,000</td><td>50,000</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>Buyers&#x27; position</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Initial margin</td><td>5,000</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Variation margin (+ credited)
(− debited)</td><td>0</td><td>-1,000</td><td>-5,000</td><td>+ 6,000</td><td>+ 5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Accumulated profit (loss)</td><td>0</td><td>-1,000</td><td>-6,000</td><td>0</td><td>+ 5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sellers&#x27; position</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Initial margin</td><td>5,000</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Variation margin (+ credited)

This example illustrates the effect of leverage in futures contracts. The initial margin payments are small relative to the value of the underlying. When the underlying changes by a small percentage the effect is magnified for the future, and large percentage gains and losses are made on the amount committed to the transaction:

$$
\text{Underlying change (Monday-Friday)} \frac {55,000 - 50,000}{50,000} \times 100 = 10 \%
$$

$$
\text{Percentage return to buyer of future}\frac{5,000}{5,000}\times 100 = 100\%
$$

$$
\text{Percentage return to seller of future}\frac{-5,000}{5,000}\times 100 = -100\%
$$

To lose all the money committed to a financial transaction may seem disappointing but it is as nothing compared with the losses that can be made on futures. It is possible to lose a multiple of the amount set down as an initial margin. For example, if the future rose to  $\pounds 70,000$  the seller would have to provide a  $\pounds 20,000$  variation margin – four times the amount committed in the first place. Clearly, playing the futures market can seriously damage your wealth. This was proved with a vengeance by Nick Leeson of Barings Bank. He bought futures in the Nikkei 225 Index – the main Japanese share index – in both the Osaka and the Singapore derivative exchanges. He was betting that the market would rise as he committed the bank to buying the index at a particular price. When the index fell, margin payments had to be made. Leeson took a double-or-quits attitude: 'I mean a lot of futures traders when the market is against them will double up'. He continued to buy futures. To generate some cash, to make variation margin payments, he wrote combinations of call and put options ('straddles') for which counterparties paid premiums – see Chapter 11. This compounded the problem when the Nikkei 225 Index continued to fall in 1994. The put options became an increasingly expensive commitment to bear – counterparties had the right to sell the index to Barings at a price much higher than the prevailing price. More than  $\pounds 800\mathrm{m}$  was lost (see Exhibit 10.3).

# Exhibit 10.3

# Leeson hid trading from the outset

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/af4639b79cff63ed89f78e1b34e23eac79fa86d7d2ddd0f63d3120a843593e46.jpg)

Mr Nick Leeson opened 88888, the account in which he hid his unauthorised trading, just two days after Barings began trading on Simex at the start of July 1992.

The Singapore inspectors, who have had access to Simex data not made available to the Bank of England, show that Mr Leeson's secret futures and options positions grew slowly at first.

After losing S $10.7m ($ 4.8m) between July and October 1992, Mr Leeson brought the balance on the hidden 88888 account back close to zero in July 1993. This tallies with his own account, given in a television interview, of the relief he felt when he made back his losses in mid-1993.

But it appears that the main method by which Mr Leeson recov ered his losses, initially made on futures positions, was by selling options in a way which stored up trouble. When the market moved against him and his futures lost money, he tended to write 'straddles', a combination of options.

These produced an immediate premium which reduced the deficit in the 88888 account. But the options, on the Nikkei index of Japanese stocks, exposed Mr Leeson to a movement in the market in either direction.

They produced an initial profit, with a counterbalancing risk of loss on expiry of the options contracts. It was a highly risky form of borrowing.

From the timing of Mr Leeson's trading, it appears that the sale of these 'straddles' was an attempt to plug the hole left by punts on the market which had gone awry.

For example, in November 1993, Mr Leeson's futures losses had mounted to S4.2bn from S788m the previous month. This coincided with Mr Leeson's most intense bout of options trading, which lifted the value of the options portfolio to a surplus of S478m the following month.

But their value collapsed after the Kobe earthquake, which triggered a sharp increase in the volatility of the Japanese stock market. In any case, Mr Leeson's profits on options in 1994 were not sufficient to offset his other losses.

When markets are volatile the exchanges increase the size of the margins they require. In 2010 this, together with rising commodity prices, had a significant impact on farmers. As they tried to hedge the positions of their future crop sales in a market where prices moved up and down rapidly (but mostly up) the exchanges demanded more and more cash as margin. Farmers lose from price decreases in the cash market and so each year need to take a short position in the futures market, i.e. sell first and buy later to close their position. Thus, if prices fall they make a profit on the futures, offsetting the loss on the actual crop when sold in the cash market. The main problem in 2010 was that the price of the futures of many commodities soared (see chart in Exhibit 10.4). The exchanges both insisted on more variation margin simply because the futures position deteriorated for those with short futures positions and because the exchange increased the percentages for initial and maintenance margin because of the greater volatility.

Times could not be better for US cotton farmers. Demand from mills is strong, this year's crop is a bumper one and prices have been stratospheric.

But farmers belonging to Calcot, a cotton marketing co-operative in California, have not been reaping all the gains, at least not yet. The co-op this autumn told members final payments for their cotton would be delayed until next year because it is locked up as collateral for crop hedging deals.

Companies that own or produce physical commodities often sell futures contracts to protect their financial positions. When prices rise, however, the derivatives positions fall increasingly into the red, leading brokers to demand more collateral to ensure the companies' losses are not borne by the exchange.

With commodities markets experiencing share swings - prices have been soaring and plunging in the space of days or even hours in recent weeks - exchanges are demanding larger amounts of collateral from participants holding futures positions. Quite simply, the lengthy bull run in commodities means it is becoming ever more expensive to trade them.

Indeed, the so-called "margin calls" are eating into the cash flows of everyone trading futures contracts, from farming co-ops like Calcot to the world's biggest trading houses, banks and hedge funds.

"The current futures market situation has put tremendous pressure on our financial resources to meet margin calls," The Calcot president has told members.

Margin rates for hedgers ($'000 per contract)

Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream: CME, ICE

# Exhibit 10.4 continued as a result of higher margin calls. The higher capital requirements are driving fundamental shifts in commodity trading. Privately-held and publicity-shy traders such as Glencore, Trafigura and Louis Dreyfus are dipping their toes into the capital markets for the first time. Some smaller traders are struggling just to stay in business.

"As the commodity business becomes more capital intensive, I think there is some sort of Darwinian process that will take place," says Ricardo Leiman, chief executive of Noble, a Hong Kong-based trading house. "The amounts of capital are quite demanding."

The effects of higher margin requirements have been particularly brutal in the agricultural sector, where prices for cotton, sugar, wheat and corn have all experienced violent swings. Cotton, for example, has doubled in price in just four months, before falling 22 per cent in less than two weeks.

"We've seen stress in cotton and in coffee and in sugar - just look at what prices have done in the last three to six months and you'll see where the stress is," says Michael Vellucci, with Brown Brothers Harriman, a privately-held bank in New York.

Each significant move upwards means more margin for those who have taken short positions in the market. In ICE cotton, a market move of one cent requires an additional 500 in margin per

50,000-pound contract. Since July 1, cotton has risen more than 39 cents, meaning an additional 19,500 in margin per contract.

The issue is not so much one of solvency since, barring an unexpected disaster such as crop failure, the trader or producer owns the underlying commodity as well as the short position on the futures market – the very nature of hedging price risk.

But for the duration of the hedge, the demands for margin can have a sizeable impact on a company's liquidity, or availability of cash, especially for those whose exposure is not spread across commodities and global markets. Forced liquidation of short futures positions, moreover, can give markets a further upward push.

As volatility rises, banks rate commodity trading as a riskier activity, requiring them to hold more capital or scale back the size of their positions. Likewise, as exchanges raise the "initial margin", or the amount of capital required to open a futures position, investors such as hedge funds who regularly take short-term bets are being forced to reconsider how they are allocating their funds to commodities.

Banks and industry executives say they now prepare for price spikes, either by arranging credit lines or reducing inventory. Mr Leiman of Noble says: "If we expect prices to sky-rocket on a certain commodity, we obviously don't want to pile up on inventories on that which will have a detrimental impact on the balance sheet." Others are employing more sophisticated tactics. Some merchants with short positions in the futures markets are buying options that would profit from a spike in prices in an attempt to neutralise the impact of extreme volatility.

Bankers are also coming up with ways to limit the effects of bigger margin calls. They are offering, for a fee, to meet the liquidity risks associated with futures positions on behalf of corporate clients, via an "exchange of futures for swaps". Some are providing a simple hedge by buying the physical commodity directly from producers or trading companies at a set price, circumventing the futures market.

These efforts appear to be paying off. So far there have been no reports of merchants going under, as some did after a sudden spike in cotton prices in March 2008. "People are better prepared now," one commodities banker says.

But with prices expected to continue to see-saw, many believe an industry shake-out is all but inevitable. Mr Vellucci says: "It is far from easy. At a certain point people run out of capital."

# Settlement

Historically the futures markets developed on the basis of the physical delivery of the underlying. So if you had contracted to buy 40,000 lb. of lean hogs you would receive the meat as settlement. However, in most futures markets today (including that for lean hogs) only a small proportion of contracts result in physical delivery. The majority are closed out before the expiry of the contract and all that changes hands is cash, either as a profit or as a loss. Speculators certainly do not want to end up with five tonnes of coffee or 15,000 pounds of orange juice and so will reverse their trade before the contract expires; for example, if they originally bought a contract for 50 tonnes of white sugar they later sell a contract for 50 tonnes of white sugar.

Hedgers, say confectionery manufacturers, may sometimes take delivery from the exchange but in most cases will have established purchasing channels for sugar, cocoa, etc. In these cases they

'may use the futures markets not as a way of obtaining goods but as a way of offsetting the risk of the prices of goods moving adversely. So a confectionery manufacturer may still plan to buy, say, sugar, at the spot price from its longstanding supplier in six months and simultaneously, to hedge the risk of the price rising, will buy six-month futures in sugar. This position will then be closed before expiry. If the price of the underlying has risen the manufacturer pays more to the supplier but has a compensating gain on the future. If the price falls the supplier is paid less and so a gain is made here, but, under a perfect hedge, the future has lost an equal value.

As the futures markets developed it became clear that most participants did not want the complications of physical delivery and this led to the development of futures contracts where cash settlement takes place. This permitted a wider range of futures contracts to be created. Futures contracts based on intangible commodities such as a share index or a rate of interest are now extremely important financial instruments. With these no physical delivery takes place and if the contract is held to the maturity date one party will hand over cash to the other (via the clearing house system).

# Equity index futures

Equity index futures are an example of a cash settlement market. The underlyings here are collections of shares, for example 225 Japanese shares for the Nikkei 225. Hedgers and speculators do not want 225 different shares to be delivered say one month from now. They are quite content to receive or hand over the profit or loss made by buying and then selling (or the other way around) a future of the index.

The equity index futures table (Exhibit 10.5) from FT.com shows futures in indices from stock markets around the world for 27th October 2010. These are notional futures contracts. If not closed out before expiry (by the holder of a future doing the reverse transaction to their first – so if they

Exhibit 10.5 is very much a cut-down version of the futures available to traders. As well as the November and December delivery futures shown NYSE Liffe also offers traders the possibility of buying or selling futures that 'deliver' in March, June and September. Delivery dates are the third Friday of the month.

The table shows the first price traded at the beginning of the current day (Open), the settlement price (usually the last traded price) used to mark margin accounts to market, the change from the previous day's settlement price, the highest and lowest prices during the day's settlement price, the number of contracts traded that day (Est. vol.) and the total number of open contracts (these are trading contracts opened over the last few months that have not yet been closed by an equal and opposite futures transaction).

Each point on the UK's FTSE 100 share index future is worth £10, by convention. So if the future rises from 5634.50 to 5684.50 and you bought a future at 5634.50 you have made  $50 \times £10 = £500$  if you were to now sell at 5684.50.

# Worked example 10.2 Hedging with a share index future

It is 27 October 2010 and the FT 100 is at 5646. A fund manager wishes to hedge a £13 million fund against a decline in the market. A December FTSE 100 future is available at 5634.50 – see Exhibit 10.5. The investor retains the shares in the portfolio and sells 231 index futures contracts. Each futures contract is worth £56,345 (5634.5 points × £10). So 231 contracts are needed to cover £13 million (£13,000,000/(£10 × 5634.5) = 231).

# Outcome in December

For the sake of argument assume that the index falls by 10 per cent from 5646 to 5081, leaving the portfolio value at £11,700,000 (assuming the portfolio moves exactly in line with the FT 100 index). The closing of the futures position offsets this £1,300,000 loss by buying 231 futures at 5081 to close the position producing a profit of:

Able to sell at  $5634.5 \times 231 \times £10 =$  £13,015,695

Able to buy at  $5081 \times 231 \times £10 =$  -£11,737,110

£1,278,585

These contracts are cash settled so £1,278,585 will be paid. Furthermore, the investor receives back the margin laid down, less broker's fees.

Note that this was not a perfect hedge as more than £13 million was covered by the derivative (and the 10 per cent fall was from 5646 not 5634.50).

# Over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded derivatives

An OTC derivative is a tailor-made, individual arrangement between counterparties, usually a company and its bank. Standardised contracts (exchange-traded derivatives) are available on dozens of derivative exchanges around the world, for example the CME Group (includes Chicago Board of Trade, CBOT, the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX), NYSE Liffe, and the Eurex in Germany and Switzerland. Exhibit 10.6 compares OTC and exchange-traded derivatives.

# Exhibit 10.6 OTC and exchange-traded derivatives

# OTC derivative

# Advantages
- Contracts can be tailor-made, which allows perfect hedging and permits hedges of more unusual underlyings. It also permits contracts of very long maturities.
- Companies with a longstanding relationship with a bank can often arrange derivative deals with it, without the need to find any specific margin or deposit. The bank is willing to accept the counterparty risk of its customer reneging on the deal because it regards this possibility as very low risk, given its longstanding knowledge of the firm.

# Disadvantages
- It might be difficult to find a counterparty willing to take the opposite position for a very specific contract that suits you, e.g. to buy 250 tonnes of orange juice exactly 290 days from now. Even if the counterparty can be found the deal might be at a disadvantageous price to you because of the limited choice of counterparties you have available.
- There is a risk that the counterparty will fail to honour the transaction, therefore close attention is paid to the creditworthiness of participants – those with less than high quality reputations may not be able to transact in OTC derivatives (unless secured by a great deal of collateral). Some OTC derivative markets now have a central organisation that is counterparty to both the long holder and the short holder, but central counterparties in the OTC markets are still the exception rather than the rule (although government and regulators are pressing for more involvement of central counterparties following the financial crisis during which many traders were left exposed when their counterparties disappeared through insolvency).
- Low level of market regulation with resultant loss of transparency (e.g. what deals have taken place?) and price dissemination (private deals are not usually made public).
- Often difficult to reverse a hedge once the agreement has been made. It is sometimes difficult to find a counterparty willing to do exactly the opposite transaction to your first position. Even if you found one, you then have two counterparty risks, and often the maturity dates of the two contracts do not exactly match, leaving some unhedged exposure.
- Higher transaction costs. Because they are tailor-made both sides need to scrutinise the deal (e.g. using expensive lawyers) and monitor counterparties subsequently. This extra cost is not worth it for small deals and so forward contracts are usually counted in millions of pounds, euros, etc., whereas futures are usually in tens or hundreds of thousands.
- Transaction may not be settled promptly at the agreed time – whereas the clearing house on an exchange will insist on prompt settlement.

# Exchange-traded derivative

# Advantages

Counterparty risk is reduced because the clearing house is counterparty.

High regulation encourages transparency and openness on the price of recent trades.

- Liquidity is usually much higher than for OTC - large orders can be cleared quickly due to high daily volume of trade.
- Positions can be reversed by closing quickly – an equal and opposite transaction is completed in minutes.

# Disadvantages
- Standardisation may be restrictive, e.g. standardised terms for quality of underlying, quantity, delivery dates. Small companies, with say a £100,000 share portfolio to hedge or a €400,000 loan to hedge, find the standard quantities cumbersome (short term interest rates can be hedged – see later. For euros this is in €1m multiples only).
The limited trading hours and margin requirements may be inconvenient.

In the wake of the financial crisis governments and regulators are trying to move as much of the derivatives trades as possible away from opaque OTC markets where there is counterparty risk to exchanges, or at least electronic trading platforms, where they will be processed through clearing houses with central counterparty functions. Also there will be more open reporting of trades – at least to regulators – see Exhibit 10.7.

# Brussels in bid to tame 'wild west' markets

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/b51d8c5128d6ddce7b973d4ef8f76ca9a805b9302e98695b259b5db46506fe4f.jpg)

By Nikki Tait in Brussels

Tough rules to clamp down on the use of privately traded derivatives and speculation in shares have been unveiled by the European Commission in a bid to tame what it has called the "wild west" of financial markets.

The proposed rules aim to bring more transparency to the often-opaque world of so-called over-the-counter derivatives - financial instruments traded off-exchange between two parties.

"No financial market can afford to remain a wild west territory. The absence of any regulatory framework for OTC derivatives contributed to the financial crisis and the tremendous consequences," Michel Barnier, European Union internal market commissioner, said on Wednesday. "Today, we are pro posing rules which will bring more transparency and responsibility to derivatives markets - so we know who is doing what and who owes what to whom."

The proposals follow agreement by G20 leaders last year to standardise derivatives trading and move them on to exchanges or electronic trading platforms where appropriate. The proposals will closely align the EU with the new regime which is coming into force in the US.

The rules will require standard OTC derivatives to be processed through clearing houses - a move aimed at reducing systemic risk arising from a default of one party in an OTC deal. They will also require OTC contracts - the bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers - to be reported to "trade repositories" or data banks, and for this information to be available to regulators.

There will be exemptions from the clearing obligation for non-financial information - such as manufacturing companies - who are using OTC derivatives to hedge business risks. But Brussels also plans to make it more expensive for firms to deal in non-cleared contracts, by requiring them to hold more capital against these - although that measure will be introduced in separate legislation shortly.

The rules being proposed by the Commission will need approval both from EU member states and the European parliament. The aim is to have them in force by mid to late 2012.

There is intense competition between the 35 leading derivative exchanges around the world. They regularly design new types of futures to try to attract trade. Recent innovations include futures in house prices and in carbon (trade in the permission to emit carbon is now big business). Exhibit 10.8 shows the largest derivatives exchanges.

# Buying and selling futures

A trader in futures must deal through a registered broker (a futures commission merchant). NYSE Liffe provide a list of designated brokers (these follow rules and codes of conduct imposed by the regulators and the exchange). Gone are the days of open pit trading and those brightly coloured jackets in the UK. Trades are now conducted over a computer system on Liffe (LIFFE CONNECT™) or similar systems at other exchanges such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in the US. You can place a price limit for your trade – the maximum you are willing to pay if you are buying or a minimum if you are selling. Alternatively you can make an at-the-market order, to be executed immediately at the price determined by current supply and demand conditions. The buyer of a contract is said to be in a long position – they agree to receive the underlying. The seller who agrees to deliver the underlying is said to be in a short position.

If the amount in the trader's account falls below the maintenance margin the trader will receive a demand to inject additional money. This may happen every day so the trader cannot buy/sell a future and then go on holiday for a month (unless they leave plenty of cash with the broker to meet margin calls). Prices are set by competing market makers on LIFFE CONNECT™. Real-time market prices are available on the Internet, as well as historical prices (www.liffe-data.com).

Trading costs include brokerage commissions, market maker's spread, taxes and fees imposed by the exchange.

# Single stock futures

As well as being able to buy or sell futures on commodities or entire share indices, you can trade futures in a particular company's shares. You can agree to buy 100 or 1,000 shares (one future contract) in, say, Royal Dutch Shell two or three months from now at a price that is agreed now (maximum of six months ahead). Exhibit 10.9 shows one of the stock futures traded on NYSE Liffe on 14 December 2010.

Suppose you want to speculate that Royal Dutch Shell will fall in price between 14 December 2010 (now) and the third Friday in February 2011 (the delivery date for the February futures shown in Exhibit 10.9). You could sell, say, 1,000 contracts (100,000 shares for delivery in February) at a price of €24.289 (the ask price of €24.326 is what you can deal at with the market maker if you were going long – buying. The market maker in these futures makes a spread profit of €24.326–€24.289 if he fulfils both a buy and a sell order for one futures contract). Imagine now that the February futures price falls to €20 in late February; you could close your position by buying 1,000 futures. Your profit would be:

Sold 100,000 shares at €24.289

€2,428,900

Bought 100,000 shares at €20

€2,000,000

€428,900

(less dealing costs). You could have made this profit by putting down a margin of only about €150,000, $^9$  thus almost quadrupling your money in a few weeks.

On the other hand, if the March futures rose to €27 and you closed your position for fear of the price rising further, then the loss of €2,428,900 – €2,700,000 = -€271,100 would wipe out your initial margin and you would be required to provide a further €121,100. If single stock futures are held to the delivery date then they are usually settled in cash rather than by the delivery of shares (i.e. if you have made a gain you receive it in cash). However, a few are settled with physically delivered shares. The Financial Times no longer carries single stock futures data, but the Euronext (part of NYSE Liffe) website covers dozens of companies.

# Worked example 10.3 An example of single stock future use

Suppose you hold 30,000 Vodafone shares with a current market price of 126p. You bought these for 76p and therefore your capital gain is 50p per share, or £15,000. You are convinced the market is due for a fall. To protect yourself you could sell the Vodafone shares. However, this will result in capital gain tax.

An alternative is to sell 30 stock futures in Vodafone at 126.50p while holding onto the shares. If the market does fall you are protected on the downside. The gain made on the stock futures offsets the loss on the underlying shares. So, if the underlying and the future price falls to 95p the loss on the shares, £9,300, is offset by the gain on the stock futures.

Sold for 126.50p

$$
= £ 3 7, 9 5 0
$$

Bought for 95p

$$
= £ 2 8, 5 0 0
$$

$$
£ 9,450
$$

This stock futures gain can be taken over into another tax year to use the capital allowance. So, in effect, you have delayed capital gain realisation, thereby legitimately avoiding tax while locking in your gain during the market fall.

# Short-term interest rate futures

Trillions of pounds, dollars and euros of trading takes place every year in the short-term interest rate futures markets. These are notional fixed-term deposits, usually for three-month periods starting at a specific time in the future. The buyer of one contract is buying the (theoretical) right to deposit money at a particular rate of interest for three months.

So if the current time is December you could arrange a futures contract for you to 'deposit' and 'receive interest' on, say £1 million, with the deposit starting next June and ending in September. The rate of interest you will 'receive' over the three summer months is agreed in December. (This is a notional receipt of interest, as these contracts are cash settled rather than actual deposits being made and interest received – see below for an example.) So you now own the right to deposit £1 million and receive × per cent interest for three months (at least in notional terms).

Short-term interest rate futures will be illustrated using the three-month sterling market, that is, deposits of pounds receiving notional interest for three months starting at some point in the future. Note, however, that there are many other three-month deposits you could make. For example, you could 'deposit' euros for three months, the interest rate on which is calculated with reference to 'Euribor  $3\mathrm{m}$  , which is the interest rate highly rated banks pay to other banks for three-month deposits of the currency of the Eurozone countries, the euro. Other three-month deposits are often for money held outside the jurisdiction of the currency's country of origin (i.e. Euro' currencies, in the sense of being international money and not the new currency in the Eurozone) and include Swiss francs deposited in London (Euroswiss), Eurodollars and Euroyens - see Exhibit 10.10. (Eurocurrency is discussed in Chapter 5.)

The unit of trading for a three-month sterling time deposit is  $\mathbb{L}500,000$ . Cash delivery by closing out the futures position is the means of settlement, so the buyer would not actually require the seller of the future to accept the  $\mathbb{L}500,000$  on deposit for three months at the interest rate indicated by the futures price. Although the term 'delivery' no longer has significance for the underlying it does define the date and time of the expiry of the contract. This occurs in late September, December, March and June and the nearest two consecutive months. (See www.euronext.com for precise definitions and delivery dates.)

Short-term interest contracts are quoted on an index basis rather than on the basis of the interest rate itself. The price is defined as:

$$
\mathrm {P} = 1 0 0 - i
$$ where:


$$

P = p r i c e \quad i n d e x

$$

$i =$  the future interest rate in percentage terms.

Thus, on 15 December 2010 the settlement price for a June three-month sterling future was 98.99, which implies an interest rate of  $100 - 98.99 = 1.01$  per cent for the period June to September – see Exhibit 10.10. Similarly, the September quote would imply an interest rate of  $100 - 98.80 = 1.20$  per cent for the three months September to December 2011.

In both cases the implied interest rate refers to a rate applicable for a notional deposit of £500,000 for three months on expiry of the contract – the June futures contract expires in June (i.e. the right to 'deposit' in June through to September expires in June) and the September future expires in September. The 1.01 per cent rate for three-month money starting from June 2011 is the annual rate of interest even though the deal is for a deposit of only one-quarter of a year.

The price of 98.99 is not a price in the usual sense – it does not mean £98.99. It is used to maintain the standard inverse relationship between prices and interest rates. For example, if traders in this market one week later, on 22 December 2010, adjusted supply and demand conditions because they expect generally raised inflation and raised interest rates by the middle of 2011, they would push up the interest rates for three-month deposits starting in June 2011 to, say, 2.0 per cent. Then the price of the future would fall to 98.00. Thus, a rise in interest rates for a three-month deposit of money results in a fall in the price of the contract – analogous to the inverse relationship between interest rates offered on long-term bonds and the price of those bonds.

In relation to short-term interest rate futures it is this inverse change in capital value when interest rates change that it is crucial to grasp. Understanding this is more important than trying to envisage deposits of £500,000 being placed some time in the future.

# Worked example 10.4 Hedging three-month deposits

An example of these derivatives in use may help with gaining an understanding of their hedging qualities. Imagine the treasurer of a large company anticipates the receipt of £100m in late September 2011, slightly more than ten months hence. She expects that the money will be needed for production purposes in January 2012 but for the three months following late September it can be placed on deposit. There is a risk that interest rates will fall between now (December 2010) and September 2011 from their present level of 1.20 per cent per annum for three-month deposits starting in late September. (The sterling 3m September future in Exhibit 10.10 shows a price of 98.80, indicating an interest rate of 1.20 per cent.)

The treasurer does not want to take a passive approach and simply wait for the inflow of money and deposit it at whatever rate is then prevailing without taking some steps to ensure a good return. To achieve certainty in September 2011 she buys, in December 2010, September 2011 expiry three-month sterling interest rate futures at a price of 98.80. Each future has a notional value of £500,000 and therefore she has to buy 200 to hedge the £100 million inflow.

Suppose in September 2011 that three-month interest rates have fallen to 0.95 per cent. Following the actual receipt of the £100 million the treasurer can place it on deposit and receive a return over the next three months of £100m × 0.0 095 ×  $\frac{3}{12} =$ 237,500. This is significantly less than if September 2011 three-month deposit interest rates had remained at 1.20 per cent throughout the ten-month waiting period.

Return at 1.20 per cent (£100m × 0.012 ×  $\frac{3}{12}$ ) = £300,000

Return at 0.95 per cent (£100m × 0.0095 ×  $\frac{3}{12}$ ) = £237,500
Loss £62,500

However, the treasurer's caution pays off because the futures have risen in value as the interest rates have fallen.

The 200 futures contracts were bought at 98.80. With interest rates at 0.95 per cent for three-month deposits starting in September the futures in September have a value of  $100 - 0.95 = 99.05$ . The treasurer in September can close the futures position by selling the futures for 99.05. Thus, a purchase was made in December 2010 at 98.80 and a sale in September 2011 at 99.05, therefore the gain that is made amounts to  $99.05 - 98.80 = 0.25$ .

This is where a tick needs to be introduced. A tick is the minimum price movement on a future. On a three-month sterling interest rate contract a tick is a movement of 0.01 per cent on a trading unit of £500,000.

One-hundredth of 1 per cent of £500,000 is equal to £50, but this is not the value of one tick. A further complication is that the price of a future is based on annual interest rates whereas the contract is for three months. Therefore £50/4 = £12.50 is the value of a tick movement in a three-month sterling interest rate futures contract. In this case we have a gain of 25 ticks with an overall value of  $25 \times £12.50 = £312.50$  per contract, or £62,500 for 200 contracts. The profit on the futures exactly offsets the loss of anticipated interest when the £100m is put on deposit for three months in September.

Note that the deal struck in December was not to enter into a contract to actually deposit  $£100m$  with the counterparty on the NYSE Liffe market. The  $\pounds 100\mathrm{m}$  is deposited in September with any one of hundreds of banks with no connection to the futures contract that the treasurer entered into. The actual deposit and the notional deposit (on NYSE Liffe) are two separate transactions. However, the transactions are cleverly arranged so that the value movements on these two exactly offset each other. All that is received from NYSE Liffe is the tick difference, based on the price change between the buying and selling prices of the futures contracts – no interest is received.

# Worked example 10.5 Hedging a loan

In December 2010 Holwell plc plans to borrow £5 million for three months at a later date. This will begin in June 2011. Worried that short-term interest rates will rise, Holwell hedges by selling ten three-month sterling interest rate futures contracts with June expiry. The price of each futures contract is 98.99, so Holwell has locked into an annual interest rate of 1.01 per cent or 0.2525 per cent for three months. The cost of borrowing is therefore:

$$

\text {£ 5 m} \times 0. 0 0 2 5 2 5 = £ 1 2, 6 2 5

$$

Suppose that interest rates rise to annual rates of 1.6 per cent, or 0.4 per cent per quarter. The cost of borrowing for Holwell will be:

$$

£ 5 \mathrm {m} \times 0. 0 0 4 = £ 2 0, 0 0 0

$$

However, Holwell is able to buy ten futures contracts to close the position on the exchange. Each contract has fallen in value from 98.99 to 98.40; this is 59 ticks. The profit credited to Holwell's margin account on NYSE Liffe will now stand at:

Bought at 98.40, sold at 98.99:

59 ticks  $\times$  £12.50  $\times$  10 contracts = £7,375

Holwell pays interest to its lender for the three months June to September at 1.6 per cent annual rate. The extra interest is an additional £7,375 (£20,000 - £12,625) compared with the rate in the market for June to September when Holwell was looking at the issue back in December. However, the derivative profit offsets the extra interest cost on the loan Holwell takes out in June.

Note that if interest rates fall Holwell will gain by being charged lower interest on the actual loan, but this will be offset by the loss of the futures. Holwell sacrifices the benefits of potential favourable movements in rates to reduce risk.

# Forward rate agreements (FRAs)

FRAs are useful devices for hedging future interest rate risk. They are agreements about the future level of interest rates. The rate of interest at some point in the future is compared with the level agreed when the FRA was established and compensation is paid by one party to the other based on the difference.

For example, a company needs to borrow  $\frac{16}{5}$  million in six months' time for a period of a year. It arranges this with Bank X at a variable rate of interest. The current rate of interest is 7 per cent. (For the sake of argument assume that this is the LIBOR rate for borrowing starting in six months and lasting one year, and that this company can borrow at LIBOR.) The company is concerned that by the time the loan is drawn down interest rates will be higher than 7 per cent, increasing the cost of borrowing.

The company enters into a separate agreement with another bank (Y) – an FRA. It 'purchases' an FRA at an interest rate of 7 per cent. This is to take effect six months from now and relates to a 12-month loan. Bank Y will not lend any money to the company but it has committed itself to paying compensation should interest rates (LIBOR) rise above 7 per cent.

Suppose that in six months spot one-year interest rates are 8.5 per cent. The company will be obliged to pay Bank X this rate: £6 million × 0.085 = £510,000; this is £90,000 more than if the interest rates were 7 per cent.[10] However, the FRA with Bank Y entitles the company to claim compensation equal to the difference between the rate agreed in the FRA and the spot rate. This is (0.085 - 0.07) × £6m = £90,000. So any increase in interest cost above 7 per cent is exactly matched by a compensating payment provided by the counterparty to the FRA. However, if rates fall below 7 per cent the company makes payments to Bank Y. For example, if the spot rate in six months is 5 per cent the company benefits because of the lower rate charged by Bank X, but suffers an equal offsetting compensation payment to Bank Y of (0.07 - 0.05) × £6m = £120,000. The company has generated certainty over the effective interest cost of borrowing in the future. Whichever way the interest rates move it will pay £420,000.

This example is a gross simplification. In reality FRAs are generally agreed for three-month periods. So this company could have four separate FRAs for the year. It would agree different rates for each three-month period. If three-month LIBOR turns out to be higher than the agreed rate, Bank Y will pay the difference to the company. If it is lower the company pays Bank Y the difference.

The 'sale' of an FRA by a company protects it against a fall in interest rates. For example, if £10 million is expected to be available for putting into a one-year bank deposit in three months from now the company could lock into a rate now by selling an FRA to a bank. Suppose the agreed rate is 6.5 per cent and the spot rate in three months is 6 per cent, then the depositor will receive 6 per cent from the bank into which the money is placed plus  $\frac{1}{2}$  per cent from the FRA counterparty bank.

The examples above are described as 6 against 18 (or  $6 \times 18$ ) and 3 against 15 (or  $3 \times 15$ ). The first is a 12-month contract starting in six months, the second is a 12-month contract starting in three months. Typically sums of  $£5\mathrm{m}-£100$  million are hedged in single deals in this market. Companies do not need to have an underlying lending or borrowing transaction – they could enter into an FRA in isolation and make or receive compensating payments only.

Banks enter FRAs between themselves as well as transacting with corporates. FRAs can be arranged in highly liquid markets in all the major currencies – the market has so much activity that the rates offered are displayed on computer screens by banks and brokers. Deals are agreed either over the telephone or over a dealing system such as Reuters.

# Derivatives users

There are three types of user of the derivatives markets: hedgers, speculators and arbitrageurs.

# Hedgers

To hedge is to enter into transactions which protect a business or assets against changes in some underlying. The instruments bought as a hedge tend to have the opposite-value movements to the underlying. Financial and commodity markets are used to transfer risk from an individual or corporation to another more willing and/or able to bear that risk.

Consider a firm which discovers a rich deposit of platinum in Kenya. The management are afraid to develop the site because they are uncertain about the revenues that will actually be realised. Some of the sources of uncertainty are that: (a) the price of platinum could fall, (b) the floating-rate loan taken out to develop the site could become expensive if interest rates rise and (c) the value of the currencies could move adversely. The senior managers have more or less decided that they will apply the firm's funds to a less risky venture. A recent graduate steps forward and suggests that this would be a pity, saying: 'The company is passing up a great opportunity, and Kenya and the world economy will be poorer as a result. Besides, the company does not have to bear all of these risks given the sophistication of modern financial markets. The risks can be hedged, to limit the downside. For example, the platinum could be sold on the forwards or the futures market, which will provide a firm price. The interest-rate risk can be reduced by using an FRA or the interest futures markets. Other possibilities here include a 'cap' or a swap arrangement into a fixed-rate loan (these are discussed in the next chapter). The currency risk can be controlled by using currency forwards or options (discussed in Chapter 12).' The board decide to press ahead with development of the mine and thus show that derivatives can be used to promote economic well-being by transferring risk.

# Speculators

Speculators take a position in financial instruments and other assets with a view to obtaining a profit on changes in price. Speculators accept high risk in anticipation of high reward. The gearing effect of derivatives makes speculation in these instruments particularly profitable, or particularly ruinous. Speculators are also attracted to derivatives markets because they are often more liquid than the underlying markets. In addition the curator is able to sell before buying (to 'short' the market) in order to profit from a fall. More complex trading strategies are also possible.

The term speculator in popular parlance is often used in a somewhat critical fashion. This is generally unwarranted. Speculators are needed by financial markets to help create trading liquidity. Many people argue that prices are more, not less, likely to be stable as a result of speculative activity. Usually speculators have dissimilar views regarding future market movements and this provides two-way liquidity which allows other market participants, such as hedgers, to carry out a transaction quickly without moving the price. Imagine if only hedgers with an underlying were permitted to buy or sell derivatives. Very few trades would take place each day. If a firm wished to make a large hedge this would be noticed in the market and the price of the derivative would be greatly affected. Speculators also provide a kind of insurance for hedgers - they accept risk in return for a premium.

Speculators are also quick to spot new opportunities and to shift capital to new areas of economic output. For example, if a speculator foresees a massive rise in the demand for cobalt because of its use in mobile phones they will start to buy futures in the commodity, pushing up the price. This will alert the mining companies to go in search of more cobalt deposits around the world and pump money into those countries that have it, such as the Congo. The speculator has to examine the underlying economic messages emanating from the world economy and respond to them in a truthful manner – dumping the currency of a badly run country or selling bond derivatives in banks, for example. Those on the receiving end of those messages often resent having the truth revealed when they have tried to conceal it for so long and hoped to go on doing so. Exhibit 10.11 discusses the populist anti-speculator rhetoric as well as pointing out the value of speculators.


Exhibit 10.11

# The truth about speculators: they are doing God's work

FT

Paul Murphy

"Speculators" are in the frame. Every day, it seems, a politician or senior official from somewhere across Europe spits out the dirty word "speculators" and then proceeds to demand immediate action, retribution, or both.

There's never much detail in these attacks. No need for it. Speculation is bad, right? And if there is any detail, such as discussion of those dreaded credit default swaps, there's usually some mix-up about who's doing the buying or selling or shorting or snorting or whatever people do these days with mutated derivatives.

No matter. Speculation is evil since speculators produce nothing of tangible value. Parasite Capital, LP. Case closed.

The populist rhetoric goes down well. Understandably, the people of Europe, staring austerity in the face, want someone to blame - and the notion that somebody, somewhere is benefitting from their misery makes the blood of ordinary mortals boil. So the claptrap works. Good politicians are seen to be bringing the bad guys to heel, albeit belatedly.

The trouble is that speculation is to financial markets what claptrap is to the political system: absolutely crucial. Populist bombast grabs the attention of the electorate, it gets a politician known and, ultimately, ensures they get elected. Similarly, speculators, faceless or otherwise, make markets more efficient by providing the liquidity which makes trades possible and, ultimately, produce more accurate prices. They help us allocate capital as efficiently as we can.


How is it that our political elite does not know this? Have Europe's leaders forgotten that we live in a market economy?

Clearly, there's a need for an educational refresher on the matter.

Ms Merkel et al might like to start with an 80 year-old tome - Phillip Carret's classic from 1930, The Art of Speculation (reprinted 1997).

Yes, the contents page alone might bring on a coronary in Athens, Berlin or Paris ("The speculator increases profits by borrowing money ... Short selling is essential to an orderly market ... The short seller does not injure the long trader"), but Carret's prose is as elegant and instructive today as it was eight decades ago. A taste:

"Those who decry stock market speculation usually have stock market gambling in mind. The speculators are those who use brains as well as ink in writing the order slips for their brokers. They perform a service of substantial value to society."

"Just as water always seeks its level, answering the pull of gravity, so in the securities markets prices are always seeking a level of values. Speculation is the agency by which the adjustment is made. Has a new industry arisen, filling a new demand, adding new wealth to society, requiring new capital in generous value? The alert speculator discovers it, buys the securities, advertises its prosperity to the investing public, provides it with a new credit base."

"In this fashion the speculator is the advance agent of the investor, seeking always to bring market prices into line with investment values, opening new reservoirs of capital to the growing enterprise, shutting off the supply from enterprises which have not profitably used that which they already possessed."

Carret teaches that speculators and speculation touch all parts of our lives - from high street retailers offering a new line of fashion to the hedge fund denizens of London's Mayfair or Greenwich, Connecticut, taking a dim view on the stresses affecting European monetary union. Indeed, even the most conservative self-declared "investor" is always part-speculator.

More from his instruction manual: "In fact, speculation is inseparable from investment. The investor must assume some degree of speculative risk; the intelligent investor will seek a certain measure of speculative profit. If he has the time, the temperament, the ability, the investor may go a step further and seek speculative profit in preference to dividend and interest income from his capital."

"In doing so he is performing a valuable service to the investor, acting as his advance agent in seeking the most profitable channels of investment, increasing the marketability of investment holdings, helping to support the financial machinery which is designed primarily for the service of the investor."

Carret, we should note, was no market spiv. But he did take the risk of setting up one of America's first mutual funds, the Fidelity Investment Trust, which later became better known as the Pioneer Trust. He died 12 years ago at the age of 101.


His teachings are as relevant now as ever. Greece, Italy, the UK and others under supposed "speculative attack" are in that position because there is a view that they are "falling upon evil days".


"Advance agents" are telling us that there are problems with too much public debt in the western world, and simply legislating or regulating those agents out of the way is not going to fix things.

What Carret is pointing out is that speculators tell us the truth about what is happening or is likely to happen soon. For a number of European governments, the truth is a little too much to bear right now.

# Arbitrageurs

The act of arbitrage is to exploit price differences on the same instrument or similar assets. The arbitrageur buys at the lower price and immediately resells at the higher price. So, for example, Nick Leeson claimed that he was arbitrating Nikkei 225 Index futures. The same future is traded in both Osaka and Singapore. Theoretically the price should be identical on both markets, but in reality this is not always the case and it is possible simultaneously to buy the future in one market and sell the future in the other and thereby make a risk-free profit. An arbitrageur waits for these opportunities to exploit a market inefficiency. The problem for Barings Bank was that Nick Leeson obtained funds to put down as margin payments on arbitrage trades but then bought futures in both markets – surreptitiously switching from an arbitrage activity to a highly risky, speculative activity. True arbitrageurs help to ensure pricing efficiency – their acts of buying or selling tend to reduce pricing anomalies.

# Concluding comments

From a small base in the 1970s derivatives have grown to be of enormous importance. Almost all medium and large industrial and commercial firms use derivatives, usually to manage risk, but occasionally to speculate and arbitrage. Banks are usually at the centre of derivatives trading, dealing on behalf of clients, as market makers or trading on their own account. Other financial institutions are increasingly employing these instruments to lay off risk or to speculate. They can be used across the globe, and traded night and day.

The trend suggests that derivatives will continue their relentless rise in significance. They can no longer be dismissed as peripheral to the workings of the financial and economic systems. The implications for investors, corporate institutions, financial institutions, regulators and governments are going to be profound. These are incredibly powerful tools, and, like all powerful tools, they can be used for good or ill. Ignorance of the nature of the risks being transferred, combined with greed, has already led to some very unfortunate consequences. However, on a day-to-day basis, and away from the newspaper headlines, the ability of firms to quietly tap the markets and hedge risk encourages wealth creation and promotes general economic well-being.

# Key points and concepts

A derivative instrument is an asset whose performance is based on the behaviour of an underlying asset (the underlying).
- A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to undertake an exchange at an agreed future date at a price agreed now. Forwards are tailor-made, over-the-counter agreements, allowing flexibility.

The party buying at the future date is said to be taking a long position. The counterparty which will deliver at the future date is said to be taking a short position.
- Futures are agreements between two parties to undertake a transaction at an agreed price on a specified future date. They are exchange-traded instruments with a clearing house acting as counterparty to every transaction standardised as to:
- quality of underlying; quantity of underlying;
- legal agreement details; delivery dates;
trading times;
- margins.

For futures, initial margin (0.1 per cent to 15 per cent) is required from each buyer or seller. Each day profits or losses are established through marking to market, and variation margin is payable by the holder of the loss-making future who loses to avoid going below the maintenance margin level.
- The majority of futures contracts are closed (by undertaking an equal and opposite transaction) before expiry and so cash losses or profits are made rather than settlement by delivery of the underlying. Some futures are settled by cash only – there is no physical delivery.
Equity index futures are a cash settlement market in which the underlyings are notional collections of shares.
- Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are tailor-made and available on a wide range of underlyings. They allow perfect hedging and there is the possibility of a bank counterparty not requiring margin or deposit. However, they suffer from counterparty risk, low regulation, poor transparency and poor price dissemination, frequent inability to reverse a hedge and higher transaction costs.
- Exchange-traded derivatives have lower credit (counterparty) risk, greater regulation, higher liquidity and greater ability to reverse positions than OTC derivatives. However, standardisation can be restrictive.
A trader in futures must deal through a registered broker. Trades are now conducted over a computer system on Liffe (LIFFE CONNECT™). You can place a price limit for your trade or make an at-the-market order, to be executed immediately at the price determined by current supply and demand conditions.
- Single stock futures have as their underlying 100 or 1,000 shares in a single company quoted on a stock market, e.g. BP shares. You can go long or short on the future which will be dated up to six months from the current time.
- Short-term interest-rate futures can be used to hedge against rises and falls in interest rates at some point in the future. The price for a £500,000 notional three-month contract is expressed as an index:  $\mathrm{P} = {100} - i$

As interest rates rise the value of the index falls.
- Forward rate agreements (FRAs) are arrangements whereby one party pays the other should interest rates at some point in the future differ from an agreed rate.
- Hedgers enter into transactions to protect a business or assets against changes in some underlying.
- Speculators accept high risk by taking a position in financial instruments and other assets with a view to obtaining a profit on changes in value.
Arbitrageurs exploit price differences on the same or similar assets.

# Questions and problems

1 Adam, a speculator, is convinced that the stock market will fall significantly in the forthcoming months. The current market index (14 August) level is 4997 (FTSE 100). He is investigating a strategy to exploit this market fall: sell five FTSE 100 Index futures on NYSE Liffe with a December expiry, current price 5086.

Extracts from the Financial Times

<table><tr><td colspan="3">FTSE 100 Index Futures (LIFFE) £10 per full index point</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Open</td><td>Sett. Price</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>5069</td><td>5020</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>5128</td><td>5086</td></tr></table>

Assume: no transaction costs.

# Required

For the derivative

(a) What would the profit (loss) be if the index rose to 5500 in December under the strategy?
(b) What would the profit (loss) be if the index fell to 4500 in December under the strategy?

2 A manager controlling a broadly based portfolio of UK large shares wishes to hedge against a possible fall in the market. It is October and the portfolio stands at  $£30\mathrm{m}$  with the FTSE 100 Index at 5020. The March futures price is 5035 (10 per index point).

# Required

(a) Describe a way in which the manager could hedge against a falling market. Show the number of derivatives.
(b) What are the profits/losses if the FTSE 100 Index moves to 4000 or 6000 in March?
(c) Draw a profit/loss diagram for the strategy. Show the value of the underlying portfolio at different index levels, the value of the derivative and the combined value of the underlying and the derivative.

3 A buyer of a futures contract in Imaginationum with an underlying value of £400,000 on 1 August is required to deliver an initial margin of 5 per cent to the clearing house. This margin must be maintained as each day the counterparties in the futures are marked to market.

# Required

(a) Display a table showing the variation margin required to be paid by this buyer and the accumulated profit/loss balance on her margin account in the eight days following the purchase of the future. (Assume that the maintenance margin is the same as the initial margin.)

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Value of Imaginationum (£000s)</td><td>390</td><td>410</td><td>370</td><td>450</td><td>420</td><td>400</td><td>360</td><td>410</td></tr></table>

(b) Explain what is meant by 'gearing returns' with reference to this example.
(c) Compare forwards and futures markets and explain the coexistence of these two.

4 A corporate treasurer expects to receive £20 million in late September, six months hence. The money will be needed for expansion purposes the following December. However, in the intervening three months it can be deposited to earn interest. The treasurer is concerned that interest rates will fall from the present level of 8 per cent over the next six months, resulting in a poorer return on the deposited money.

A forward rate agreement (FRA) is available at 8 per cent.

Three-month sterling interest futures starting in late September are available, priced at 92.00.

Assume: No transaction costs and that a perfect hedge is possible.

# Required

(a) Describe two hedging transactions that the treasurer could employ.
(b) Show the profit/loss on the underlying and the derivative under each strategy if market interest rates fall to 7 per cent, and if they rise to 9 per cent.

5 Three-month sterling interest-rate futures are quoted as follows on 30 August:

<table><tr><td></td><td>£500,000, points of 100\% Settlement price</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>91.50</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>91.70</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>91.90</td></tr></table>

Red Wheel plc expects to need to borrow £15 million at floating rate in late December for three months and is concerned that interest rates will rise between August and December.

Assume: no transaction costs.

# Required

(a) Show a hedging strategy that Red Wheel could employ to reduce uncertainty.
(b) What is the effective rate of interest payable by Red Wheel after taking account of the derivative transaction if three-month spot rates are 10 per cent in December? Show the gain on the derivative.
(c) What is the effective rate of interest after taking account of the derivative transaction if three-month spot rates are 7 per cent in December? Show the loss on the derivative.
(d) Compare short-term interest-rate futures and FRAs as alternative hedging techniques for a situation such as Red Wheel's.

6 Speculators, hedgers and arbitrageurs are all desirable participants in the derivatives markets. Explain the role of each.

Each future is for 100 shares and is cash settled. Prices quoted by market makers are in euros per share. Shares are selling on the spot market for €45.65.

You own 50,000 shares in Akzo Nobel, but you are not sure about the company's prospects. On the one hand as Europe emerges from recession, demand for Akzo Nobel's products will rise, leading to good share returns. On the other, Europe could have a second downturn and so Akzo Nobel's shares will plummet. You estimate that the uncertainty will be lifted by 11 March 2011.

(a) Describe a hedging strategy you could employ to reduce price uncertainty between now (7 January 2011) and 11 March 2011.
(b) Show the gain/losses on underlying and derivative transaction if the share price on 11 March is €50.
(c) Show the gain/losses on underlying and derivative transaction if the share price on 11 March is €40.

# Assignments

1 Obtain the annual report and accounts of ten leading companies in your country. Write a report describing the use of futures, forwards and forward rate agreements by these companies and explaining the benefits they gain from using the derivative markets.

2 Investigate the extent of futures, forwards and FRAs use by the treasury department of a firm you know well. Explain the purpose of their use and consider alternative instruments than those they have used in the past.

# Web-based exercises

1 Go to www.euronext.com to obtain information on the variety of stock index futures, commodity futures and stock futures. Draw up tables showing the specifications in terms of unit of trading, delivery months, minimum price movement (tick size), delivery day and any other factors that are relevant to understanding the operation of these markets. Write a report detailing the possible hedges that a large corporation might use these markets for (include numerical illustrations).
2 Go to www.ft.com to obtain the latest data for three-month sterling, Eurodollar and Euribor three-month interest rate futures. Now imagine that you are a consultant to a multinational corporation that has the following expected transactions over the next year:

(a) Receipt of US10m in seven months from now. This is to be held on deposit for three months until it is used by the Venezuelan subsidiary. The managers want to lock in the interest rate for the period they hold the dollars.
(b) Borrowing of £20 million and €50 million starting in nine months from now. The borrowing (from the company's UK bank) is at variable rate depending on interest rates reigning at the time. The directors want to hedge against a rise in interest rates over the next nine months.

Required: advise the directors on the hedges they could put in place in the interest rate futures market. In this process explain and illustrate the transactions, the gains and losses on the underlying and interest rate futures position for some possible interest rates six and nine months hence.
