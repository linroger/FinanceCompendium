# Chapter 11: Options and Swaps

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

There are many practical uses of the derivatives discussed in this chapter, and this is where our emphasis lies, on the practical rather than the theoretical and mathematical. By the end of the chapter you should be able to: explain the nature of options and illustrate the use of individual share options and share index options;

describe the way in which spread betting and contracts for difference deals work;

- outline the advantages of using caps and floors;

- discuss the use of interest rate swaps, and their relationship with forward rate agreements; show the value of the credit default swaps markets for those faced with credit risk.

The last chapter showed how derivatives can be used to fix a future outcome. So, if you are currently vulnerable to rises in interest rates, for example, you can arrange an offsetting future agreement that has the opposite value movements to your current exposure. If interest rates rise you lose on the underlying but gain an equal amount on the future. If they fall you gain by paying less on the underlying but lose an equal amount on the future.

The problem with futures, forwards and FRAs is that they do not allow you to benefit from a favourable movement in the underlying. Options, on the other hand, do. With an option you can choose at a later date whether or not you would like to proceed with the deal or not. If you let it lapse after a favourable movement in the underlying you can gain that benefit without suffering an equal loss on the derivative.

The other major category examined in this chapter is swaps. These allow you to exchange a series of future cash payment obligations. For example, your company could have a loan agreement whereby it pays a series of interest amounts based on whatever six-month LIBOR is at the time, through a period of seven years. Obviously, the concern you have is that LIBOR might jump to a much higher level at some point in the seven years, which might jeopardise the firm. One solution is to agree with a counterparty to pay it fixed interest rate obligations if it agrees to pay you LIBOR every six months. This can reduce risk for both.

Credit default swaps, invented only in the 1990s, allow you to pass on the risk of a borrower defaulting on a debt deal to other participants in the financial markets, in return for a fee (premium). These are instruments that can be used to reduce risk or to speculate.

As well as options, swaps and credit default swaps this chapter examines caps, which permit a limit to be set on interest paid, and floors, which can be used to set a minimum interest to be received. And then there are spread bets and contracts for difference which allow the purchaser to gain from a rise or fall in the price of an underlying without ever owning it. These are very popular with small investors as well as large corporations engaged in takeovers, or simply for hedging and speculating.

## Options

An option is a contract giving one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a financial instrument, commodity or some other underlying asset at a given price, at or before a specified date. The purchaser of the option can either exercise the right or let it lapse – the choice is theirs.

A very simple option would be where a firm pays the owner of land a non-returnable premium (say £10,000) for an option to buy the land at an agreed price because the firm is considering the development of a retail park within the next five years. The property developer may pay a number of option premiums to owners of land in different parts of the country. If planning permission is eventually granted on a particular plot the option to purchase may be exercised. In other words the developer pays the price agreed with the farmer at the time that the option contract was arranged, say £1 million, to purchase the land. Options on other plots may be allowed to lapse and will have no value. By using an option the property developer has 'kept the options open' with regard to which site to buy and develop and, indeed, whether to enter the retail park business at all.

Options can also be traded. Perhaps the option to buy could be sold to another company keener to develop a particular site than the original option purchaser. It may be sold for much more than the original £10,000 option premium, even before planning permission has been granted.

Once planning permission has been granted the greenfield site may be worth £1.5 million. If there is an option to buy at £1 million the option right has an intrinsic value of £500,000, representing a 4,900 per cent return on £10,000. From this we can see the gearing effect of options: very large sums can be gained in a short period of time for a small initial cash outlay.

## Share options

Share options have been traded for centuries but their use expanded dramatically with the creation of traded option markets in Chicago, Amsterdam and, in 1978, the London Traded Options Market. In 1992 this became part of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE). Euronext bought LIFFE in 2002, which later combined with the New York Stock Exchange, so LIFFE is now called NYSE Liffe.

A share call option gives the purchaser a right, but not the obligation, to buy a fixed number of shares at a specified price at some time in the future. In the case of traded options on NYSE Liffe, one option contract relates to a quantity of 1,000 shares. The seller of the option, who receives the premium, is referred to as the writer. The writer of a call option is obligated to sell the agreed quantity of shares at the agreed price sometime in the future. American-style options can be exercised by the buyer at any time up to the expiry date, whereas European-style options can be exercised only on a predetermined future date. Just to confuse everybody, the distinction has nothing to do with geography: most options traded in Europe are American-style options.

## Call option holder (call option buyer)

Now let us examine the call options available on an underlying share – AstraZeneca on 17 December 2010. There are a number of options available for this share, many of which are not reported in the table presented in the Financial Times. A section of this table is reproduced as Exhibit 11.1. These are American-style options.

Exhibit 11.1 Call options on AstraZeneca shares, 17 December 2010

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Call option prices (premiums) pence</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise price</td><td>December</td><td>January</td><td>February</td></tr><tr><td>2900p</td><td>41</td><td>94.5</td><td>101.5</td></tr><tr><td>3000p</td><td>-</td><td>41</td><td>52.5</td></tr><tr><td>Share price on 17 December 2010 = 2941p</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Source: Financial Times, 18/19 December 2010. Reprinted with permission.

So, what do the figures mean? If you wished to obtain the right to buy 1,000 shares on or before late January 2011, $^{2}$  at an exercise price of  $3000\mathrm{p}$ , you would pay a premium of  $\mathbb{\pounds}410$  ( $1,000 \times 41\mathrm{p}$ ). If you wished to keep your option to purchase open for another month you could select the February call. But this right to insist that the writer sells the shares at the fixed price of  $3000\mathrm{p}$  on or before a date in late February will cost another  $\mathbb{\pounds}115$  (the total premium payable on one option contract =  $\mathbb{\pounds}525$ ). This extra  $\mathbb{\pounds}115$  represents additional time value. Time value arises because of the potential for the market price of the underlying to change in a way that creates intrinsic value.

The intrinsic value of an option is the payoff that would be received if the underlying were at its current level when the option expires. In this case, there is currently (17 December 2010) no intrinsic value because the right to buy is at  $3000\mathrm{p}$  whereas the share price is  $2941\mathrm{p}$ . However, if you look at a call option with an exercise price of  $2900\mathrm{p}$  then the right to buy at  $2900\mathrm{p}$  has intrinsic value because if you purchased at  $2900\mathrm{p}$  by exercising the option, thereby obtaining 1,000 shares, you could immediately sell at  $2941\mathrm{p}$  in the share market: intrinsic value  $= 41\mathrm{p}$  per share, or £410 for 1,000 shares. The longer the time over which the option is exercisable, the greater the chance that the price will move to give intrinsic value – this explains the higher premiums on more distant expiry options. Time value is the amount by which the option premium exceeds the intrinsic value.

The two exercise price (also called strike price) levels presented in Exhibit 11.1 illustrate an in-the-money option (the 2900 call option) and an out-of-the-money option (the 3000 call option). The underlying share price is above the strike price of 2900 and so this call option has an intrinsic value of  $41\mathrm{p}$  and is therefore in-the-money. The right to buy at  $3000\mathrm{p}$  is out-of-the-money because the share price is below the option exercise price and therefore has no intrinsic value. The holder of a  $3000\mathrm{p}$  option would not exercise this right to buy at  $3000\mathrm{p}$  because the shares can be bought on the stock exchange for  $2941\mathrm{p}$ . (It is sometimes possible to buy an at-the-money option, which is one where the market share price is equal to the option exercise price.)

To emphasise the key points: the option premiums vary in proportion to the length of time over which the option is exercisable (e.g. they are higher for a February option than for a January option). Also, call options with lower exercise prices will have higher premiums.

## An illustration

Suppose that you are confident that AstraZeneca shares are going to rise significantly over the next two months to 3200p and you purchase a February 2900 call at 101.5 pence. The cost of this right to purchase 1,000 shares is £1015 (101.5p × 1,000 shares). If the share rises as expected then you could exercise the right to purchase the shares for a total of £29,000 and then sell these in the market for £32,000. A profit of £3,000 less £1015 = £1,985 is made before transaction costs (the brokers' fees, etc. would be in the region of £20–£50). This represents a massive 196 per cent rise before costs (£1,985/£1015).

However, the future is uncertain and the share price may not rise as expected. Let us consider two other possibilities. First, the share price may remain at 2941p throughout the life of the option. Second, the stock market may have a severe downturn and AstraZeneca shares may fall to 2700p. These possibilities are shown in Exhibit 11.2.

Exhibit 11.2 Profits and losses on the AstraZeneca February 2900 call following purchase on 17 December 2010

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Assumed share prices in February at expiry date</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3200p</td><td>2941p</td><td>2700p</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of purchasing shares by exercising the option</td><td>£29,000</td><td>£29,000</td><td>£29,000</td></tr><tr><td>Value of shares bought</td><td>£32,000</td><td>£29,410</td><td>£27,000</td></tr><tr><td>Profit from exercise of option and sale of shares in the market</td><td>£3,000</td><td>£410</td><td>Not exercised</td></tr><tr><td>Less option premium paid</td><td>£1015</td><td>£1015</td><td>£1015</td></tr><tr><td>Profit (loss) before transaction costs</td><td>£1,985</td><td>-£605</td><td>-£1015</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage return over 2 months</td><td>196\%</td><td>-60\%</td><td>-100\%</td></tr></table>

In the case of a standstill in the share price the option gradually loses its time value over the three months until, at expiry, only the intrinsic value of 41p per share remains. The fall in the share price to 2700p illustrates one of the advantages of purchasing options over some other derivatives: the holder has a right to abandon the option and is not forced to buy the underlying share at the option exercise price – this saves £2,000. It would have added insult to injury to have to buy at £29,000 and sell at £27,000 after having already lost £1015 on the premium for the purchase of the option. A comparison of Exhibits 11.3 and 11.4 shows the extent to which the purchase of an option gears up the return from share price movements: a wider dispersion of returns is experienced. On 17 December 2010, 1,000 shares could be bought for £29,410. If the market value rose to £32,000, an 8.8 per cent return would be made, compared with a 196 per cent return if options are bought. We would all like the higher positive return on the option than the lower one available on the underlying – but would we all accept the downside risk associated with this option? Consider the following possibilities:

- If share price remains at 2941p:
- Return if shares are bought:  $0\%$ .
- Return if one 2900 February call option is bought: -60 per cent (paid £1015 for the option which declines to its intrinsic value of only £410 $^4$ ).
- If share price falls to 2700p:
- Return if shares are bought:  $-8.2\%$ .
- Return if one 2900 February call option is bought: -100 per cent (the option is worth nothing).

Profit and loss if one 2900 February call option contract (for 1,000 shares) in AstraZeneca bought on 17 December 2010 and held to maturity

The holder of the call option will not exercise unless the share price is at least  $2900\mathrm{p}$ : at a lower price it will be cheaper to buy the 1,000 shares on the stock market. Break-even does not occur until a price of  $3001.5\mathrm{p}$  because of the need to cover the cost of the premium  $(2900\mathrm{p} + 101.5\mathrm{p})$ . However, at higher prices the option value increases, penny for penny, with the share price. Also the downside risk is limited to the size of the option premium.

## Call option writers

The returns position for the writer of a call option in AstraZeneca can also be presented in a diagram (see Exhibit 11.5). With all these examples note that there is an assumption that the position is held to expiry.

If the market price is less than the exercise price (2900p) in February the option will not be exercised and the call writer profits to the extent of the option premium (101.5p per share). A market price greater than the exercise price will result in the option being exercised and the writer will be forced to deliver 1,000 shares for a price of 2900p. This may mean buying shares on the stock market to supply to the option holder. As the share price rises this becomes increasingly onerous and losses mount. Note that in the sophisticated traded option markets of today very few option positions are held to expiry. In most cases the option holder sells the option in the market to make a cash profit or loss. Option writers often cancel out their exposure before expiry – for example they could purchase an option to buy the same quantity of shares at the same price and expiry date.

Profit and loss to a call option writer of one 2900 February call option contract (for 1,000 shares) in AstraZeneca on 17 December 2010

## An example of an option-writing strategy

Joe has a portfolio of shares worth £100,000 and is confident that while the market will go up steadily over time it will not rise over the next few months. He has a strategy of writing out-of-the-money (i.e. no intrinsic value) call options and pocketing premiums on a regular basis. Today (17 December 2010) Joe has written one option on February calls in AstraZeneca for an exercise price of 2900p (current share price 2941p). In other words, Joe is committed to delivering (selling) 1,000 shares at any time between 17 December 2010 and near the end of February 2011 for a price of £29 at the insistence of the person who bought the call. This could be very unpleasant for Joe if the market price rises to, say, £33. Then the option holder will require Joe to sell shares worth £33,000 to him/her for only £29,000.

However, Joe is prepared to take this risk for two reasons. First he receives the premium of 101.5p per share up front – this is 3.5 per cent of each share's value. This £1015 will cushion any feeling of future regret at his actions. Second, Joe holds 1,000 AstraZeneca shares in his portfolio and so would not need to go into the market to buy the shares to then sell them to the option holder if the price did rise significantly. Joe has written a covered call option – so called because he has backing in the form of the underlying shares. Joe loses out only if the share price on the day the option is exercised is greater than the strike price (£29) plus the premium (£1.015). He is prepared to risk losing some of the potential upside (above  $2900\mathrm{p} + 101.5\mathrm{p} = 3001.5$ ) to gain the premium. He also reduces his loss on the downside: if the shares in his portfolio fall he has the premium as a cushion.

Some speculators engage in uncovered (naked) option writing. It is possible to lose a multiple of your current resources if you write many option contracts and the price moves against you. Imagine that Joe had only £20,000 in savings and entered the options market by writing 40 AstraZeneca February 2011 2900 calls receiving a premium of £1.015 × 40 × 1,000 = £40,600. If the price moves to £33 Joe has to buy shares for £33 and then sell them to the option holders for £29, a loss of £4 per share: £4 × 40 × 1,000 = £160,000. Despite receiving the premiums Joe has wiped out his savings.

## Liffe share options

The Financial Times lists more than 50 companies' shares in which options are traded – see Exhibit 11.6, which shows some option prices for 17 December 2010, including that of AstraZeneca. This table is a cut down version of the data available at www.euronext.com, where over 250 company options are traded through the day. Also a wider variety of strike prices is shown at www.euronext.com than the Financial Times can accommodate.

## Put options

A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific quantity of shares on or before a specified date at a fixed exercise price.

Imagine you are pessimistic about the prospects for Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, on 17 December 2010. You could purchase, for a premium of  $12.75\mathrm{p}$  per share (  $\text{£} 127.5$  in total), the right to sell 1,000 shares in or before late February 2011 at  $370\mathrm{p}$  (see Exhibit 11.6). If a fall in price subsequently takes place, to, say,  $340\mathrm{p}$ , you can insist on exercising the right to sell at  $370\mathrm{p}$ . The writer of the put option is obliged to purchase shares at  $370\mathrm{p}$  while being aware that the put holder is able to buy shares at  $340\mathrm{p}$  on the stock exchange. The option holder makes a profit of  $370 - 340 - 12.75 = 17.25\mathrm{p}$  per share ( $£172.50$ ), a 135 per cent return (before costs of  $\text{£} 20 - \text{£} 40$ ).

For the put option holder, if the market price exceeds the exercise price, it will not be wise to exercise as shares can be sold for a higher price on the Stock Exchange. Therefore the maximum loss, equal to the premium paid, is incurred. The option writer gains the premium if the share price remains above the exercise price, but may incur a large loss if the market price falls significantly (see Exhibits 11.7 and 11.8).

As with calls, in most cases the option holder would take profits by selling the option on to another investor via NYSE Liffe rather than waiting to exercise at expiry.

# Using share options to reduce risk: hedging

Hedging with options is especially attractive because they can give protection against unfavourable movements in the underlying while permitting the possibility of benefiting from favourable movements. Suppose you hold 1,000 shares in Sainsbury on 17 December 2010. Your share-holding is worth £3,721 (see price in brackets underneath 'Sainsbury' in Exhibit 11.6). There are rumours flying around the market that the company may become the target of a takeover bid. If this materialises the share price will rocket; if it does not the market will be disappointed and the price will fall dramatically. What are you to do? One way to avoid the downside risk is to sell the shares. The problem is that you may regret this action if the bid does subsequently occur and you have forgone the opportunity of a large profit. An alternative approach is to retain the shares and buy a put option. This will rise in value as the share price falls. If the share price rises you gain from your underlying share holding.

Assume a 370 February put is purchased for a premium of  $127.5$  (see Exhibit 11.6). If the share price falls to  $300\mathrm{p}$  in late February you lose on your underlying shares by  $\mathcal{L}721((372.1\mathrm{p}-$ $300\mathrm{p})\times 1,000)$ . However, the put option will have an intrinsic value of  $\mathcal{L}700((370\mathrm{p} - 300\mathrm{p})\times$  1,000), thus reducing the loss and limiting the downside risk. Below  $370\mathrm{p}$ , for every 1p lost in a share price, 1p is gained on the put option, so the maximum loss is £148.5 (£21 intrinsic value + £127.5 option premium).

Thus, hedging reduces the dispersion of possible outcomes. There is a floor below which losses cannot be increased, while on the upside the benefit from any rise in share price is reduced. If the share price stands still at 372.1p, however, you may feel that the premium you paid to insure against an adverse movement at 12.75p or 3.4 per cent of the share price was excessive. If you keep buying this type of 'insurance' through the year it can reduce your portfolio returns substantially.

A simpler example of risk reduction occurs when an investor is fairly sure that a share will rise in price but is not so confident as to discount the possibility of a fall. Suppose that the investor wished to buy 10,000 shares in Diageo, currently priced at  $1180\mathrm{p}$  (on 17 December 2010) - see Exhibit 11.6. This can be achieved either by a direct purchase of shares in the market or through the purchase of an option. If the share price does fall significantly, the size of the loss is greater with the share purchase - the option loss is limited to the premium paid.

Suppose that ten February 1150 call options are purchased at a cost of  $\mathcal{E}5,500$  ( $55\mathrm{p} \times 1,000 \times 10$ ). Exhibit 11.9 shows that the option is less risky because of the ability to abandon the right to buy at  $1150\mathrm{p}$ .

Mexico wanted certainty over the amount it would gain by selling  \$13 billion of its oil on the international market in 2010, so it bought a put option - see Exhibit 11.10. Even though the cost was\$ 1 billion the government thought it well worth it, especially after it gained so much on its put options in 2009.

# Mexico buys 1bn insurance policy against falling oil prices

FT

By Gregory Meyer in New York and Javier Blas in London

Mexico has taken out a  $1bn ($ 614m) insurance policy against oil prices falling next year, a clear signal that commodities producers remain wary of the threat of a double-dip recession.

The world's sixth-largest oil producer said yesterday that it had hedged all its net oil exports - 230m barrels - for 2010 by buying protection against oil price falling below 57 a barrel.

"We want this as an insurance policy," said Agustin Carstens, Mexico's finance minister. "If we don't collect any resources from this transaction, it's OK with us." That would mean the oil price had remained above 57 a barrel, he added.

The move follows a successful hedging strategy at  \$70 this year which netted Mexico more than\$ 5bn on the back of low prices between January and June.

Although that figure is lower than expectations because of recent high oil prices, it still represents more than 7 per cent of Mexican government revenues this year.

Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley arranged this year's hedge. Bankers said Barclays Capital was leading next year's.

Mr Carstens, joined by senior executives from the banks, said Mexico's hedging showed that derivatives, "when used responsibly", could be "very useful". Mexico bought put options - contracts that give the holder the right to sell oil at a predetermined price.

His view contrasts sharply with recent comments by senior Chinese officials, who criticised some of the same banks for selling derivatives products, including oil hedges, to state companies. Many had heavy losses.

Mexico has based its budget next year on an oil price of about 59 a barrel.

Olivier Jakob, of the Swiss-based consultancy Petromatrix, said there was potential for a drop in oil prices in 2010 unless demand recovered meaningfully. "The fundamental supply and demand picture looks weak, but the weakness of the US dollar and financial flows are supporting oil prices right now," he explained.

# Index options

Options on whole share indices can be purchased: for example, Standard & Poor's 500 (US), FTSE 100 (UK), CAC 40 (France), XETRA Dax (Germany). Large investors usually have a varied portfolio of shares so, rather than hedging individual shareholdings with options, they may hedge through options on the entire index of shares. Also speculators can take a position on the future movement of the market as a whole.

A major difference between index options and share options is that the former are cash settled – so for the FTSE 100 option, there is no delivery of 100 different shares on the expiry day. Rather, a cash difference representing the price change changes hands.

Exhibit 11.11 shows the January expiry options for the FTSE 100 Index on 20 December 2010. The date of the download was 20 December and the FTSE 100 at that time was at 5,902. By convention (so everyone knows where they stand) the index is regarded as a price and each one-point movement on the index represents £10. So if you purchased one contract in January expiry 5,875 calls ('C') you would pay an option premium of 110 index points  $\times$  £10 = £1,100. The different calls and put strike prices are shown in the middle column of the table, with the call prices to the left and the put prices to the right.

Imagine that the following day, 21 December 2010, the FTSE 100 moved from its level on 20 December 2010 of 5,902 to 5,940 and the option price on the 5,875 January call moved to 150 index points (65 points of intrinsic value and 85 points of time value). To convert this into money you could sell the option at £10 per point per contract  $(150 \times £10 = £1,500)$ . In 24 hours your £1,100 has gone up to £1,500, a 36 per cent rise. Large gains can be made when the market moves in your favour. If it moves against you, large percentage losses will occur in just a few hours.

Note that there are many additional option expiry dates stretching months into the future other than the January one shown in Exhibit 11.11. In fact, there are eight months available: 'Nearest eight of March, June, September, December plus such additional months that the nearest four calendar months are always available for trading' (www.euronext.com).

# Hedging against a decline in the market using index options

An investor with an £1,175,000 broadly spread portfolio of shares is concerned that the market may fall over the next two months. One strategy to lower risk is to purchase put options on the share index. If the market does fall, losses on the portfolio will be offset by gains on the value of the index put option.

First the investor has to calculate the number of option contracts needed to hedge the underlying. With the index at 5,902 on 20 December 2010 and each point of that index settled at £10, one contract has a value of  $5,902 \times £10 = £59,020$ . To cover an £1,175,000 portfolio (£1,175,000 ÷ £59,020 = 19.9) twenty contracts are needed (investors can trade in whole contracts only). The investor opts to buy 20 January 5,850 puts for 71.50 points per contract – see Exhibit 11.11. The premium payable is:

$$
71.50 \text{points} \times £10 \times 20 = £14,300
$$

This amounts to a 1.2 per cent 'insurance premium' (£14,300/£1,175,000) against a downturn in the market.

Consider what happens if the market does fall by a large amount, say 15 per cent, between 20 December and the third Friday in January (when the option matures). The index falls from 5,902 to 5,016, and the loss on the portfolio is

$$
£1,175,000 \times 0.15 = £176,250
$$

If the portfolio is unhedged, the investor suffers from a market fall. However, in this case the put options gain in value as the index falls because they carry the right to sell at 5,850. If the investor closed the option position by buying at a level of 5,016, with the right to sell at 5,850, a 834-point difference, a gain is made :

Gain on options  $(5,850 - 5,016)\times 20\times £10 =$  £166,800

Less option premium paid 14,300

£152,500

A substantial proportion of the fall in portfolio value is compensated for through the use of the put derivative.

# Aunt Agathas and options

Millions of ordinary small investors (Aunt Agathas in the City jargon) have their money applied to the derivatives markets even though they may remain blissfully unaware that such 'exotic' transactions are being conducted on their behalf. Take the case of equity-linked bonds. Investors nervous of investing in the stock market for fear of downward swings are promised a guarantee that they will receive at least the return of their original capital, even if the stock market falls. If it rises they will receive a return linked to the rise (say the capital gain element – excluding dividends). The bulk of the capital invested in these equity-linked bonds may be placed in safe fixed-interest investments, with the stock-market-linked return created through the use of options and other derivatives. Following derivative disasters there is always some discussion over the wisdom of using such highly geared instruments. However, the financial services industry easily defends itself by pointing out the risk-reducing possibilities of these products if properly managed.

# A comparison of options, futures, forwards and FRAs

We have covered a great deal of ground in the field of derivatives. It is time to summarise the main advantages and disadvantages of the derivatives discussed so far - see Exhibit 11.12.

# Spread betting

You can bet on the future movements of shares (and other securities) in a similar way to betting on horses. If the share moves the way you said it would, you gain. However, unlike with horses, if it moves against you the loss can be a multiple of the amount you first put down – you lose money for every 1p adverse movement in a share price. So, if you bet that Marks & Spencer's share price will rise, and you punt £10 for every penny rise, if M&S increases by 30p you win £300. However, if M&S falls 30p you have to hand over £300. This is the basic principle, but the actual operation is slightly more complicated. If you believe that the price is destined to rise you will contact (by telephone, or using the internet) one of the spread betting companies. They will quote you two prices (the spread), say, 348p–352p, for M&S. The first is called the 'bid' price and is the relevant price if you are selling. The second is the 'offer' price and is the relevant price if you are buying.

Given your optimism about M&S, the relevant price is 352p. You agree to bet £10 per 1p rise in the price. You 'buy' at 352p. Now imagine that you were correct and the spread on M&S moves to 375p-379p. You can close your position by telephoning the spread dealer and 'selling' to close. The relevant price for you (betting on a rise) on the close is the lower of the two quoted: 375p. So you have made a gain of 23p (375p-352p), which translates into £230 given a bet of £10 per penny.

If you had been pessimistic about M&S when the spread quote was at 348p-352p you would have bet by 'selling' at 348p. A movement up to 375p-379p would result in a loss of 31p (379p -348p), £310 at £10 per penny. However, if the spread quote moves to 320p-324p the gain is 348p less 324p=24p (or £240 if you bet £10 per penny move).

You can see how the spread betting company can make money from the spread: you sell and buy at the least advantageous price on the spread. Presumably there are other investors doing the opposite, if you are 'buying' at  $352\mathrm{p}$  they are 'selling' at  $348\mathrm{p}$ . The spread betting company's books are balanced but a 4p gain is made. The size of these spreads varies depending on volume of trade and degree of competition between spread betting firms, but they are larger than the market makers' spreads on the underlying shares.

# Money up-front

The bookmaker (spread betting company) will require you to demonstrate that you are able to pay should the bet go against you. When you lay a bet you will be asked for a sum of money called the notional trading requirement or 'margin', or 'deposit'. This will obviously be a larger sum if you are betting £10 per penny (point) rather than £5 per penny (point) movement in the underlying share (or index), or if the share (or index) is particularly volatile.

Furthermore, if the bet starts to go against you and the position is held open over a number of days you will be asked to top up the funds deposited with the spread betting company through margin calls. Naturally, these will be returned to you if there are moves in your favour.

Imagine you placed an 'up bet' on Vodafone when the spread quote is  $103p - 104p$ . You therefore 'buy' at  $104p$ , betting  $\mathbb{£}100$  per penny movement. The maximum possible loss occurs when Vodafone goes to zero:  $104p$  loss at  $\mathbb{£}100$  per penny is equal to  $\mathbb{£}10,400$ . The spread betting company requires 10 per cent of this maximum loss (in this particular case), so you deposit  $\mathbb{£}1,040$ .[11] If the Vodafone spread falls by  $5p$  to  $98p - 99p$  the next day, your account will be debited  $\mathbb{£}500$  ( $5 \times \mathbb{£}100 = \mathbb{£}500$ ). The spread betting company then asks you to top up your account by paying an additional margin of  $\mathbb{£}500$ . For the next two weeks Vodafone oscillates greatly. On some days your account is credited, on others you are asked for more margin through 'cash calls'. After 14 days you close your position by telephoning the spread betting company and telling the dealer that you would like to sell Vodafone 'to close'. It is important to make it clear that you are not selling Vodafone 'to open' as that means a fresh separate bet on Vodafone falling.

The spread quoted is  $108\mathrm{p -109p}$ . You have gained  $\mathbb{£}400$  (sold at  $108\mathrm{p}$  and bought at  $104\mathrm{p}$ , i.e. a  $4\mathrm{p}$  rise at  $\mathbb{£}100$  per penny). This is a good return on an initial cash injection of  $\mathbb{£}1,040$  (plus a few cash calls during the two weeks). However, the potential risk of it all going wrong was also very high.

An alternative to betting and then being subject to a series of cash calls is to place a 'stop-loss' at the time of the bet. Under a stop-loss the spread betting company closes your position for you if the underlying share moves to the stated stop-loss price. At the time that you place the bet you hand over margin to the spread betting company equal to the maximum loss that could occur should the stop-loss be triggered. For example, if you make an up bet on Pearson when the spread quote is 780p-800p at £10 per penny and you set a stop-loss at 640p (i.e. 20 per cent below the bet level) the maximum loss if the stop-loss is triggered is  $160 \times £10 = £1,600$ , so you will be asked to provide £1,600 of margin. This cash may already be in a special account opened when you registered with the spread betting company, or could be transferred by debit card over the telephone.

There are two types of stop-loss order. A 'standard' stop-loss is one where the company will try to close your position, but if the market is falling like a stone it may not be able to close it before the market price has zoomed past the stop-loss limit. With a 'guaranteed' ('controlled risk') stop-loss the spread betting company will close at the agreed stop-loss price even if the market price has moved beyond this before they were able to act. To have a guarantee you will have to pay a wider spread at the time that the bet is placed. A standard stop-loss does not require a wider spread.

# Types of bet

There are three types of share or index bet. An intraday (cash or spot) bet is one that starts and is closed in the same trading day. A futures-based bet is one on the price of shares (index) on the next quarter day or the one after that (quarter days are in late March, June, September and December). So in the above Vodafone example the spread quotes would have been based on the future price for a Vodafone share on the next quarter day.[12] This price is made by the spread betting company but cannot deviate too far from prices in the market place (otherwise arbitrageurs will be given an invitation to make money risk-free by doing opposite transactions in the market and with spread betting companies).

Traditionally, futures-based betting was the way to spread a bet over a few days or weeks. However, spread betting companies have now introduced rolling cash spread betting (rolling daily bets). The spread better 'rolls' their position overnight to the next day.

# Uses of spread betting

Spread betting can be used as a kind of insurance. For example, when you hold the underlying shares and you think it possible that the price will fall substantially in the short term, but a potential capital gains tax causes you to hesitate in selling the underlying shares, you could place a bet such that you gain if the share price falls. You will stabilise your position: if the share falls your portfolio declines but you win (an equal amount) on the bet; if the share rises you gain on the portfolio but lose on the bet. You can then select the time when you sell the shares – it might be good to wait a few months until the next tax year when you can use your annual capital gains tax allowance.

Spread betting can also be used to take highly leveraged positions where a small movement in the underlying leads to a large percentage gain on the amount initially committed to the bet – as in the Vodafone example.

Finally, spread betting allows you to gain from share (index) falls. You are restricted from shorting shares – selling shares you don't own in anticipation of closing your position by buying the same quantity at a lower price later – in the stock market, but spread betting makes this easy, at least for movements over a few months.

# Further points
- In addition to spread betting on shares and share indices, you can spread-bet commodities, bonds, interest rates, currencies, futures, options, house prices and even the outcomes of sporting events.
- Most spread betting companies quote about 400 companies online, but will give you quotes on many more (smaller ones) if you phone.
- The spreads are at the discretion of the spread betting firm – when you ask for prices do not reveal whether you are a potential buyer or a seller.
Even when the equity markets are closed spread bets can be made.

# Contracts for difference

Trading in contracts for difference (CFDs) is very similar to spread betting. However, with CFDs there is no settlement date – your open position can continue until you choose to close it (or it is closed for you because you have failed to provide margin).

In a CFD contract the buyer and seller agree to pay, in cash, at the closing of the contract, the difference between the opening and closing price of the underlying shares, multiplied by the number of shares in the contract.[13]

For example, imagine that you have a deposit account with a CFD broker. You have placed 20,000 in this account. You are pessimistic about Vodafone's shares and ask for a price quote from the broker. She replies with: '102 bid and 103 offer.' You agree to sell CFDs for 160,000 shares in Vodafone at a price of 102p. Note that with the amount of cash you have (20,000) you would not be able to purchase this many shares. It is because the CFD brokers permit trading on margins of around 10-20 per cent that you can leverage up the use of the 20,000. If we assume that the CFD broker requires 10 per cent as margin then just over 16,000 of the deposit money will now be held as margin (and not simply as a deposit), leaving you with just under 4,000 as free equity. It is good to have some free equity as you might have to meet margin calls if the price starts to move against you. If the shares now fall to 92 bid and 93 offer you will be showing a gain on your margin account of 102\mathrm{p} - 93\mathrm{p} = 9\mathrm{p} per share, or 14,400. If you close your position your deposit account will then contain the original 20,000 plus 14,400.

On the other hand if Vodafone's share price moves to  $113\mathrm{p} - 114\mathrm{p}$  you lose and the CFD broker will require additional margin. If you close your position at this point your loss will be  $114\mathrm{p} - 102\mathrm{p} = 12\mathrm{p}$  per share or  $0.12 \times 160,000 = £19,200$ .

# Additional points
- Some brokers quote a narrower spread, but then charge up to 0.25 per cent of the trade value on both the opening and closing transactions.
- Stop-losses can be set up, freeing you from monitoring the market every minute to avoid big losses, as your position is automatically closed if the market goes against you.
- When you sell a CFD as your opening position any dividend due during your period of ownership will be taken from your margin account. Those with a buy ('long') position will receive a payment equivalent to the net dividend.
- If you take a long position (buy) the CFD trader will charge you interest during the period of holding the CFD (typically LIBOR plus 2–3 per cent). If you are a long-term holder CFDs are expensive – buy the underlying. If you sell (go short), interest will be added to your account (typically 2–3 per cent below LIBOR).
- The right to vote at AGMs, etc. is usually not conferred to the CFD holder (although the CFD provider may facilitate the clients wishes, e.g. voting on a merger, in some cases).
- CFDs are available on most shares, right down to market capitalisations of £10 million.
- You must carefully monitor your position on a day-to-day basis if you do not have a stop-loss, as you may have to meet margin calls and/or close out positions.

# Caps

An interest rate cap is a contract that gives the purchaser the right effectively to set a maximum level for interest rates payable. Compensation is paid to the purchaser of a cap if interest rates rise above an agreed level. This is a hedging technique used to cover interest rate risk on longer-term borrowing (usually 2-5 years). Under these arrangements a company borrowing money can benefit from interest rate falls but can place a limit to the amount paid in interest should interest rates rise.

# Worked example 11.1 Interest rate cap

Oakham plc wishes to borrow £20 million for five years. It arranges this with Bank A at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus 1.5 per cent. The interest rate is reset every quarter based on three-month LIBOR. Currently this stands at an annual rate of 3 per cent. The firm is concerned that over a five-year period the interest rate could rise to a dangerous extent.

Oakham buys an interest rate cap set at LIBOR of 4.5 per cent from Bank B. For the sake of argument we will assume that this costs 2.3 per cent of the principal amount, or  $£20\mathrm{m} \times 0.023 = £460,000$  payable immediately to the cap seller. If over the subsequent five years LIBOR rises above 4.5 per cent in any three-month period Oakham will receive sufficient compensation from the cap seller to offset exactly any extra interest above 4.5 per cent. So if for the whole of the third year LIBOR rose to 5.5 per cent Oakham would pay interest at 5.5 per cent plus 1.5 per cent to bank A but would also receive 1 per cent compensation from the cap seller (a quarter every three months), thus capping the interest payable. If interest rates fall, Oakham benefits by paying Bank A less.

The premium (£460,000) payable up front covers the buyer for the entire five years, with no further payment due.

Caps are usually arranged for amounts of £5 million or more, but can be for underlyings of only 1 million – but when they are this low it may be difficult to obtain competing cost quotes from the banks. It is up to the client to select the strike rate and whether the rollover frequency (when LIBOR is compared with the strike) will be, say, three months or six months. They are available in all the main currencies.

The size of the cap premium depends on the difference between current interest rates and the level at which the cap becomes effective; the length of time covered; and the expected volatility of interest rates. The cap seller does not need to assess the creditworthiness of the purchaser because it receives payment of the premium in advance. Thus, a cap is particularly suitable for highly geared firms, such as leveraged buyouts.

# Floors and collars

Buyers of interest rate caps are sometimes keen to reduce the large cash payment at the outset. They can do this by simultaneously selling a floor, which results in a counterparty paying a premium. With a floor, if the interest rate falls below an agreed level, the seller (the floor writer) makes compensatory payments to the floor buyer. These payments are determined by the difference between the prevailing rates and the floor rate.

Returning to Oakham, the treasurer could buy a cap set at 4.5 per cent LIBOR for a premium of £460,000 and sell a floor at 2 per cent LIBOR receiving, say, £200,000. In any three-month period over the five-year life of the loan, if LIBOR rose above 4.5 per cent the cap seller would pay compensation to Oakham; if LIBOR fell below 2 per cent Oakham would save on the amount paid to Bank A but will have to make payments to the floor buyer, thus restricting the benefits from falls in LIBOR. Oakham, for a net premium of £260,000, has ensured that its effective interest payments will not diverge from the range 2 per cent +1.5 per cent = 3.5 per cent at the lower end, to 4.5 per cent +1.5 per cent = 6 per cent at the upper end.

The combination of selling a floor at a low strike rate and buying a cap at a higher strike rate is called a collar.

Exhibit 11.13 describes a cap for mortgage holders. (Trackers are mortgages that go up and down with bank base rates. SVR=the lender's standard variable rate, which is also a floating rate of interest.)

Wealthy homeowners could find it easier to hedge their loans against future interest rate rises following the launch of a new insurance product, designed for borrowers with larger mortgages.

John Charcol, the mortgage adviser, launched The Interest Rate Protector this week, an interest rate capping product backed by a high street bank, which protects residential and buy-to-let borrowers from rising rates.

While there are already a few products on the market designed to help borrowers protect themselves against rate jumps - including one from Marketguard and a product on offer by Savills Private Finance - mortgage brokers said the new deal would boost competition in the market and provide more protection for borrowers.

"While interest rates have been low for many months, there is only one way they can move, which is upwards," said Melanie Bien, director of mortgage broker Private Finance. "What nobody knows is when. With this uncertainty, it is understandable why those on cheap tracker mortgages want to enjoy low rates for as long as possible, perhaps with some protection built in, in the form of a cap."

Charcoal's product is aimed at borrowers who are not on fixed rate deals - who make up roughly 50 per cent of the market - and more specifically those on cheap lifetime trackers or SVRs.

The cost of buying the cap varies daily with market conditions. The minimum cover that can be purchased is 500,000 and the unit cost falls as the loan size increases. For example, a five-year cap for 500,000 of cover costs around of 17,500 for a cap at 3 per cent Bank of England base rate, 14,000 for a cap at 4 per cent and \$12,000 for a cap at 5 per cent. Cover for a 1m mortgage would be around 30,000, 23,000 and \$19,000 respectively.

If the bank rate rises above the chosen cap level, then Charcol makes monthly payments to cover the difference between that level and bank rate either until the end of the insured term or until the bank rate falls back below the chosen level.

"Unless you're the proud owner of a crystal ball, knowing what the future for interest rates looks like is all but impossible," says Ray Boulger at John Charcol. "Thus many borrowers face a challenging judgement call if they decide they want some protection. Those paying under 1 per cent - as some on the cheapest lifetime trackers are - would see their rate at least quadruple if they moved to a five or 10-year fixed rate."

The deal could also appeal to buy-to-let investors who are stuck on trackers and standard variable rate mortgages because of high gearing and/or inadequate rental income to meet lenders' current criteria.

But some brokers said that while the capped product gives protection, the fees are a lot to pay upfront. "The concept is good and it is great to see innovation in this market," says David Hollingworth at London and Country Mortgages. "But the premium is quite high so it is unlikely to be an option for the mass market."

# Swaps

A swap is an exchange of cash payment obligations. An interest-rate swap is where one company arranges with a counterparty to exchange interest-rate payments. For example, the first company may be paying fixed-rate interest but prefers to pay floating rates. The second company may be paying floating rates of interest, which go up and down with LIBOR, but would benefit from a switch to a fixed obligation. Imagine that firm S has a  $200\mathrm{m}$  ten-year loan paying a fixed rate of interest of 8 per cent, and firm T has a  $\mathbb{£}200$  million ten-year loan on which interest is reset every six months with reference to LIBOR, at LIBOR plus 2 per cent. Under a swap arrangement S would agree to pay T's floating-rate interest on each due date over the next ten years, and T would be obligated to pay S's 8 per cent interest.

One motive for entering into a swap arrangement is to reduce or eliminate exposure to rises in interest rates. Over the short run, futures, options and FRAs could be used to hedge interest-rate exposure. However, for longer-term loans (more than two years) swaps are usually more suitable because they can run for the entire lifetime of the loan. So if a treasurer of a company with a large floating-rate loan forecasts that interest rates will rise over the next four years, they could arrange to swap interest payments with a fixed-rate interest payer for those four years.

Another reason for using swaps is to take advantage of market imperfections. Sometimes the interest-rate risk premium charged in the fixed-rate borrowing market differs from that in the floating-rate market for a particular borrower. See worked example 11.2.

# Worked example 11.2 Swaps

Take the two companies, Cat plc and Dog plc, both of which want to borrow £150m for eight years. Cat would like to borrow on a fixed-rate basis because this would better match its asset position. Dog prefers to borrow at floating rates because of optimism about future interest-rate falls. The treasurers of each firm have obtained quotations from banks operating in the markets for both fixedand floating-rate eight-year debt. Cat could obtain fixed-rate borrowing at 10 per cent and floating rate at LIBOR +2 per cent. Dog is able to borrow at 8 per cent fixed and LIBOR +1 per cent floating:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Fixed</td><td>Floating</td></tr><tr><td>Cat can borrow at</td><td>10\%</td><td>LIBOR + 2\%</td></tr><tr><td>Dog can borrow at</td><td>8\%</td><td>LIBOR + 1\%</td></tr></table>

In the absence of a swap market Cat would probably borrow at 10 per cent and Dog would pay LIBOR + 1 per cent. However, with a swap arrangement both firms can achieve lower interest rates.

Notice that because of Dog's higher credit rating it can borrow at a lower rate than Cat in both the fixedand the floating-rate market - it has an absolute advantage in both. However the risk premium charged in the two markets is not consistent. Cat has to pay an extra 1 per cent in the floating-rate market, but an extra 2 per cent in the fixed-rate market. Cat has an absolute disadvantage for both, but has a comparative advantage in the floating-rate market.

To achieve lower interest rates each firm should borrow in the market where it has comparative advantage and then swap interest obligations. So Cat borrows floating-rate funds, paying LIBOR +2 per cent, and Dog borrows fixed-rate debt, paying 8 per cent.

Then they agree to swap interest payments at rates which lead to benefits for both firms in terms of: (a) achieving the most appropriate interest pattern (fixed or floating), and (b) the interest rate that is payable, which is lower than if Cat had borrowed at fixed and Dog had borrowed at floating rates. One way of achieving this is to arrange the swap on the following basis:

- Cat pays to Dog fixed interest of 9.5 per cent;
Dog pays to Cat LIBOR +2 per cent.

This is illustrated in Exhibit 11.14.

# Exhibit 11.14 An interest rate swap

Now let us examine the position for each firm.

Cat pays LIBOR +2 per cent to a bank but also receives LIBOR +2 per cent from Dog and so these two cancel out. Cat also pays 9.5 per cent fixed to Dog. This is 50 basis points (0.5 per cent) lower than if Cat had borrowed at fixed rate directly from the bank. On £150m this is worth £750,000 per year.

# Cat:

Pays LIBOR +2\%

Receives LIBOR +2\%

Pays Fixed  $9.5\%$

Net payment Fixed  $9.5\%$

Dog takes on the obligation of paying a bank fixed interest at 8 per cent while receiving 9.5 per cent fixed from Cat on the regular payment days. The net effect is 1.5 per cent receivable less the Libor +2 per cent payment to Cat – a floating-rate liability of Libor +0.5 per cent.

# Dog:

Pays Fixed  $8\%$

Receives Fixed  $9.5\%$

Pays LIBOR +2\%

Net payment LIBOR  $+0.5\%$

Again there is a saving of 50 basis points or £750,000 per year.[16] The net annual £1.5m saving is before transaction costs.

Prior to the widespread development of a highly liquid swap market each counterparty incurred considerable expense in making the contracts watertight. Even then, the risk of one of the counterparties failing to fulfil its obligations was a potential problem. Today intermediaries (for example, banks) take counterparty positions in swaps and this reduces risk and avoids the necessity for one corporation to search for another with a corresponding swap preference. The intermediary generally finds an opposite counterparty for the swap at a later date. Furthermore, standardised contracts reduce the time and effort needed to arrange a swap and have permitted the development of a thriving secondary market, and this has assisted liquidity. This more developed approach, with a bank intermediary offering rates to swap fixed to floating, or floating to fixed is illustrated in worked example 11.3.

# Worked example 11.3 Swaps with an intermediary bank

Paris Expori, a French property developer, has agreed to buy and develop a shopping centre in the heart of England. It will need to borrow  $£80m$  to do this for a period of six years. The company treasurer has contacted a number of banks to enquire what they would charge if a term loan was granted by them. The quotes are for both floating (LIBOR related) rates and fixed rates. She has also looked into the possibilities of issuing a floating rate bond with the interest re-fixed to LIBOR at six-month intervals and the issuance of a fixed interest rate bond. She has concluded that all the fixed rates offered are excessively high - each quote is over 5.5 per cent. The best floating rate offer is a reasonable LIBOR +200 basis points, but the board of directors insist that, because the company already has too much exposure to a rise in interest rates, such a large loan should not add to the company's exposure.

The Treasurer's solution is to borrow  $£80m$  at floating rate and then contact one of banks offering swap rates to swap into a fixed rate. The date is 16 December 2010 and an idea of the swap rates available are shown in the Financial Times table displayed in Exhibit 11.15 – in reality you need to contact brokers and individual banks.

For this illustration we are most interested in the pound sterling columns (£ Stlg). Two prices are given for each contract period. The ask rate is the interest you would pay under the swap if you were to pay fixed rate and receive the LIBOR rate set for each of the six months over the term of the agreement with the bank doing swap. The bid rate is the fixed rate you would receive from the bank in return for you paying LIBOR to it. The banks in these markets expect to conclude numerous deals both paying fixed and receiving fixed rates, and they make a few basis points of profit between the two.

Paris Expori must ensure that any deal it makes with a bank in the swap market matches the underlying floating rate loan transaction it has concluded with another bank – e.g. length of time to maturity, dates of resetting interest rates ('rollover dates'). The deal it wants to make in the swap market is to pay fixed rate and receive floating rate. Looking along the six-year row we see that the fixed rate payable is 3.08 per cent per annum if Paris Expori is a top ranking company. However, it is not regarded as a counterparty as safe as one of these banks and so it will have to pay slightly more, say 3.15 per cent. This rate will be paid semi-annually – roughly one-half of 3.15 per cent for six months. In return Paris Expori will receive six-month LIBOR, which will be reset for each six-month period depending on market rates at the time.

Thus, on each of the six-monthly rollover dates the LIBOR rate of interest will be deducted from the agreed fixed rate of 3.15 and the difference paid by one party to the other. For example, if six months after the agreement starts LIBOR is set at 1.00 per cent (expressed as an annual rate) at the 11 a.m. London fixing, Paris Expori owes 3.15 per cent to the bank (which needs adjusting down for the six-month period) while the bank owes Paris Expori 1.00 per cent (halve that for the six months). Rather than make two payments, only the difference changes hands: 2.15 per cent (half that for six months) – see Exhibit 11.16.

Exhibit 11.16 Paris Expori's swap flows

Paris Expori is now receiving LIBOR to offset the payment of LIBOR it makes to the bank that lent it £80 million. However, it has to pay 200 basis points more than this to the lending bank as well as the fixed rate of 3.15 per cent per annum, thus it has fixed its interest at 5.15 per cent for the six year life of the loan. This is better than the 5.5 per cent offered as a direct fixed rate loan to the company.

A practical use of a swap arrangement by an individual is shown in Exhibit 11.17. The mortgage holder starts by paying base rate plus 1 per cent to the mortgage company  $(5.5\% + 1\%)$  but agrees a swap whereby he pays 6.2 fixed rate and receives base rate.

# Exhibit 11.17

# Rate rise is music to the ears of 'swappers'

Unlike many home owners, those who have taken out interest rate swaps will be hoping that the Bank of England raises interest rates sooner rather than later.

One client of Stonehenge, which advises wealthy families, recently arranged an interest rate swap on his  $5\mathrm{m}$  mortgage for three years. Due to the size of the loan he had to take out a variable mortgage at a rate of 6.5 per cent. Convinced that interest rates will increase significantly over the next three years he was concerned that his variable rate left him vulnerable to the possibility of large and changeable repayments.

He decided to take out a swap, which effectively takes the cost of his mortgage to 7.2 per cent. This meant taking out a 3 year swap priced at 6.2 per cent, 0.7 of a percentage point above base rates of current base rates of 5.5 per cent.

If base rates go above his swap rate of 6.2 per cent, the bank will pay him the difference between his fixed rate and the interest rate, effectively insuring him against further interest rate hikes. If base rates stay below this level he pays out the difference.

The benefits come if the Bank of England raises rates higher. If rates rise to 6.5 per cent, say, his variable mortgage would jump to 7.5 per cent and each year he would need to pay £375,000. While rising interest rates will push up his variable rate, they will also push up the amount he receives back from his bank on his swap.

In this case he would get back the difference between his swap rate of 6.2 per cent and the interest rate of 6.5 per cent. He can then use this 0.3 per cent payment of 7.5 per cent, keeping his payments at a fixed rate of 7.2 per cent.

But by using an interest rate swap, he has ensured that his payments never exceed 7.2 per cent - or 360,000 per year.

There are many variations on the swaps theme. For example, a swaption is an option to have a swap at a later date. In a currency swap the two parties exchange interest obligations (or receipts) and (usually) the principal amount for an agreed period, between two different currencies. On reaching the maturity date of the swap the principal amounts will be re-exchanged at a pre-agreed exchange rate. An example of such an arrangement is shown in Exhibit 11.18.

# TVA, EIB find winning formula

The back-to-back swap deal priced yesterday for the Tennessee Valley Authority and the European Investment Bank will give both cheaper funding than they could obtain through conventional bond issuance.

TVA, the US government-owned power utility, is issuing a 10-year DM1.5bn eurobond with a Frankfurt listing, while EIB is raising 1bn with a 10-year issue in the US market. The issuers will swap the proceeds.

Speaking in London yesterday, the treasurers of both organisations said the arrangement - now relatively unusual in the swaps market

- had allowed them to reduce borrowing costs, although they did not specify by what amount.

Two elements of the deal were important in this respect. First, the EIB has a much stronger comparative advantage over TVA in funding in dollars than it does in D-Marks. Lehman Brothers, co-bookrunner on both deals, said the EIB priced its 10-year dollar paper at 17 basis points over Treasuries, about 6 to 7 points lower than TVA could have done.

In the German market EIB enjoys a smaller advantage; it could raise funds at about 4 basis points less than the 17 points over bonds achieved by TVA.

Second, by swapping the proceeds on a back-to-back basis rather than through counterparties, bid/offer spreads were eliminated and transaction costs reduced.

Resulting savings were pooled, providing benefits for both borrowers.

Both also diversified their funding sources. Lehman said some 65 per cent of the TVA bonds were placed in Europe, 20 per cent in Asia, and 15 per cent in the US. About half the EIB issue was placed in the US, 35 per cent in Europe, and 15 per cent in Asia.

# Milan swaps case puts banks in the hot seat

# Vincent Boland

If any European country was going to be a test bed for the raging global debate on the use of complex derivatives, it was Italy.

Not only is the country, at the sovereign level, one of the eurozone's most indebted nations (with a debt-to-GDP ratio that the Italian finance ministry estimates will be 116.9 per cent this year) it also has heavily indebted local authorities, where the ticking time bombs are really located.

This week one of those time bombs erupted. A judge in Milan on Wednesday levelled charges of fraud against four international banks – Deutsche Bank, Germany's Depfa, UBS, and JPMorgan – and ordered 11 bankers and two former municipal employees to stand trial for their roles in a complex and controversial €1.7bn (2.3bn) bond issue that the city claims has hurt it financially.

Alfredo Robledo, the Milan chief prosecutor, sounded almost tentative in his summing up of the seriousness of the case against the banks when the judge's ruling was issued.

"It is [at] a delicate stage," he said of the investigation process he has been spearheading for the past three years into the circumstances of the bond issue and an accompanying swaps transaction that is at the centre of the fraud allegations.

It suggests a level of defiance, or brinkmanship, among all the parties involved: on the part of the city, that its accusation that it has been hurt to the tune of at least  €56m  and possibly more, can be proven; and on the part of the banks that no fraud was committed and that the case is baseless.

The four banks insisted on Wednesday that their employees did nothing wrong. JPMorgan said they acted "with the highest degree of professionalism and entirely appropriately", a sentiment echoed by the others.

The two former municipal officials are Giorgio Porta, a former general manager of the office of the mayor of Milan, and Mauro Mauri, a financial adviser to the city. Both men deny any wrong-doing. Gabriele Albertini, the former Milan mayor who was in office when the bond issue was launched, says he has "the highest trust" in the two men. He also defends the decision to restructure the city's debt profile, of which the bond issue and the swaps agreement that accompanied it were part, arguing that it saved the city €198m over four years.

The transaction, on the face of it, was a fairly straightforward one. The city hired the four banks to underwrite a €1.7bn issue of 30-year bonds at a fixed rate of interest. Simultaneously, it entered into a swaps agreement with the banks that enabled it to exchange the fixed rate for a floating rate, in the belief that it would be able to take advantage of falling interest rates over a period of time.

Eurozone interest rates went against the city almost from the start. When it issued the bonds the European Central Bank's variable rate tender interest rate was 2 per cent. It climbed to 4 per cent by the middle of 2007, around the time that Mr Robledo began his investigation, and is now 4.25 per cent.

There are two main charges against the banks and the individuals. The first is that the banks misrepresented to the city the financial benefits of the debt restructuring exercise, of which the bond issue and the swaps agreement were part.

The second is that the banks were not transparent in explaining the terms and conditions of the swaps agreement, and that the city incurred €56m of hidden costs as a result of it, on top of the fees - which by some estimates are around €50m - the city paid for the deal.

Other Italian municipalities are watching the Milan case closely because they, too, are sitting on possible derivatives time bombs.

The Bank of Italy estimates that local authorities may be exposed to about €1bn of losses on these derivatives contracts.

## The relationship between FRAs and swaps

If a corporation buys (or sells) a sequence of LIBOR-based FRAs stretching over, say, two years, in which each of the three-month periods making up that two years is covered by an FRA then we have an arrangement similar to a two-year swap. The company has made a series of commitments to pay or receive differences between the FRA agreed rate and the prevailing spot rate at three-month intervals. For example, Colston plc has a loan for £100 million. This is a floating-rate liability. Interest is set at three-month LIBOR every three months over its two-year life. So, every three months, whatever the rate that London banks are charging for three-month loans to each other is to be charged to Colston.

Thus the company is vulnerable to interest rate rises. The current time is June 20x1 and spot LIBOR rate is set at 5.09 per cent. This is the annualised rate that Colston will pay for the next three months (it will pay one-quarter of this for three-month borrowing). To lock in a rate for the next rollover date, i.e. in September, the company could buy (in June) an FRA set at LIBOR for the three months starting in September and ending in December (a  $3\times6$  forward rate agreement). This FRA is priced at 5.71 per cent. The amount covered can be exactly £100 million because FRA arrangements are flexible to suit the client, being an over-the-counter market. The £100 million is known as the notional amount.

The FRA buyer (Colston) has technically agreed to deliver to the FRA seller 5.71 per cent (see Exhibit 11.20). In return the FRA seller will pay Colston whatever is the spot rate for LIBOR in September. Of course, it would be inefficient to have these two payments made when only one payment (the difference between the two rates) is needed. So, if LIBOR is 5.71 per cent in September no payment is made by either side. However, if LIBOR in September resets at 6.2 per cent Colston will receive a settlement cash flow of 0.49 per cent, or 49 basis points, on £100 million for the three-month period. Thus a payment of £122,500 is received ( $\pounds 100\mathrm{m} \times 0.0049 \times 3/12)$  from the FRA seller.[17]

## Exhibit 11.20 FRA arrangements

If, however, the spot LIBOR in September is 5.5 per cent, Colston will pay a settlement cash flow of 21 basis points:  $\mathbf{\xi}100\mathrm{m}\times 0.0021\times 3 / 12 = \mathbf{\xi}52,500$

FRAs are priced at-the-money, i.e. the current rate in the market for future LIBOR. In the case of Colston in June this is 5.71 per cent for September three-month FRA. The participants in this market consider that the market rate has zero initial value to both parties. However, as rates change the contract gains value for one or other of the contractors.

Colston has locked in the interest rate it will pay for the three months September to December, but what about the other months of the two-year loan commitment? It could enter a series of FRAs for each of the remaining rollover dates. The rates that would be set are shown in Exhibit 11.21.

## Exhibit 11.21 FRA prices for the next two years

<table><tr><td>Time</td><td>Libor rate quoted in June 20x1 for three-month periods starting at various dates over next two years</td></tr><tr><td>June 20x1 (Spot)</td><td>5.09</td></tr><tr><td>Sept. 20x1</td><td>5.71</td></tr><tr><td>Dec. 20x1</td><td>6.05</td></tr><tr><td>Mar. 20x2</td><td>6.42</td></tr><tr><td>June 20x2</td><td>6.70</td></tr><tr><td>Sept. 20x2</td><td>6.98</td></tr><tr><td>Dec. 20x2</td><td>7.06</td></tr><tr><td>Mar. 20x3</td><td>7.18</td></tr></table>

By executing seven FRAs at these rates Colston would pay its lender 5.09 per cent (annualised rate) for the first three months. Thereafter, regardless of how LIBOR moves the effective cost of the loan is 5.71 per cent for the second three months, 6.05 per cent for the third, and so on. Each one of these FRA deals is like a mini swap, with Colston committed to delivering the rate shown in the exhibit and the FRA seller committed to delivering LIBOR to Colston. Or, rather, net payments on the difference between the FRA rate and LIBOR are made. Exhibit 11.22 illustrates for the first four payments.

Using FRAs in this way Colston knows how much it has to pay out over the next two years and so is not vulnerable to unexpected changes in LIBOR. But note that the interest rates are different from one three-month period to another. An alternative open to Colston is to buy a contract with the same rate payable in each of the eight quarters. This rate would be an approximate average of the FRA rates stretching over the two years. This is called a swap. A rough average of the eight LIBOR rates payable in Exhibit 11.21 is 6.39 per cent. The interest rate swap arrangement is

# Exhibit 11.22 shown in Exhibit 11.23. For each three-month period Colston pays the counterparty the swap rate (6.39 per cent) and receives LIBOR. If interest rates rise above 6.39 per cent, Colston would benefit from the swap arrangement because it receives payments from the swap counterparty, which amount to the difference between 6.39 per cent and LIBOR. This enables Colston to accept any increase in LIBOR with equanimity, as the effective cost of the loan is constant at 6.39 per cent (plus 200 bp) regardless of how much is paid to the lender.

## Credit default swap (CDS)

Until the early 1990s once a lender to a company had assumed the risk of loss through default or a similar 'credit event' (failure of the borrower to abide by the agreement) there was little that they could do except wait to see if the borrower paid all the interest and principal on time, as agreed at the outset. In other words, the lender retained all the credit risk and could not pass any of it on to others more willing to bear it. Today, however, we have an enormous market in the selling and buying of protection against default (the total notional amount outstanding on credit default swap contracts exceeds the total amount of debt in the world!).

Under a credit default swap, the seller of protection receives a regular fee (usually every three months over a period of years) from the buyer of protection, and in return promises to make a payoff should the underlying specified reference entity (e.g. BP) default on its obligations with regard to a reference obligation, i.e. a specific bond or loan.

Thus the payment from the buyer of credit protection is a regular amount but the payment the other way, from protection seller to buyer, is a contingent payment depending on whether there is a credit event - see Exhibit 11.24.

## Exhibit 11.24

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/908e86ff80d6f02e5a89c70089bb43df98e3e405dc7a6be6249df96dad07bfe9.jpg)

## Worked example 11.4 Credit default swap

A pension fund manager has bought £20 million (nominal value) of bonds from a software company, Appsoft. He is concerned that at some point over the life of the bonds the company will fail to meet its obligations – there will be a credit event. Even though this is unlikely the manager needs to make absolutely sure that he is protected on the downside. He thus consults one of the organisations that provide CDS prices (e.g. www_markit.com) to gain an idea of the amount he would have to pay for the years of protection. The prices on this website only give a general indication because they report only deals struck by one dealer sometime the previous day. To obtain a more precise cost he will need to contact dealers.

The quote he is given is 160 basis points as the 'spread' expressed as a percentage of the notional principal per year. Thus for £20 million of cover he will pay an annual amount of  $£20\mathrm{m} \times 0.016 = £320,000$ . However, in this market it is normal for this payment to be split up into four quarterly amounts payable on 20 March, 20 June, 20 September and 20 December. Thus the quarterly payments will be approximately £80,000 (technically we should use the actual/360 day count convention described in Chapter 5 to calculate each of the quarterly payments).

The cash flows between the pension fund and the CDS dealer (market maker) are shown on the left half of Exhibit 11.25. The pension fund manager makes quarterly payments and in return the CDS dealer pays an amount contingent on a credit event occurring. In most cases the CDS dealer never pays anything to the pension fund because the reference entity (Appsoft in this case) abides by its bond/loan agreements. Thus CDS arrangements are very similar to standard insurance, and, in fact, many insurance companies have entered this market as protection sellers. The major difference between CDS protection and standard insurance is that with insurance you have to own the asset and suffer the loss to receive a payout.[18] With a CDS you can buy the 'protection' and receive a payout from the dealer regardless of whether you own the asset. So another fund may never own bonds in Appsoft, but can speculate in the CDS market; for example, make regular quarterly payments to the dealer in the hope that Appsoft commits a default and the dealer is forced to make a large payout.

The right side of Exhibit 11.25 shows the payments between the dealer and a hedge fund manager who will take on the credit event risk in return for a quarterly payment. Thus the dealer ends up both buying protection and selling protection. But notice that he has made a margin between the two. Protection is sold for 160 basis points and bought for 155 basis points.

Reference entity: Appsoft

Reference obligation:  $7 \%$  2020 subordinated bonds

Calculation amount: £20 million

## Settlement and credit events

Most CDSs are physically settled which means that when a credit event occurs the protection buyer will deliver debt assets of the reference entity to the protection seller. In return the protection seller pays their par value (£20 million in the case Appsoft). The bonds or loans delivered do not have to be the specified reference obligation, but they cannot be subordinated (higher risk) to it - Appsoft might have issued some other bonds which the pension fund manager chooses to deliver instead of the bond acting as the reference obligation. Once the settlement process is triggered the CDS quarterly premiums paid by the protection buyer cease.

A minority of CDSs are cash settled, that is a credit event triggers a cash payment. To figure out how much is to be paid we first need to find the recovery value on the debt, that is the current market value of the instrument now that it has defaulted. A default does not usually result in the debt becoming completely worthless; a typical recovery rate on a defaulted bond is around 40 per cent of its par value, but this varies tremendously. For some defaulted bonds there may be an active secondary market which will fix the current price, for others it is necessary to conduct an auction process in which dealers submit prices at which they would buy and sell the reference entity's debt obligations. In the case of Lehman Brothers October 2008 auction, the price was set at 8.625 through billions of dollars worth of actual trades, which means that dealers were still willing to pay 8.625 per cent of the par value of Lehman's bonds to hold them even though they were in default. The protection sellers therefore had to make up the remainder of the par value as a cash payment to the CDS holders, i.e. 91.375 per cent of the par value was paid out. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer defaulted in 2009 the bonds were valued at 58.5 per cent of par and so 41.5 per cent was paid out.

So far we have skipped over what we mean by a credit event. The following are the main categories:

- Insolvency of the entity.
- Failure to pay Principal and/or interest not paid.
- Debt restructuring When companies have difficulty paying their debt they negotiate with their lenders to vary the terms of their debt in their favour, e.g. an extension of maturity, interest deferral, principal forgiveness, swapping debt for shares in the firm, resulting in a poorer deal for the lenders. These restructurings are often defined as defaults, but some CDS agreements specifically exclude this type of event due to the lack of clarity on whether a particular restructuring is really a default.
- Obligation acceleration At least one obligation under the debt deal has become payable before its normal maturity date – this may be due to the reference entity defaulting on another debt triggering an early payment.
- Repudiation/moratorium Borrower renounces its debt obligations and refuses to pay, e.g. a government disclaims or disaffirms the validity of a debt claim.

We have focused on the use of CDS when you have an underlying credit exposure to hedge. However, most trades are 'naked CDS', i.e. the protection buyer or seller does not hold a debt in the reference entity. These naked positions have been criticised by politicians for exacerbating the financial crisis – see Exhibit 11.26. The role of CDSs in the 2008 crisis is covered in Chapter 16.

## Exhibit 11.26

# Naked truth about the villain of Europe

# Sophia Grene

Credit default swaps are the scapegoat du jour of politicos looking to blame evil capitalists for recent economic disasters.

They do make a good scapegoat - hard to understand, lacking transparency, seemingly motivated (on the part at least of naked CDS traders) by a desire to profit by others' misfortune.

And talk of large amounts of money - trillions of notional dollars - can be bandied about, which is always impressive.

A credit default swap is an agreement between two parties: one promises a stream of payments to the other, in return for which, the second party will pay out the value of an underlying credit if the credit's original issuer defaults.

This sounds like a fairly straightforward insurance contract - but because it is a swap, it is not technically insurance and therefore there is no requirement for the buyer of the CDS to own the underlying credit or have "insurable interest" in such a credit.

This is what is known as a "naked CDS" and politicians in

Europe are currently suggesting such trades should be banned, claiming they exacerbated Greece's recent financial crisis.

But not all users of CDS are hedge funds or investment banks trying to push on-the-edge companies or countries over the cliff. Some would even question whether those malevolent players exist.

"I don't get the impression that any hedge fund is big enough or bad enough to bully a company or economy into default," says Thomas Ross, who manages credit funds for Henderson Global Investors.

And Luke Spajic, head of pan-European credit and asset backed securities portfolio management at Pimco, adds: "It's not like investors pick on healthy companies or economies."

So why might an asset manager use a naked CDS? A simple example might be a bond fund manager who owns a number of corporate credits in the widget-making sector.

If a major widget-maker were to default, the value of the fund's investments would fall, even if it did not hold any of that company's paper.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/ace49a30-8fe7-4f5f-a9f2-8797893f186a/1021870c2f0f91d19043003d914de08d7c02d5de3261553d5f1bbf7aa53f2d1f.jpg)

Global credit default swaps Amount outstanding (100bn)

In order to hedge against such a risk, it might take out a CDS on the widget maker at risk of defaulting.

Given that the CDS are often more liquid than the bonds they refer to, many asset managers use them, rather than the underlying bonds, to gain exposure to a particular credit or to hedge a risk they do not want in the portfolio.

"We were pretty early adopters of CDS," says Mitesh Shah, deputy head of fixed income at Henderson. "On our central dealing desk, it's now about two-thirds CDS, one third physical."

Working with CDS rather than bonds requires a great deal of attention to processing these contracts, which are still all over-the-counter rather than exchange traded, as well as a focus on risk management, but the efficiencies are worth it, he says.

The fact that CDS are not traded on exchange, or even (yet) through any central clearing houses, makes it hard to get a handle on the value of CDS outstanding. It also means that there is no single source of data.

To complicate matters, brokers writing CDS will usually lay off the risk by taking on an opposite contract elsewhere, so in many cases notional volumes include contrasts that could be offset.

While the total of outstanding notional CDS contracts was  \$31,220bn (20,768bn, €22,846bn) in the middle of 2009, the net was just\$ 393bn of protection bought.

Many commentators are calling for CDS to be traded on exchange, making it easier to see at a glance what is going on in the currently murky market. That is a long way off for the moment.

A more realistic aim is to standardise most contracts and make sure they are traded through central clearing houses.

This would have the advantage not only of greater transparency but also limit the counterparty risk inherent in a swap contract, since the clearing house would bear the risk in case either side of a contract goes bust.

Bringing CDS on exchange or standardising the contracts is a long way short of banning naked CDS, though. While there is general support in the asset management community for the former, which would improve liquidity and trans parency, nobody seems to think banning naked CDS trades would be helpful.

Although it might have some of the intended consequences, by damping rapid increases in spreads (the premium paid for insuring against the default of a credit likely to go bust), this would be offset by problems elsewhere.

"It might move volatility out of the credit affected - but it would probably increase the correlation with other asset classes," says Mr Spajic.

"It might prevent the wide speculative moves we've seen [in CDS spreads], but it would accelerate the pace of dumping cash bonds. It would be just like the old days before CDS"

## Concluding comments

In the hands of the ill-informed and the reckless derivatives can be very dangerous financial instruments. This was proved with a vengeance by the banking sector in 2008 when it became apparent that many people were given power to gain derivative exposure without anyone in the organisation really understanding the nature of the risks they were taking on. They had seen other bankers gain large bonuses and wanted some of the action for themselves, whether or not they understood the potential for things to go wrong. And after all, the mathematicians in the bank said that their models told them that it was very unlikely there would be a serious problem. They had collected data for the prior three years or so and the statistics showed that rarely does the market move so dramatically that a serious loss is incurred. The data said that hardly anyone defaults on sub-prime mortgages, for example. The problem is that mathematicians usually lack the wider and longer-term perspective of someone who has studied financial markets and really understands the nature of the risks when humans are involved.

Hopefully, this chapter has helped you down the road of knowledge, so that you will not repeat the mistakes of others.

## Key points and concepts
- An option is a contract giving one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a financial instrument, commodity or some other underlying asset, at a given price, at or before a specified date.
The writer of a call option is obligated to sell the agreed quantity of the underlying at some time in the future at the insistence of the option purchaser (holder). A writer of a put is obligated to buy.
- American-style options can be exercised at any time up to the expiry date whereas European-style options can only be exercised on a predetermined future date.
- Intrinsic value on an option: the payoff that would be received if the underlying is at its current level when the option expires.
An out-of-the-money option is one that has no intrinsic value.
An in-the-money option has intrinsic value.
- Time value arises because of the potential for the market price of the underlying, over the time to expiry of the option, to change in a way that creates intrinsic value.
- Share options can be used for hedging or speculating on shares.
- Index options whose underlying is a share index are cash settled.
- With a spread betting up-bet on a share the hedger or speculator agrees to a payoff of an amount (say £10) for every one pence rise in the share price of a particular company. If it should decline the hedger or speculator pays the spread betting company the same amount for every pence fall. Similar arrangements are available for commodities, bonds, interest rates, currencies, futures, options, house prices and the outcomes of sporting events. A down-bet gains if values fall.
- With a contract for difference, CFD, the buyer and seller agree to pay, in cash, at the closing of the contract, the difference between the opening and closing price of the underlying shares or other underlying, multiplied by the number of shares (or other underlying) in the contract.
An interest rate cap is a contract that gives the purchaser the right effectively to set a maximum level for interest rates payable. Compensation is paid to the purchaser of a cap if interest rates rise above an agreed level.
- With an interest rate floor, if the interest rate falls below an agreed level, the seller (the floor writer) makes compensatory payments to the floor buyer.
The combination of selling a floor at a low strike rate and buying a cap at a higher strike rate is called a collar.
- A swap is an exchange of cash payment obligations. An interest-rate swap is where one company arranges with a counterparty to exchange interest-rate payments.
Motives for entering into a swap arrangement: (a) to reduce or eliminate exposure to rises in interest rates; (b) to take advantage of market imperfections in the fixed and floating rate bond/loan markets.
Intermediaries (for example, banks) take counterparty positions in swaps and this reduces risk and avoids the necessity for one corporation to search for another with a corresponding swap preference.
A swaption is an option to have a swap at a later date.
In a currency swap the two parties exchange interest obligations (or receipts) and (usually) the principal amount for an agreed period, between two different currencies. On reaching the maturity date of the swap the principal amounts will be re-exchanged at a pre-agreed exchange rate.
- Under a credit default swap, CDS, the seller of protection receives a regular fee from the buyer of protection, and in return promises to make a payoff should the underlying specified reference entity default on its obligations with regard to a reference obligation.
- Most CDSs are physically settled: when a credit event occurs the protection buyer will deliver debt assets of the reference entity to the protection seller in return for the cash payout.
A minority of CDSs are cash settled: the recovery value on the debt is found and the protection seller pays the difference between that and the par value of the reference obligation.

## Appendix 11.1 Option pricing

This appendix describes the factors that influence the market value of a call option on a share. The principles apply to the pricing of other options. The complex mathematics associated with option pricing will be avoided because of their unsuitability for an introductory text. Interested readers are referred to the references and further reading list later in this chapter.

Notation to be used:

C=value of call option

$S =$  current market price of share

$X =$  future exercise price

$r_f =$  risk-free interest rate (per annum)

$t =$  time to expiry (in years)

$s =$  standard deviation of the share price

$\mathrm{e} =$  mathematical fixed constant: 2.718 …

### The factors affecting option value

# 1 Options have a minimum value of zero

$$
\mathrm{C} \geq 0
$$

Even if the share price falls significantly below the exercise price of the option the worst that can happen to the option holder is that the option becomes worth nothing – no further loss is created.

2 The market value of an option will be greater than the intrinsic value at any time prior to expiry. This is because there is a chance that if the option is not exercised immediately it will become more valuable due to the movement of the underlying – it will become (or will move deeper) in-the-money. An option has time value that increases, the longer the time to expiry.

Market value = Intrinsic value + Time value

3 Intrinsic value  $(S - X)$  rises as share price increases or exercise price falls. However this simple relationship needs to be made a little more sophisticated because  $S - X$  is based on the assumption of immediate exercise when the option is about to expire. However if the option is not about to expire there is some value in not having to pay the exercise price until the future exercise date. (Instead of buying the share a call option could be purchased and the remainder invested in a risk-free asset until the exercise date.) So intrinsic value is given a boost by discounting the exercise price by the risk-free rate of return:

$$
\text{In tr in si cv al ue} = S - \frac{X}{\left(1 + r_{f}\right)^{t}}
$$

4 The higher the risk-free rate of return the higher will be intrinsic value, because the money saved by buying an option rather than the underlying security can be invested in a riskless rate of return until the option expires.

5 The maximum value of an option is the price of the share

$$
C \leq S
$$

6 A major influence boosting the time value is the volatility of the underlying share price  $A$  share which has a stable, placid history is less likely to have a significant upward shift in value during the option's lifetime than one which has been highly variable. In option pricing models this factor is measured by the variance  $(\sigma^2)$  or standard deviation  $(\sigma)$  of the share price.

# Black and Scholes' option pricing model

Black and Scholes' option pricing model (BSOPM) was published in 1973 and is still widely employed today despite the more recent modifications to the original model and the development of different option-pricing models. The BSOPM is as follows:

$$
C = S N (d_{1}) - X e^{- \mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{f}} t} N (d_{2})
$$ where:


$N(.) =$ cumulative normal distribution function of $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$

$$ d_{1} = \frac{\ln (S / X) + \left(r_{f} + \sigma^{2} / 2\right) t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}}
$$

$\ln =$ natural log

$$ d_{2} = d_{1} - \sigma \sqrt{t}
$$
