# Foreign exchange markets

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

The currency markets have an enormous impact on businesses and on individuals. These are often indirect effects, e.g. redundancies arising through loss of international competitiveness. This chapter sheds light on the nature of the FX markets and on the impact of FX shifts and discusses ways of reducing the risk. By the end of it the reader should be able to: explain the role and importance of the foreign exchange markets;

■ outline the operation of the FX markets;

- contrast various fixed exchange rate regimes with floating or managed floating; describe hedging techniques to reduce the risk associated with transactions entered into in another currency;
■ consider methods of dealing with the risk that assets, income and liabilities denominated in another currency, when translated into home-currency terms, are distorted; describe techniques for reducing the impact of foreign exchange changes on the competitive position of the firm;
■ outline the theories that attempt to explain the reasons for currency rate changes.

Foreign exchange (forex or FX) markets developed thousands of years ago in response to the growth of international trade. To begin with, universal stores of value (such as gold or a set weight (e.g. shekel of barley) were used, and a trader would receive from his customer an amount in gold or barley equivalent to the value of the goods in his own country. The UK currency, the pound sterling, was originally a pound weight of sterling silver, giving traders the ability to price their goods in a foreign country in terms of the weight of silver. As currency usage increased, traders from one country selling their wares in another country had to develop a less cumbersome method of working out how much they should receive for their goods and so direct exchanges of currency became more prevalent.

Today most of that trading is carried out by the FX departments of major banks. The amount traded on the foreign exchange markets is a colossal amount around  \$4,000 billion per day. Actual import and export trading forms a tiny percentage of this figure. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development world exports are more than\$ 16,000 billion per year, equating to a mere 44 billion per day, about 1 per cent of the amount traded on the FX markets. The vast amount remaining is made up of currency trading, by banks, governments, institutions, companies and individuals.

This chapter looks at the foreign exchange markets from a number of angles. First, there is a description of the different types of FX markets, from simple spot 'immediate' delivery of one currency for another (immediate means within two days), to forwards which allow exchange of currency at a future date. Then we examine the way in which FX prices are quoted, with a particular emphasis on understanding the tables in the Financial Times. It has not always been the case that the main currencies have been allowed to float against each other determined by market forces. In the past rates of exchange were usually set by government in a variety of interventionist regimes. We look at some of these alternatives to floating. Another important angle is the impact of shifts in FX rates on people and businesses. Significant sums can be lost and firms can go out of business if they fail to manage the risk. We discuss some of the techniques used, which helps to illustrate a number of the instruments available in the FX markets. Finally, we ask how the level of exchange rate is determined: What are the major influences?

# The foreign exchange markets

On the most basic level, foreign exchange markets are (hugely liquid) markets in which one currency is exchanged for another, at a rate usually determined by market supply and demand. For example, if there is a lot of demand from the UK for US dollars, then the buying actions of market players will lead to pressure for the price of each US dollar to rise and conversely the price of each UK pound will fall (less demand and greater supply).

FX trading takes place around the globe 24 hours a day. It is largely OTC trading where the trades are carried out between two parties directly without going through a regulated exchange. The huge amounts of trading makes a significant impact on international flows of capital. Of the global total of 3.98 trillion estimated in 2010 (see Exhibit 12.1), over one-third is through London.

We can see from the Exhibit 12.1 that there are many different FX markets. In other words, there are many different types of foreign exchange deals available:

- Spot transaction A single outright transaction involving the exchange of two currencies at a rate agreed on the date of the contract for value or delivery (cash settlement) within two business days.1
- **Forward A transaction involving the exchange of two currencies at a rate agreed on the date of the contract for value or delivery (cash settlement) at some time in the future (more than two business days later). These contracts are negotiated and agreed between the two parties without going through a regulated exchange. Later in the chapter we look at the use of forward markets by corporations to fix the exchange rate for a transaction they will undertake months, or even years, from now. This brings a high degree of certainty about the rate of exchange at which they will be able to transact.

- Foreign exchange swap (FX swap) A single deal with two parts to it. First, there is the actual exchange of two currencies on a specific date at a rate agreed at the time of the conclusion of the contract – this is usually a spot exchange but it can be a forward. Second, there is a reverse exchange of the same two currencies at a date further in the future at a rate agreed at the time of the contract. The rates of exchange are usually different in the two parts. These FX swaps take place all the time between professional players based in banks as they try to balance out their currency positions and reduce their risk exposure. They usually cover a period of no more than one week. As Exhibit 12.1 shows, these arrangements make up the largest element in the FX markets, but they are of little significance to non-bank players.
- Currency swap A contract which commits two counterparties to exchange streams of interest payments in different currencies for an agreed period of time and usually to exchange principal amounts in different currencies at a pre-agreed exchange rate at maturity. These are the swaps discussed in Chapter 11 being linked to long-term loans with interest payments to be made – they should not be confused with FX swaps. A currency swaption is an option to enter into a currency swap contract.
- Currency option An option contract that gives the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a currency at a specified exchange rate during a specified period.
- Future Foreign currency futures are exchange-traded transactions to completion exchange of currency at a future date, with standard contract sizes and maturity dates – for example, £62,500 for next November at an agreed rate.

Although over one-third of all FX trading takes place in London (see Exhibit 12.2), with London carrying out twice as much trade as its nearest rival, the US, the actual currency that dominates is the US dollar, which acts as a counterparty in over 85 per cent of all trading on one side of the trade – see Exhibit 12.3. The currencies most commonly traded are USD, the US dollar (), EUR, the euro (), JPY, the Japanese yen (), GBP, the UK pound (), AUD, the Australian dollar (), CAD, the Canadian dollar ( and CHF, the Swiss franc (Fr).

The US dollar has become the currency that is accepted and used worldwide. This is partly due to the legacy left from the Bretton Woods agreement (see later in the chapter for details on this), but mostly to do with the size, strength and stability of the US economy.

# FX mistakes

There are many cases of calamitous FX trading, where one counterparty in the trading has made major losses either through inexperience, arrogance or simple error.

The German state-owned bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) carried out FX trading like most other banks and many of its transactions were set to take place automatically. During the weekend of 13/14 September 2008 the world became aware that Lehman Brothers, the US-based investment bank, was in severe financial difficulty and on the brink of bankruptcy. On the morning of 15 September an automatic payment of €319 million was sent from KfW to Lehman. This was the KfW side of a €/USD currency swap. What happened next is history: Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the return part of the trade never materialised, leaving KfW with a loss of €319 million. No one at KfW had thought to check the automatic payments system for any relating to Lehman.

In 2002, US currency trader John Rusnak racked up losses of 691 million for his employer, Baltimore-based Allfirst Bank, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks (AIB), seemingly not out of dishonesty but trying to cover up bad trades. Rusnak made losses in 1997 on Japanese yen forwards and spent the next few years using ever more ingenious methods to hide his accumulating losses, until February 2002 when suspicions arose and investigations began.

The Hong Kong-based steel and mining conglomerate Citic Pacific was hit by losses of US \$1.9 billion in October 2008. Citic has an iron ore mining project in Western Australia. For this operation it needs Australian dollars. To minimise currency exposure the company took out hedges in the A$  against the US$; unfortunately there was a decline in the A$ against the US$. Citic had not put any stop losses into its contracts to automatically close the position on an adverse movement below a certain level, and so made the US\$1.9 billion loss.

# FX trading

In contrast to equity trading, where most countries tend to have one (or, at most, a handful of) major trading exchanges and trading is tightly regulated, trading on the foreign exchange market does not have a focal position where all trading is supervised and data is collected and displayed. The trading is carried out in numerous locations, wherever a trader is and can access a computer screen or a mobile phone screen. Many trading platforms now offer an app for the new generation of mobile phones and tablet computers giving traders full access to all their facilities and data, enabling them to download data and carry out trading wherever they are. Individual investors can also take advantage of this new technology, giving them access to data that was once available only to professional traders.

Some of the trades are on regulated exchanges but most are not. Anyone with the requisite knowledge can take part in FX trading, and regulation is lax for the most part. Having said that, the vast majority of trading is done by major international banks and their subsidiaries, with reputations to lose so there is a high degree of self-regulation.

Trading is constant, taking place on a 24-hour basis, with the high concentration of activity moving with the sun from one major financial centre to another. Most trading occurs when both the European and New York markets are open – this is when it is afternoon in Frankfurt, Zurich and London and morning on the east coast of the Americas. Later the bulk of the trade passes to San Francisco and Los Angeles, followed by Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. There are at least 40 other trading centres around the world in addition to these main ones.

Most banks carry out proprietary trading, i.e. they trade in the hope of making profits on behalf of the bank itself. The banks are in the process of concentrating their dealers in three or four regional hubs. These typically include London as well as New York and a site in Asia, where Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore are keen to establish their dominance. According to a survey by the magazine Euromoney, FX trading carried out by banks is highly concentrated, with over 77 per cent carried out by only ten banks (see Exhibit 12.4), with Deutsche Bank having held top spot for the past six years to 2009.

When a non-bank organisation needs an FX deal it mostly trades with a bank, but there are exchanges for some types of dealing. The main difference between FX trading via banks and

FX trading carried out on exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is that exchange trading tends to deal in standard amounts and maturities. The amounts and maturities of these contracts are fixed and inflexible, so they may be less suitable for company use, where the company might need to hedge specific amounts for a specific time, and would therefore be better served using the flexibility offered by a bank. Dealing through an exchange facilitates clearing and settlement and exchange-traded currency instruments are liquid and tradable.

The buyers and sellers of foreign currencies are:

- commercial companies with export or import interests; international banks and commercial banks carrying our proprietary trading;
- dealers trading and acting as market makers in currency (usually the big banks);
- brokers buying and selling currencies on behalf of a client, e.g. a client bank or commercial firm; governments needing foreign currency for overseas trade or to pay for activities abroad;
- speculators or arbitrageurs taking advantage of perceived FX pricing anomalies;
- tourists or investors (e.g. in property or shares) needing to pay in foreign currency;
- fund managers investing abroad (pensions, insurance companies, etc.);
- central banks (smoothing out fluctuations or managing the rate to a desired level).

There are various ways in which deals are done. First, there is the traditional approach of the two dealers talking on the telephone and agreeing to trade. One of the dealers here may be a non-bank customer such as a manufacturing firm. If the customer approaches the bank without going through an intermediary these are 'customer direct trades'. However, a broker will frequently act on behalf of a customer to deal with banks in the FX markets – if conducted over the telephone these are 'voice broker' trades. The trades between banks, referred to as 'inter-dealer direct trades', can be either via direct telephone communication or direct electronic dealing systems – these electronic deals are shown separately as the largest segment in Exhibit 12.5. Increasingly deals are conducted over electronic dealing systems. Banks are the main users of these systems, but there are special systems set up for customers. Some of these are run by a single bank as a 'proprietary platform'. Others are managed by a group of banks – multibank dealing systems. Examples of multibank systems include FXAll, Currenex, FXConnect, Globalink and eSpeed.

The electronic platforms have allowed smaller banks to access the best prices and provide them with the opportunity to deal alongside the large banks on an even basis because of the transparency

Exhibit 12.5 Foreign exchange market turnover by execution method, 2010 of the systems. Rapid price dissemination from electronic systems has, to a great extent, 'levelled the playing field', whereas in the old days only the large banks could 'see' the market prices through their telephone contacts.

# Exchange rates

We now look more closely at exchange rates. We start with some terms used in FX markets. First, we provide a definition of an exchange rate:

An exchange rate is the price of one currency (the base currency) expressed in terms of another (the secondary, counter or quote currency).

Therefore if the exchange rate between the US dollar and the pound is  \mathrm{US\ 1.60 = £1.00}  this means that  £1.00  will cost  \mathrm{US\ 1.60} . Taking the reciprocal,  \mathrm{US\ 1.00}  will cost 62.50 pence. The standardised forms of expression are:

US$/£:1.60 or

US1.60/£ or

USD1.60/£

Exchange rates are expressed in terms of the number of units of the first currency per single unit of the second currency. Most currencies are quoted to four decimal places and the smallest variation used in trading is a pip which is one ten-thousandth of one unit of currency (e.g. \$1), or 0.0001. So for the US$/£ exchange rate on 16 November 2010 the rate was quoted in the Financial Times as:

US1.5988/£

However, this is still not accurate enough because currency exchange rates are not generally expressed in terms of a single 'middle rate' as above, but are given as a rate at which you can buy the first currency (bid rate) and a rate at which you can sell the first currency (offer rate). This is called the spread and it enables market makers (traders) to make a profit on buying and selling currencies. In the case of the US$/£ exchange rate the market rates on 16 November 2010 were:

US1.5988/£ 'middle rate'

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/d83a3d113aee6d08115e968a4b444390f39e95153e3bbbcc77a592da0c4dd3d8.jpg)

So if you wished to purchase US1 million the cost would be:

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 5 9 8 6} = £ 6 2 5, 5 4 7
$$

However, if you wished to sell US1 million you would receive:

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 5 9 9 0} = £ 6 2 5, 3 9 1
$$

The foreign exchange dealers are transacting with numerous buyers and sellers every day and they make a profit on the difference between the bid price and offer price (the bid/offer spread). In the above example if a dealer sold US \$1 million and bought US\$ 1 million with a bid/offer spread of 0.04 of a cent, a profit of £625,547 - £625,391 = £156 is made.

# Worked example 12.1 Forex

The basic elements of forex are so important for the rest of the chapter that it is worthwhile to pause and consolidate understanding of the quoted rates through some exercises.

Answer the following questions on the basis that the euro/US$ (EUR/USD) exchange rate is 1.3605-1.3609, that is, US\$1.3605/€ or US1.3609/€ depending on whether you are buying or selling euros.

1 What is the cost of buying €200,000?

2 How much would it cost to purchase US4m?

3 How many dollars would be received from selling €800,000?

 4 How many euros would be received from selling US240,000?

# Answers

1 €200,000 × 1.3609 = 272,180

2 4,000,000

1.3605 = €2,940,096

3 €800,000 × 1.3605 = 1,088,400

4 240,000

1.3609 = €176,354

# Sources of information

Information on currency exchange rates is easily available in newspapers such as the Financial Times, or on websites such as Reuters, Yahoo Finance or any of the other numerous financial websites. Rates may vary very slightly between them all.

Tuesday to Saturday the Financial Times reports the previous day's trading in over 50 of the most commonly traded currencies in the FX market, giving their value relative to the dollar, euro and pound. The figures shown in Exhibit 12.6 relate to dealings on 12 November 2010. Of course, by the time a newspaper reader receives the information in this table the rates may well have changed as the 24-hour markets execute their trades continuously. However, www.ft.com and other websites provide much more up-to-the-minute and detailed information.

The prices shown under the pound columns in Exhibit 12.6 are the middle price of the foreign currency in terms of £1 in London at 4pm the previous afternoon. So, for instance, the mid-price of £1 for immediate delivery is 1.6338 Australian dollars. For the US dollar columns the prices for the pound and euro are the number of dollars per currency unit, either per pound or per euro. However, for other currencies the rate shown is the number of units of the other currency per US1 – for example, 1.0098 Canadian dollars per US dollar. For the euro columns the rate shown is the number of units of the other currency per euro – for example the spot mid-rate against the pound is 84.84 pence per euro.

On Mondays the  $FT$  publishes a much more comprehensive list of exchange rates for over 200 countries, again with their relative values against the dollar, euro and pound.

While the most common currencies often have forward rates quoted, there are many currencies for which forward quotes are difficult to obtain. The so-called exotic currencies generally do not have forward rates quoted by dealers. These are currencies for which there is little trading demand to support international business, etc. On the other hand, spot markets exist for most of the world's currencies.

The first forward price (middle price) is given as the 'One month' rate. Looking at the sterling and US$ rates you could commit yourself to the sale of a quantity of dollars for delivery in one month at a rate that is fixed at about US\$1.6148 per pound. In this case you will need fewer US dollars to buy £1 in one month's time compared with the spot rate of exchange, therefore the dollar is at a premium on the one-month forward rate.

The forward rate for one month shows a different relationship with the spot rate for the euro against the pound. Here more euros are required (€1.1788) to purchase a pound in one month's time compared with an 'immediate' spot purchase (€1.1787), therefore the euro on one-month forward delivery is at a discount to the pound. We look at the relationships between spot and forward rates later in the chapter (interest rate parity theory).

The Financial Times table lists quotations up to one year for the four strongest currencies, the dollar, euro, yen and pound, but, as this is an over-the-counter market, it is possible to go as far forward in time as required - provided a counterparty can be found. Use of forward exchange rates is widespread. For example, airline companies expecting to purchase planes many years hence may use the distant forward market to purchase the foreign currency they need to pay the manufacturer so that they know with certainty the quantity of their home currency they are required to find when the planes are delivered.

The table in Exhibit 12.6 displays standard periods of time for forward rates, one month, three months and one year. These are instantly available and are frequently traded. However, forward rates are not confined to these particular days in the future. It is possible to obtain rates for any day in the future, say, 74 or 36 days hence for any amount of currency, but these would require a specific quotation from a bank.

The Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shown at the bottom of the table are artificial currencies made up from baskets of fixed amounts of four currencies, the pound sterling, the US dollar, the yen and the euro.

# Worked example 12.2 Covering in the forward market

Suppose that on 12 November 2010 a UK exporter sells goods to a customer in France invoiced at €5,000,000. Payment is due three months later. With the spot rate of exchange at €1.1787/£ (see Exhibit 12.6) the exporter, in deciding to sell the goods, has in mind a sales price of:

$$
\frac {\text {€} 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 1 7 8 7} = £ 4, 2 4 1, 9 6 1
$$

The UK firm bases its decision on the profitability of the deal on this amount expressed in pounds.

However, the rate of exchange may vary between November and February: the size and direction of the move is uncertain. If the pound strengthens against the euro and the rate is then €1.40/£, the UK exporter will make a currency loss by waiting three months and exchanging the euro received into sterling at spot rates in February. The exporter will receive only £3,571,429

$$
\frac {\text {€} 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 4 0} = £ 3, 5 7 1, 4 2 9 \quad \text {c a u s i n g a l o s s o f} \quad \frac {\text {£} 4 , 2 4 1 , 9 6 1}{\text {£} 6 7 0 , 5 3 2}
$$

If sterling weakens to €1.10/£ a currency gain is made. The pounds received in February if euro are exchanged at this spot rate will be:

$$
\frac {\text {€} 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 1 0} = £ 4, 5 4 5, 4 5 5 \quad \text {a n d t h e c u r r e n c y g a i n w i l l b e} \quad \frac {\text {£} 4 , 5 4 5 , 4 5 5}{£ 3 0 3 , 4 9 4}
$$

Rather than run the risk of a possible loss on the currency side of the deal the exporter may decide to cover in the forward market. Under this arrangement the exporter promises to sell €5m against the pound in three months (the agreement is made on 12 November for delivery of currency in February). The forward rate available (ignoring any market makers' spreads and transaction costs) on 12 November is €1.1791/£. This forward contract means that the exporter will receive £4,240,522 in February

$$
\frac {\text {€} 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 1 7 9 1} = £ 4, 2 4 0, 5 2 2
$$ regardless of the way in which the spot exchange rate moves over the three months.


In February the transactions in Exhibit 12.7 take place.

# Exhibit 12.7 Example of the forward market

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/57572792ffbc7ef2fc4914e0140f0a5fc90735e6effb0195c95a61cced2da60b.jpg)

From the outset (in November) the exporter knew the amount to be received in February (assuming away counterparty risk). It might, with hindsight, have been better not to use the forward market but to exchange the euro in February at a spot rate of say €1.1000/£. This would have resulted in a larger income for the firm. But in November when the export took place there was uncertainty about what the spot rate would be in February. If the exporter had waited to exchange the currency until February and the spot rate in February had turned out to be €1.4000/£ the exporter would have made less.

Covering in the forward market is a form of insurance which leads to greater certainty – and certainty has a value. For many companies it is vital that they have this certainty about income and expenditure; they cannot afford to leave things and hope they will turn out satisfactorily.

# Settlement

The vast sums of money traded every working day across the world mean that banks are exposed to the risk that they may irrevocably pay over currency to a counterparty before they receive another currency in return because settlement systems are operating in different time zones. A bank could fail after receiving one leg of its foreign exchange trades but before paying the other leg – this is called Herstatt risk after Bankhaus Herstatt, a German bank, which failed in 1974 with 620 million of unsettled trades (where one side of the trade has paid but the other side has not). In this case the crisis was due to the time difference between Europe and the US; Bankhaus Herstatt received its dollar payments in Frankfurt, but ceased trading before the reciprocal payment could be made in New York. Its failure caused panic and gridlock in the FX markets, which took weeks to unravel.

Following this disaster, the major banks formed a new means of settlement, Continuous Linked Settlement, which began operating in 2002. The new entity, CLS Bank, is owned by banking members who trade in the FX markets. The whole point of CLS is PvP (payment versus payment), simultaneous settlement of both legs of trading, thereby eliminating Herstatt risk, but also incurring charges (the charges are small in relation to the sums involved, £0.07 for every £1 million of trading value). CLS claim to match payments within 38 minutes, and if a trade is not matched, it is returned to its originator, so there is no possibility of one party to the trade suffering loss due to the other party's failure to settle. Even though matching takes place in minutes spot transactions will be settled (currency actually transferred) two days later.

Settlement is offered in seventeen currencies and nearly 10,000 banks, financial institutions and investment funds use the service, with up to 1 million trades settled daily.

Over 50 per cent of global FX trading uses multi-lateral netting, where the nett value only of trades is settled. For example if a bank sold  \$1 billion, but also bought\$ 900 million, the settlement is for only 100 million. This reduces the forex risk element.

CME in Chicago offers guaranteed clearing and settlement through its own clearing service CME ClearPort, and claims never to have had any defaults in 100 years of trading.

# Cross exchange rates

The major currencies of the world, US dollar, euro, pound and Swiss franc are easily exchangeable directly into other currencies. Some currency pairs are traded much less frequently and so the market is thin and illiquid, which usually means costly. For example, the Philippines peso and the United Arab Emirates dirham would see little trade and so a company exporting from the Philippines to UAE receiving dirhams would have difficulty obtaining quotation for a good rate of exchange. The traditional way of dealing with this was to exchange the dirhams into one of the major currencies, usually the US dollar, and then to exchange the dollars for pesos. Thus most currency rates are quoted in terms of the US dollar primarily, rather than against the 170 other currencies in the world – it simply becomes too cumbersome to quote all the possible two-currency rates and so the rate against the US dollar is set as the benchmark. Of course, today a single bank will be able to offer a service of quoting both the dirham:dollar and the peso:dollar rates, in which case it is not necessary to bother with the exchange to and from dollars, but merely to quote the rates and, if the client likes them, for the bank to transact dirhams for pesos.

A cross-rate is the exchange rate of two currencies that are normally expressed in terms of a third currency, usually the US dollar.

Thus the Philippines peso and the UAE dirham are both cross currencies because they are normally quoted against the dollar. Tables of cross-rates are produced which show the exchange rate between these lesser used currencies. At first glance you see what appears to be a direct rate of exchange, say dirhams for pesos, but for most of these the rates are derived from prices against the US dollar. For example, if the exchange rates are four dirhams for one US dollar, and 60 pesos to one dollar then the cross-rate of dirhams to pesos is as shown in Exhibit 12.8. Four dirhams equal 60 pesos, therefore one dirham can be exchanged for 15 pesos.

# Exchange rate regimes

# Fixed FX regimes

Fixed exchange rate regimes require the participating countries to keep their currencies held at a constant rate or within a certain percentage of an agreed rate. Any deviation from the agreed percentage must be managed and brought back into line by the domestic central bank buying or selling its own currency. If there are significant changes to domestic economic circumstances, then a currency may be devalued or revalued, with the agreement of the participating countries.

# Gold standard

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, trading countries adopted the gold standard, where their currency was fixed at a set price in gold. This encouraged stability in currencies relative to other currencies. It also prevented inflation, as economies could only grow their money supply in correlation to their supply of gold; it discouraged governments from overspending by issuing more banknotes than their reserves of gold warranted.

The gold standard enabled traders dealing overseas to exchange the income received in foreign currency for a set amount of gold and the amount of gold had a set value in their home currency, thus exchange rates were effectively fixed. People were entitled to exchange banknotes for actual gold, and banks issued banknotes based on the amount of gold held in their vaults.

The turmoil faced by the world as a result of the First World War and then the economic crises of the 1920s and 1930s caused the gold standard to be discontinued. Governments needed to issue banknotes in excess of their gold reserves to stabilise their economies, having in many cases used much of their gold to finance warfare. A central bank's promise on its banknotes came to be based more on the country's credibility and economic standing rather than its actual physical holding of gold.

Various attempts were made to revive the gold standard, but it became increasingly difficult for any government to hold sufficient gold to guarantee all its banknotes in issue, while also altering money supply to make economic adjustments for its future stability and prosperity. A major drawback for reviving the gold standard is the limited supply of gold in the world and the physical impossibility of countries possessing gold reserves to cover their issue of currency, stifling any possibility of expansion. To give an idea of the numbers involved: the World Bank estimates that all countries' gold reserves in 2010 were about 30 tonnes, valued at a little over £600 billion. In the UK alone, public spending in 2010 was a similar amount.

# Bretton Woods

After the economic chaos following the First World War the UK and US determined to try to prevent similar problems after the Second World War. To promote post-war economic and financial stability, delegates from all 44 allied countries gathered at the Bretton Woods conference (named after the New Hampshire town where it took place) in 1944. The negotiations resulted in an exchange rate system whereby the currencies were fixed to the US dollar, which in turn was fixed to the price of gold at 35 per ounce of gold. At this time, the US was the major industrial nation in the world, and also held the most reserves of gold. This agreement kept the US at the forefront of the modern world and promoted the ever-present hegemony of the US dollar as the major currency of the world.


The participating countries had to keep within a band of 1 per cent of the fixed value and central banks would buy or sell the dollar against their own currency to keep within the limits. Leading the UK delegation was John Maynard Keynes, the world-renowned economist, who was instrumental in the planning of the other major achievements to come out of the conference, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund through which exchange rate stability was ensured.

The Bretton Woods agreement lasted for nearly 30 years until the 1970s when inflation, the cost of the Vietnam war and US welfare reforms forced the US to cancel the dollar's convertibility to gold. The US had started to export higher inflation to the rest of the world and there was an excess supply of US dollars in the world, more and more of which other countries tried to convert into gold at the agreed rate. Faced with drained gold reserves, in 1971 the US president Richard Nixon suspended the Bretton Woods agreement and allowed the US dollar to float against other currencies.

Since then, most currencies have floated against other currencies, with central banks intervening when necessary to buy and sell their own currency to keep its value

# European Exchange Rate Mechanism

Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement, some European countries made various attempts to establish fixed rates between their currencies to encourage trade.

The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 aimed to stabilise economic conditions and promote integration between European countries. It created the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which eventually led to the adoption of the euro in 1999 as the universal currency for most EU members. In the lead up to the EMU, the currencies of participating countries were subject to the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which kept each currency between strict limits.

Fixing exchange rates between European countries or adopting the euro had mixed blessings. While the stability of the currency helps in forward planning, the UK and Italy were forced out of the ERM in 1992 because the changing economic circumstances in their countries meant that the pound and the lira were set at an excessively high rate of exchange, stifling economic recovery.[2] In more recent years a common interest rate in the Eurozone countries has meant an awkwardly low interest rate environment for Ireland, Greece and Spain, which resulted in unsustainable property booms and wage rises followed by busts.

# Pegs and bands

There are quite a few countries which keep their currency pegged to the US dollar. They include the Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the US dollar since 1998, and a number of emerging nations. While the HK$ is fixed to the US dollar it moves in line with that currency as it fluctuates against other currencies, so it is not fixed against other currencies. It is thought that the dollar is stable (relative to some developing countries, anyway), and so keeping pegged to the dollar helps to maintain a currency's own stability. It also helps to prevent the home currency rising against the dollar which may make exporting more difficult.

# Floating FX regimes

Most major countries now adopt a floating FX regime, where the exchange rate for their currency is governed by supply and demand. This allows countries to keep control of their monetary policy, and it has been noted that floating rates are predisposed towards equilibrium, that is the supply and demand even each other out.

Some floating regimes do not have official limits for the movements of their currencies but nevertheless governments sometimes intervene to prevent their currency moving too far in a certain direction. These are known as managed floats or dirty floats. The low rate of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar has caused great frustration in many countries, despite it being managed to gradually appreciate (very slowly). Exporters from other countries argue that the Chinese government is keeping the yuan artificially low to boost its exporters.


# FX volatility and its effects

You might wonder what is the significance of fluctuating FX rates. If you go on holiday to Europe, you might get more or less euro for your pound or dollar than last year – usually a fairly minor boost or inconvenience. But for companies trading millions, billions or trillions internationally, even small differences in exchange rates can have major consequences.

If a UK firm holds dollars or assets denominated in dollars and the value of the dollar rises against the pound, then the dollars and dollar assets are worth more in pounds and an FX profit is made. Conversely, should the pound rise relative to the dollar, dollars and dollar assets are worth less compared to the pound and an FX loss will be incurred. These potential gains or losses can be very large.

For example, as shown on Exhibit 12.9, between December 2007 and February 2009 the dollar appreciated by just over a third against the pound, so anyone who sold pounds for dollars in December 2007 and kept them would have made a 33 per cent profit on changing them back into pounds. If the money had also been put to work earning interest more could have been realised.

Shifts in the value of foreign exchange can impact on various aspects of trading activities. Fluctuating FX rates may wipe out profits from a project, an export deal or a portfolio investment (for example a pension fund buying foreign shares). One of the problems caused by exchange rate fluctuations can be illustrated by worked example 12.3.

# Worked example 12.3

On 24 July 2008 two UK companies, GBX and GBA, agreed to purchase  \$10,000 of goods from US company USY. GBX paid the\$ 10,000 in July 2008 but GBA paid in January 2009, expecting to exchange pounds for dollars then.

At the time of purchase, the goods would have cost £5,012 if the pounds were exchanged at the prevailing spot rate. However, due to GBP/USD rates changing, when 24 January came, company GBA had to pay £7,283 to obtain 10,000, so GBA made a substantial FX loss compared with if it had obtained the dollars in July 2008 – see Exhibit 12.10.

Verdict, a retail research group, forecasts clothing inflation of 4.4 per cent this year, the highest level since 1986.

The forecast will be bad news for consumers, who have become used to ever cheaper garments and are set to see their incomes squeezed by austerity measures. It will also heighten fears over inflation, which remains stubbornly high.

"Despite the additional pressures on the consumer, prices can't defy gravity forever and, ultimately, over the next few years the only way will be up," says Neil Saunders, consulting director at Verdict.

British consumers have enjoyed a decade of deflation as value retailers such as Primark and supermarkets have whittled away prices, while China's emergence as a manufacturing base brought the cheap clothing that has reshaped the high street. But this era is coming to an end, as the weakness of sterling makes garments purchased with dollars from suppliers in Asia more expensive.


Last year, British retailers were able to offset higher costs from currency weakness by striking competitive deals with Chinese suppliers keen to keep factories running amid a dearth of US orders. Lower commodity prices also fed through to better terms from suppliers.

But Chinese factories are now winning more orders, while the country's wage costs are rising as Chinese workers strive for better terms and conditions. Suppliers' leeway to offer deals has been clipped by their own costs rising. Cotton has gained about 50 percent in the past year, and is trading close to its highest level in 14 years.


Shipping costs have also escalated, while British retailers are experiencing a "double whammy" according to Luca Solca, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, from the weakness of sterling - reflecting Britain's overstretched balance sheet - and a rising renminbi.

Apart from the problems fluctuating exchange rates cause for importers there are at least four other major issues:
- Income to be received from abroad For example, if a UK firm has exported goods to Canada on six months' credit terms, payable in Canadian dollars (C$), it is uncertain how many pounds it will actually receive because the Canadian currency could change in value compared to the pound in the intervening period.
- The valuation of foreign assets and liabilities In today's globalised marketplace many firms own assets abroad, or have foreign subsidiaries. The value of any of these assets or liabilities in domestic currency terms can change simply because of FX movements. See below for an excerpt from the BP Annual Report and Accounts 2009, showing just what a complex task it is to value overseas subsidiaries and their operations. It is clear that these figures could deviate from what is expected due to currency fluctuations.

# Burberry targets Chinese tourists

FT

# By Andrea Felsted

Burberry is targeting the spending power of Chinese consumers in the world's big luxury markets, as more Chinese travel overseas.

While Burberry is expanding in China - particularly focusing on the affluent male consumer - Angela Ahrendts, chief executive, said the Chinese tourist was another important source of business.

Over 30 per cent of our business in the UK today is to a Chinese consumer. They are free to travel there now and as a company we think not just [about] the Chinese market but how we cater to the Chinese consumer, with multiple dialects, in the top 10 flagship markets in the world," she said.


"They have read about them, dreamed about them, and now they are going to London, Paris, New York and Los Angeles."

Stacey Cartwright, chief financial officer, said that when it came to the UK, sales to Chinese consumers were being boosted by the weakness of sterling which increased their spending power. She estimated that Burberry goods were 40 per cent cheaper in the UK than China, primarily because of taxes and duties.

How, then, do companies deal with all this volatility? There are various ways of vitiating the risk of currency fluctuations.

# Dealing with exchange rate risk

For firms which operate in international trade, there are three forms of exposure to risk, transaction risk, translation risk and economic risk.

# Transaction risk

Transaction risk is the risk that transactions already entered into, or for which the firm is likely to have a commitment in a foreign currency, will have a variable value in the home currency because of exchange-rate movements.

This type of risk is primarily associated with imports or exports. If a company imports or exports goods on credit the amount it will pay out or receive in home-currency terms is subject to uncertainty.

Transaction risk also arises when firms invest abroad, say, opening a new office or manufacturing plant. If the costs of construction are paid for over a period the firm may be exchanging the home currency for the foreign currency to make the payments. The amounts of the home currency required are uncertain if the exchange rate is subject to rate shifts. Also the cash inflows back to the parent are subject to exchange rate risk.

In addition, when companies borrow in a foreign currency, committing themselves to regular interest and principal payments in that currency, they are exposed to FX risk.

# Translation risk

Translation risk arises because financial data denominated in one currency are then expressed in terms of another currency. Between two accounting dates the figures can be affected by exchange-rate movements, greatly distorting comparability. The financial statements of overseas business units are usually translated into the home currency in order that they might be consolidated with the group's financial statements. Income, expenses, assets and liabilities have to be re-expressed in terms of the home currency. Note that this is purely a paper-based exercise; it is translation and not the conversion of real money from one currency to another. If exchange rates were stable, comparing subsidiary performance and asset position would be straightforward. However, if exchange rates move significantly the results can be severely distorted.

There are two elements to translation risk:

1 The balance sheet effect Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency can fluctuate in value in home-currency terms with FX-market changes. For example, if a UK company acquires A\$1 million of assets in Australia when the rate of exchange is A\$1.6/£ this can go into the UK group's accounts at a value of £625,000. If, over the course of the next year, the Australian dollar falls against sterling to A\$1.8/£, when the consolidated accounts are drawn up and the asset is translated at the current exchange rate at the end of the year it is valued at only £555,556, a 'paper loss' of £69,444. And yet the asset has not changed in value in A$ terms one jot. These 'losses' are normally dealt with through balance sheet reserves.
2 The profit and loss account effect Currency changes can have an adverse impact on the group's profits because of the translation of foreign subsidiaries' profits. This often occurs even though the subsidiaries' managers are performing well and increasing profit in terms of the currency in which they operate.

# Economic risk

A company's economic value may decline as a result of FX movements causing a loss in competitive strength. The worth of a company is the discounted cash flows payable to the owners.

It is possible that a shift in exchange rates can reduce the cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and home-based production far into the future (and not just affect the near future cash flows as in transaction exposure). In Australia, the strength of the home currency may well lead to a fall in their cattle export trade and so curtail the foreign income received – see Exhibit 12.13.

Exhibit 12.13

# Australian cattlemen fear loss of exports

FT

Peter Smith

The 680 cattle on display at the livestock sale yards in Wodonga, an agricultural centre in southeastern Australia, are making their final appearance before being prodded on to trucks and taken to the slaughterhouse.

After much slicing and dicing, cattle parts will emerge in chilled or frozen packages to be sent around the world. The Japanese take the premium cuts, the Koreans want the short ribs, and the Americans mix lean Australian beef with their corn-fed cattle for hamburger patties.

"Big, fat cows are making A1,200," says Ross Trethowan, a livestock and wheat farmer who runs a 1,600-hectare property.

But the fifth-generation farmer also knows his livelihood is tied to the world's commodity and currency markets. And the Australian cattle industry - alongside tourism, mining and manufacturing - is likely to be one of the hardest hit by the country's strengthening currency.

Mr Trethowan is fearful about any erosion in his competitiveness due to the Australian dollar's strength. The currency on Thursday hit a new high of US0.998, its highest level against the greenback since it was floated 27 years ago, and market observers believe parity is only days away.

It keeps the price of [imported] fuel and fertiliser down, but it will damage us if it stays that strong," says Mr Trethowan. "We are still a long way behind the eight ball after those tough years of drought, so we can't afford to take a big hit."

Robert Reid, another farmer selling cattle at the auction, reckons the higher Australian dollar is already hitting the market just as greater numbers of cattle are coming up for sale.

Cattle prices have fallen by roughly 5 per cent in the past week alone, he says, and he blames that fall on the Australian dollar's rise.

"I would prefer it to be closer to US0.80. That's the right value," he says.

Australia is the world's second biggest beef exporter behind Brazil and nearly two-thirds of its beef production is destined for international markets.

However, Australia's beef export sales fell from A $5.1bn to A$ 4.2bn in the year to June, according to Meat & Livestock Australia, an industry body.

The drop of 18 per cent reflects the higher dollar, lower volumes of cattle being sold and weak economic conditions in top export markets such as Japan, according to Tim McRae, economist for Meat & Livestock Australia.

Mr McRae says the weak US dollar means that US producers have replaced those from South America as the big threat to Australian exporters.

"The two markets where Aussie and US beef exporters are slugging it out are Japan and South Korea, and we have seen a big increase in both markets by US exporters this year," he says.

"If the dollar stays high, it will make it that much harder to sell Aussie beef," Mr McRae said.

"Farmers are seeing a better return after the end of the financial crisis and after the good season, but it's not as good as it could be because of the currency," Mr Broad said.

"We already have high interest rates in Australia which are putting a brake on the agricultural sector, but the Australian dollar is putting on another brake," Mr Broad says.

John McPhee, owner of the Wodonga abattoirs, agrees that the stronger dollar has affected his business "quite dramatically".

"If you lock in sales at a US dollar rate and then the Australian dollar goes in the other direction, you are still committed to supply.

"But what it means is you will get a lot less for it than you thought."

Mr McPhee says he had to adjust to deal with the market. "You have to sell your meat, cover the price of the dollar you are paying with the bank, and then move on," he said.

There are two ways in which competitive position can be undermined by FX changes:
- Directly If your firm's home currency strengthens then foreign competitors are able to gain sales and profits at your expense because your products are more expensive in the eyes of customers both abroad and at home, or you have reduced margins.
- Indirectly Even if your home currency does not move adversely vis-à-vis your customer's currency you can lose competitive position. For example suppose a South African firm is selling into Hong Kong and its main competitor is a New Zealand firm. If the New Zealand dollar weakens against the Hong Kong dollar the South African firm has lost some competitive position.

Another indirect effect occurs even for firms which are entirely domestically oriented. For example, the cafés and shops surrounding a large export-oriented manufacturing plant may be severely affected by the closure of the factory due to an adverse forex movement.

Economic risk can badly damage a business - see Exhibit 12.14.

Hank Morrison, whose Philippine company makes model aircraft, says he could be out of business within six months if the Filipino peso continues to rally against the US dollar.

With the way the peso is going, it's become almost impossible,' he says. 'I'm not only operating at a loss but in effect the more I make the more I lose.'


As an emergency step, Mr Morrison has decided to halve his production of model aircraft, 95 per cent of which end up in America on the shelves of collectors or indus try buyers such as Boeing. That is bad news both for Mr Morrison's 60 Filipino employees and for Philippine exports.

# Transaction risk strategies

The following section illustrates a number of strategies available to deal with transaction risk by focusing on the alternatives open to an exporter selling goods on credit. By going through these options we see the practical use of the financial markets for companies.

We will use the example of a UK company exporting £1 million of goods to a Canadian firm when the spot rate of exchange is C1.60/£. The Canadian firm is given three months to pay, and naturally the spot rate in three months is unknown at the time of the shipment of goods. What can the firm do?

# Invoice the customer in the home currency

One easy way to bypass exchange-rate risk is to insist that all foreign customers pay in your currency and your firm pays for all imports in your home currency. In the case of this example the Canadian importer will be required to send £1 million in three months, and the FX markets are not involved, except for the obtaining of £1 million by the Canadian company. However, the exchange-rate risk has not gone away, it has just been passed on to the customer.

# Do nothing

Under this policy the UK firm invoices the Canadian firm for C1.6 million, waits three months and then exchanges into sterling at whatever spot rate is available then. Perhaps an exchange-rate gain will be made, perhaps a loss will be made. Many firms adopt this policy and take a 'win some, lose some' attitude. Given the fees and other transaction costs of some hedging strategies this can make sense.

There are two considerations here. The first is the degree of risk aversion to higher cash flow variability, coupled with the sensitivity of shareholders to reported fluctuations of earnings due to foreign exchange gains and losses. The second, which is related to the first point, is the size of the transaction. If £1 million is a large proportion of annual turnover, and greater than profit, then the company may be more worried about FX risk.

# Netting

Multinational companies often have subsidiaries in different countries selling to other members of the group. Netting is where the subsidiaries settle intra-organisational currency debts for the net amount owed in a currency rather than the gross amount. For example, if a UK parent owned a subsidiary in Canada and sold C\$1.6 million of goods to the subsidiary on credit while the Canadian subsidiary is owed C\$1.2 million by the UK company, instead of transferring a total of C\$2.8 million the intra-group transfer is the net amount of C\$400,000, so lessening the amount subject to currency risk – see Exhibit 12.15.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/2138381c25414eb0e11bbf8909071cb33b10dfb19fc19e73fb5777a5e15e3c0e.jpg)
Exhibit 12.15 Netting

# Matching

Netting only applies to transfers within a group of companies. Matching can be used for both intra-group transactions and those involving third parties. The company matches the inflows and outflows in different currencies caused by trade, etc., so that it is only necessary to deal on the FX markets for the unmatched portion of the total transactions. CLS settlement enables matching between members.

So if, say, the Canadian importer is not a group company and the UK firm also imported a raw material from another Canadian company to the value of C \$1.4 million it is necessary only to hedge the balance of C\$ 200,000 (see Exhibit 12.16).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/368aa8d07181735fa49119e11f103b1d526059f76979ce810eb6869e7d429eb2.jpg)
Exhibit 12.16 Matching

Naturally, to net and match properly, the timing of the expected receipts and payments would have to be the same.

# Forward market hedge

Although other forms of exchange rate risk management are available, forward cover represents the most frequently employed method of hedging. A contract is agreed to exchange two currencies at a fixed time in the future at a predetermined rate. The risk of FX variation is removed for the company taking out the contract.

So if the three-month forward rate is  \mathrm{C}\ 1.65 /  the UK exporter could lock in the receipt of  969,697 in three months by selling forward C1.6 million.

$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 6 5} = £ 9 6 9, 6 9 7

$$

No foreign exchange-rate risk now exists because the dollars to be received from the importer are matched by the funds to be exchanged for sterling. There is still a risk of the importer not paying, at all or on time, and the risk of the counterparty in the FX market not fulfilling its obligations.

# Money market hedge

Money market hedging involves borrowing in the money markets. For example, the exporter could, at the time of the export, borrow in Canadian dollars on the money markets for a three-month period. The amount borrowed, plus three months' interest, will be equal to the amount to be received from the importer (C1.6m).

If the interest rate charged over three months is, 8 per cent annualised, 2 per cent for three months, then the appropriate size of the loan is:

$$

C \ = C \ ? (1 + 0. 0 2) \quad C \ ? = \frac {C \ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 0 2} = C \ 1 , 5 6 8 , 6 2 7

$$

Thus the exporter has created a liability (borrowed funds) which matches the asset (debt owed by Canadian firm).

The borrowed dollars are then converted to sterling on the spot market for the exporter to receive £980,392 immediately:

$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 5 6 8 , 6 2 7}{1 . 6} = £ 9 8 0, 3 9 2

$$

The exporter has removed FX risk because it now holds cash in sterling three months before the debt was originally due, taking a small loss of £19,608, but this could be offset by three months' interest.

Three months later C1.6 million is received from the importer and this exactly matches the outstanding debt:

Amount borrowed + Interest = Debt owed at end of period

$$

C \1,568,627 + (C \1,568,627 \times 0.02) = £ 1.6 m

$$

The five steps in the money market hedge are as shown in Exhibit 12.17.

An importer could also use a money market hedge. A Swiss company importing Japanese cars for payment in yen in three months could borrow in Swiss francs now and convert the funds at the spot rate into yen. This money is deposited to earn interest, with the result that after three months the principal plus interest equals the invoice amount.

# Futures hedge

A foreign currency futures contract is an agreement to exchange a specific amount of a currency for another at a fixed future date for a predetermined price. Futures are similar to forwards in many ways. They are, however, standardised contracts traded on regulated exchanges. Forwards can be tailor-made in a wide range of currencies with variable amounts of currency and delivery

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/0e902a5ec17df63c3b1ed3e2b2891ee4a92a6c429dc38a10b1d84045622afcaa.jpg)
Exhibit 12.17 The five steps in the money market hedge dates, whereas futures are only available in a limited range of currencies and for a few specific forward time periods – see Chapter 10.


The vast majority of futures market trading in currencies is through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and ICE Futures US, formerly NYBOT, the New York Board of Trade, which is now part of the Intercontinental Exchange group. The CME, for example, deals in 49 futures and 32 options contracts on 20 currencies.

A single futures contract is for a fixed amount of currency. For example, the sterling contract is for £62,500. It is not possible to buy or sell a smaller amount than this, nor to transact in quantities other than whole-number multiples of this. To buy a sterling futures contract is to make a commitment to deliver a quantity of US dollars and receive in return £62,500. One contract for euros is for €125,000.

On 3 December 2010 the CME and NYBOT quoted contracts (shown at www.ft.com) for delivery in December 2010 and February and March 2011 – see Exhibit 12.18. For example, the March contract for euros and US$ was priced at 1.3369 at the end of the trading day (the 'Open' column indicates the rate at the start of trading on 3 December, the 'Sett' column indicates closing prices.) This means that if you buy one contract you are committed to deliver US\$1.3369 for every euro of the €125,000 you will receive in late March, that is US\$167,113. If you sold one contract at 1.3369 you would deliver €125,000 and receive US\$167,113.

A firm hedging with currency futures will usually attempt to have a futures position that has an equal and opposite profit profile to the underlying transaction. Frequently the futures position will be closed before delivery is due, to give a cash profit or loss to offset the spot market profit or loss (for more details on futures see Chapter 10) – although physical delivery of the currency is possible.

To illustrate, if a US firm exports €125,000 worth of goods to a German firm on 3 December 2010 on four months' credit for payment in late March and the current spot exchange rate is US\$1.3154/€ there is a foreign exchange risk. If the March future is trading at a price of US\$1.3369 per euro the exporter's position could be hedged by selling one euro futures contract on CME.

If in March the euro falls against the dollar to US1.10/€ the calculation is:

Value of €125,000 received from customer when US137,500 converted to dollars at spot in March (€125,000 × 1.10)

Amount if exchange rate was constant at US $1.3154/€ US$ 164,425 Forex loss -US26,925

However, an offsetting gain is made on the futures contract:

Sold at US $1.3369/€ (€125,000 × 1.3369) US$ 167,112.50

Bought in March to close position at US $1.10/€ (€125,000 × 1.10) US$ 137,500.00 Forex loss +US29,612.50

Alternatively the exporter could simply deliver the €125,000 received from the importer to CME in return for US167,112.50

In the above example a perfect hedge was not achieved because the gain on the futures contract did not exactly equate to the loss on the underlying position (i.e. the euros to be received from the German customer). Perfect hedging is frequently unobtainable with futures because of their standardised nature which limits the amount (multiples of €125,000, for example) and timing (the underlying transaction takes place on a date where there is no future).

# Currency option hedge

The final possible course of action to reduce FX transaction risk to be discussed in this chapter is to make use of the currency option market.

A currency option is a contract giving the buyer (that is, the holder) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of currency at a specific exchange rate (the strike price), on or before a specified future date.

A put option gives the right to sell a particular currency

The option writer (usually a bank) guarantees, if the option buyer chooses to exercise the right, to exchange the currency at the predetermined rate. Because the writer is accepting risk the buyer must pay a premium to the writer – normally within two business days of the option purchase. (For more details on options see Chapter 11.)

Exhibit 12.19 shows the currency options premiums for the currency rates between the pound GBP and the US dollar USD. This data is taken from the website of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on 29 December 2010 as trading is taking place.

For the GBP/USD call options the purchaser has the right but not the obligation to purchase pounds for dollars. Potential call option buyers have a number of possible rates of exchange open to them. The exhibit shows strike prices of  $1.5200/$  to  $\$ 1.5600/$  in the first column. The premiums payable, shown in the third column, are quoted as US dollars per pound. One contract is for  $\pounds 62,500$ , and only whole numbers of contracts on the exchange may be purchased. If you purchased a 15200 call option for expiry in March you would pay a premium of 4.07 US cents per UK pound (the total premium payable would be  $\$ 0.0407 \times 62,500 =$ 2,543.75) giving you the right to buy pounds with dollars in March at a rate of  $\$ 1.52/$  Note that a less favourable exchange rate, e.g. 15600( $1.56/$ ) commands a lower premium, only 1.88 cents per pound in the contract.

The purchase of a put option gives you the right but not the obligation to sell pounds and receive dollars. Again the quantity of a contract is £62,500.

The crucial advantage an option has over a forward is the absence of an obligation to buy or sell. It is the option buyer's decision whether to insist on exchange at the strike rate or to let the option lapse.

With forwards, if the exchange rate happens to move in your favour after you are committed to a forward contract you cannot take any advantage of that movement. We saw above that if the forward rate was  $C\$  1.65/\text{£} $the exporter would receive$ \ $969,697 in three months. If the spot exchange rate had moved to, say,$ C\ 1.5/\text{£} $over the three months the exporter would have liked to abandon the agreement to sell the dollars at$ C\ $1.65/\text{£}$ , but is unable to do so because of the legal commitment. With an option there is always the possibility of abandoning the deal and exchanging at spot. When the Canadian firm pays the exporter would receive an income of:


$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 5} = £ 1, 0 6 6, 6 6 7

$$

This is an extra £96,970.

An option permits:
- hedging against unfavourable currency movement;
- profit from favourable currency movement.

# Worked example 12.4 Currency option contract

Now, imagine that the UK exporting firm, when the goods are delivered to the Canadian firm, hedges by buying a three-month sterling call option giving the right but not the obligation to deliver Canadian dollars to a bank in exchange for pounds with a strike price of C\ 1.65 / £. A premium will need to be paid up front. Assume this is 2 per cent of the amount covered, that is, a non-refundable 0.02 \times C\ 1,600,000 = C\ 32,000 is payable two business days after the option deal is struck.

# Three months later

The dollars are delivered by the importer on the due date. Should the option at C1.65/£ be exercised? Let us consider two scenarios.

# Scenario 1

The dollar has strengthened against the pound to C\$1.5/£. If the company exercises the right to exchange at C\$1.65/£ the UK firm will receive:

$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 6 5} = £ 9 6 9, 6 9 7

$$

If the company lets the option lapse – ‘abandons it’ – and exchanges the dollars in the spot market, the amount received will be:

$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 5} = £ 1, 0 6 6, 6 6 7

$$ an extra £96,970.


Clearly, in this case the best course of action would be to abandon the option, and exchange at the spot rate.

# Scenario 2

Now assume that the dollar has weakened against sterling to C\ 1.8/ If the treasurer contacts the bank (the option writer) to confirm that the exporter wishes to exercise the C\ 1.65/ option the treasurer will arrange delivery of C\1,600,000 to the bank and will receive £969,697 in return:

$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 6 5} = £ 9 6 9, 6 9 7

$$

If the option is abandoned and the C1.6 million is sold in the spot FX market, the amount received will be:

$$

\frac {C \$ 1 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 8} = £ 8 8 8, 8 8 9

$$ a loss of £80,808. This is unattractive and so the option will be exercised.


With the option, the worst that could happen is that the exporter receives £969,697 less the premium. However, the upside potential is unconstrained.

Option contracts are generally for sums greater than US1,000,000 on the OTC market (direct deals with banks) whereas one contract on the CME is, for example, for £62,500. The drawback with exchange-based derivatives is the smaller range of currencies available and the inability to tailor-made a hedging position.

# Managing translation risk

The effect of translation risk on the balance sheet can be lessened by matching the currency of assets and liabilities. For example, Graft plc has decided to go ahead with a US \$190 million project in the US. One way of financing this is to borrow\$ 100 million and exchange this for dollars at the current exchange rate of US1.9/£. Thus, at the beginning of the year the additional entries into the consolidated accounts are as shown in worked example 12.5.

# Worked example 12.5 Translation risk

Opening balance sheet

<table><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td colspan="3">Assets</td></tr><tr><td>Loan</td><td>£100m</td><td>US assets</td><td>£100m</td></tr></table>

The US\$190 million of US assets are translated at US\$1.9/£ so all figures are expressed in the parent company's currency.

Now imagine that over the course of the next year the dollar depreciates against sterling to US \$2.30/£. In the consolidated group accounts there is still a £100 million loan but the asset bought with that loan, while still worth US\$ 190 million,4 is valued at only £82.61 million when translated into sterling. In the parent company's currency terms, £17.39 million needs to be written off:

Year-end balance sheet

<table><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td colspan="3">Assets</td></tr><tr><td>Loan</td><td>£100.00m</td><td>US assets</td><td>£82.61m</td></tr><tr><td>Forex loss</td><td>-£17.39m</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Alternatively Graft plc could finance its dollar assets by obtaining a dollar loan. Thus, when the dollar depreciates, both the asset value and the liability value in translated sterling terms become less.

Opening balance sheet

<table><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td colspan="3">Assets</td></tr><tr><td>Loan</td><td>£100m</td><td>US assets</td><td>£100m</td></tr></table>

If forex rates move to US2.30/£:

Year-end balance sheet

<table><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td colspan="3">Assets</td></tr><tr><td>Loan</td><td>£82.61m</td><td>US assets</td><td>£82.61m</td></tr></table>

There is no currency loss to deal with.

One constraint on the solution set out in worked example 12.5 is that some governments insist that a proportion of assets acquired within their countries is financed by the parent firm. Another constraint is that the financial markets in some countries are insufficiently developed to permit large-scale borrowing.

# Managing economic risk

Economic exposure is concerned with the long-term effects of forex movements on a firm's ability to compete and add value. These effects are very difficult to estimate in advance, given their long-term nature, and therefore the hedging techniques described for transaction risk are of limited use. The forwards markets may be used to a certain extent, but these only extend for a short period for most currencies. Also the matching principle could be employed, whereby overseas assets are matched as far as possible by overseas liabilities.

The main method of insulating the firm from economic risk is to position the company in such a way as to maintain maximum flexibility – to be able to react to changes in FX rates which may be causing damage to the firm. Firms which are internationally diversified may have a greater degree of flexibility than those based in one or two markets. For example, a company with production facilities in numerous countries can shift output to those plants where the exchange rate change has been favourable. The international car assemblers have an advantage here over the purely domestic producer.

Forex changes can impact on the costs of raw materials and other inputs. By maintaining flexibility in sourcing supplies a firm could achieve a competitive advantage by deliberately planning its affairs so that it can switch suppliers quickly and cheaply.

An aware multinational could allow for forex changes when deciding in which countries to launch an advertising campaign. For example, it may be pointless increasing marketing spend in a country whose currency has depreciated rapidly recently, making the domestically-produced competing product relatively cheap.

# Exchange rate determination

A number of factors influence the rate of exchange between currencies. This section briefly considers some of them.

# Purchasing power parity theory

The theory of purchasing power parity (PPP) is based on the idea that a basket of traded goods should cost the same regardless of the currency in which it is sold. For example, if a basket of traded goods sold for 10,000 in the UK and an identical 'basket' sold for US15,000 in the USA then the rate of exchange should be US1.50/£. Imagine what would happen if this were not the case; say, for example, the rate of exchange was US3.00/£. Now British consumers can buy a basket of traded goods in the US market for half the price they would pay in the UK market (5,000 can now be exchanged for US15,000). Naturally the demand for dollars would rise as UK consumers rushed out of sterling to buy dollars. This would cause the FX rates to change – the dollar would rise in value until the purchasing power of each currency was brought to an equilibrium, that is, where there is no incentive to exchange currencies to take advantage of lower prices abroad because of a misaligned exchange rate.

The definition of PPP is:

Exchange rates are in equilibrium when their domestic purchasing powers at that rate of exchange are equal.

So, for example:

<table><tr><td>Price of a basket of goods in UK in sterling</td><td>×</td><td>US$/£ exchange rate</td><td>=</td><td>Price of a basket of goods in USA in dollars</td></tr><tr><td>£10,000</td><td>×</td><td>1.50</td><td>=</td><td>US\$15,000</td></tr></table>

The PPP theory becomes more interesting if relationships over a period of time are examined. Inflation in each country will affect the price of a basket of goods in domestic currency terms. This in turn will influence the exchange rate between currencies with different domestic inflation rates.

Let us suppose that sterling and the US dollar are at PPP equilibrium at the start of the year with rates at US1.50/£. Then over the year the inflation rate in the UK is 15 per cent so the same basket costs £11,500 at the end of the year. If during the same period US prices rise by 3 per cent the US domestic cost of a basket will be US15,450. If the exchange rate remains at US\$1.50/£ there will be a disequilibrium and PPP is not achieved. A UK consumer is faced with a choice of either buying £11,500 of UK-produced goods or exchanging £11,500 into dollars and buying US goods. The consumer's £11,500 will buy US17,250 at US\$1.50/£. This is more than one basket; therefore the best option is to buy goods in the US. The buying pressure on the dollar will shift exchange rates to a new equilibrium in which a basket costs the same price in both countries. To find this new equilibrium exchange rate we could use the following formula:

$$

\frac {1 + I _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + I _ {\mathrm {U K}}} = \frac {\mathrm {U S} \\ / \\ \mathbb {S} \\ / \\ £ _ {0}}{\mathrm {U S} \\ / \\ £ _ {0}}

$$ where:  $I_{\mathrm{US}} =$  US inflation rate;

$I_{\mathrm{UK}} = \mathrm{UK}$  inflation rate;

\mathrm{US\ / £_{1} =} the spot rate of exchange at the end of the period;

\mathrm{US\ / £_0} = \text{the spot rate of exchange at the beginning of the period.}

$$
\frac {1 + 0 . 0 3}{1 + 0 . 1 5} = \frac {\mathrm {U S} \mathbb {S} / \mathbb {E} _ {1}}{1 . 5 0}
$$

$$
U S \mathbb {S} / £ _ {1} = \frac {1 + 0 . 0 3}{1 + 0 . 1 5} x 1. 5 0 = 1. 3 4 3 5
$$

The US dollar appreciates against the pound by 10.43 per cent because inflation is lower in the US over the period.

At this new exchange rate a basket of goods costing US \$15,450 in the US has a sterling cost of 15,450/1.3435 =\$ 11,500 and thus PPP is maintained.

The pure PPP concludes that the country with the higher inflation rate will be subject to a depreciation of its currency, and the extent of that depreciation is proportional to the relative difference in the two countries' inflation rates. However, the theory is most valid for countries which are both geographically and demographically close. The PPP theory has some serious problems when applied in practice:

- It applies only to goods freely traded internationally at no cost of trade. Many goods and services do not enter international trade and so their relative prices are not taken into account in the determination of currency rates. Medical services, haircuts, building and live entertainment, to name but a few, are rarely imported; therefore they are not subject to PPP. The theory also has limited applicability to goods with a high transportation cost relative to their value, for example road stone or cement. The PPP disequilibrium would have to be very large to make it worthwhile importing products of this kind. There may also be barriers inhibiting trade, for example regulations, tariffs, quotas, cultural resistance.
- It works in the long run, but that may be years away Customers may be slow to recognise the incentive to purchase from another country when there is a PPP disequilibrium. There is usually some inertia due to buying habits that have become routine. Furthermore, governments may manage exchange rates for a considerable period, thus defying the forces pressing toward PPP. In addition, in the short term there are other elements at play such as balance of payments disequilibria, capital transactions (purchase of assets such as factories, businesses or shares by foreigners) and speculation.

The evidence is that relative inflation is one influence on exchange rates, but it is not the only factor. There have been large deviations from PPP for substantial periods.

The OECD uses its resources to produce continuously updated statistics indicating what the exchange should be for a representative basket of goods to cost 100 units of domestic currency. Another set of statistics and a far simpler indicator of currency discrepancies is the 'Big Mac Index', initiated by The Economist, which compares the price of a Big Mac in different countries – see Exhibit 12.20.

# Why China needs more expensive burgers

The Economist, 14 October 2010

A WEAK currency, despite its appeal to exporters and politicians, is no free lunch. But it can provide a cheap one. In China, for example, a McDonald's Big Mac costs just 14.5 yuan on average in Beijing and Shenzhen, the equivalent of  \$2.18 at market exchange rates. In America, in contrast, the same burger averages\$ 3.71.

That makes China's yuan one of the most undervalued currencies in the Big Mac index, our gratifyingly simple guide to currency misalignments, updated this week (see chart). The index is based on the idea of purchasing-power parity, which says that a currency's price should reflect the amount of goods and services it can buy. Since 14.5 yuan can buy as much burger as  \$3.71, a yuan should be worth\$ 0.26 on the foreign-exchange market. In fact, it cost \$0.15, suggesting that it is undervalued by about 40\%. The tensions caused by such misalignments prompted Brazil's finance minister, Guido Mantega, to complain last month that his country was a potential casualty of a 'currency war'. Perhaps it was something he ate. In Brazil a Big Mac costs the equivalent of \$5.26, implying that the real is now overvalued by 42\%. The index also suggests that the euro is overvalued by about 29\%. And the Swiss, who avoid most wars, are in the thick of this one. Their franc is the most expensive currency on our list. The Japanese are so far the only rich country to intervene directly in the markets to weaken their currency. But according to burgernomics, the yen is only 5 per cent overvalued, not much of a casus belli. If a currency war is in the offing, America's congressmen seem increasingly determined to arm themselves. A bill passed by the House of Representatives last month would treat undervalued currencies as an illegal export subsidy and allow American firms to request countervailing tariffs. The size of those tariffs would reflect the scale of the undervaluation.

How does the bill propose to calculate this misalignment? It relies not on Big Macs, but on the less digestible methods favoured by the IMF. The fund uses three related approaches. First, it calculates the

The fund's second approach ignores current-account balances and instead calculates a direct statistical relationship between the real exchange rate and things like a country's terms of trade (the price of its exports compared with its imports), its productivity and its foreign assets and liabilities. The strength of Brazil's currency, for example, may partly reflect the high price of exports such as soyabean.

Third, the fund also calculates the exchange rate that would stabilise the country's foreign assets and liabilities at a reasonable level. If, for example, a country runs sizeable trade surpluses, resulting in a rapid build-up of foreign assets, it probably has an undervalued exchange rate.

The IMF has typically assessed its members' policies one at a time. But the fund's managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, now proposes to assess its biggest members all at once to make sure their macroeconomic strategies do not work at cross-purposes. He is keen to identify the ways in which a country's policies, including its exchange-rate policies, 'spill over' to its neighbours.

Those spillovers depend on the size of the economy as much as the scale of any misalignments. But the biggest economies are also the hardest to bully. The fund's last annual report on the Chinese economy, in July, included the government's rebuttal of every criticism the fund offered. In a decorous compromise the report concluded that the yuan was 'substantially' undervalued but refrained from quantifying the size of the problem.

Big revaluations of the kind required to satisfy the fund or equalise the price of burgers are unlikely. A recent study of the Big Mac index by Kenneth Clements, Yihui Lan and Shi Pei Seah of the University of Western Australia showed that misalignments are remarkably persistent. As a result, the raw index did a poor job of predicting exchange rates: undervalued currencies remain too cheap and overvalued currencies remain too costly.

But since this bias is systematic, it can be identified and removed. Once that is done, the three economists show that a reconstituted index is good at predicting real exchange rates over horizons of a year or more. Since The Economist costs just 6.99 (a little less than two burgers) on the news-stand, the index provides decent value for money for would-be currency speculators, the authors conclude. The Big Mac index may itself be undervalued.

# Interest rate parity theory

While PPP is concerned with differences in spot rates at different points in time and relating these to inflation rates, the interest rate parity (IRP) theory concerns the relationship between spot rates and forward rates, and links differences between these to the nominal interest rates available in each of the two currencies.

The interest rate parity theory holds true when the difference between spot and forward exchange rates is equal to the differential between interest rates available in the two currencies.

The theory behind IRP predicts that if you place your money in a currency with a high interest rate you will be no better off when you convert the sum back into your home currency via a prearranged forward transaction than if you had simply invested in a domestic interest-bearing investment carrying a similar risk. What you gain on the extra interest you lose on the difference between spot and forward exchange rates.

For example, suppose a UK investor is attracted by the 8 per cent interest rate being offered on one-year US government bonds. This compares well with the similarly very low risk one-year UK government bond offering 6 per cent interest. The IRP theory says that this investor will not achieve an extra return by investing abroad rather than at home because the one-year forward rate of exchange will cause the US$ to be at a discount relative to the present spot rate. Thus, when the investment matures and the dollars are converted to sterling the investor will have achieved the same as if the money had been invested in UK government bonds.

Consider these steps:

1 Beginning of year

Exchange £1 million for US\$1.5 million at the spot rate of US\$1.5/£.

Buy US1.5 million government bonds yielding 8 per cent.

Arrange a one-year forward transaction at US1.5283/£ to sell dollars.

# 2 End of year

Exchange US1.62 million (US1.5 million × 1.08 to include added interest) with the bank which agreed the forward exchange at the beginning of the year at the rate 1.5283 to produce 1.62m ÷ 1.5283 = £1.06 million. This is equal to the amount that would have been received by investing in UK government bonds, 6 per cent over the year. The differential between the spot and forward rates exactly offsets the difference in interest rates.

The formula which links together the spot, forward and interest rate differences is:

$$
\frac {1 + r _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + r _ {\mathrm {U K}}} = \frac {\mathrm {U S} \\ / \\ \mathbb {S} \\ / \\ \mathbb {S} - \mathbb {E} _ {F}}{\mathrm {U S} \\ / \\ \mathbb {S} - \mathbb {E} _ {S}}
$$ where:  $r_{\mathrm{US}} =$  interest rate available in the USA;


$r_{UK} =$  interest rate available in the UK (for the same risk);

$\overline{\mathrm{U}}\overline{\mathrm{S}}\underline{\mathrm{S}} /\underline{\mathrm{E}}_{\mathrm{F}} =$  the forward exchange rate;

\mathrm{US\ / £_{S} =} the spot exchange rate.

To test this relationship consider the case where both the spot rate and the forward rate are at US1.50/£. Here the investor can prearrange to convert the dollar investment back into sterling through a forward agreement and obtain an extra 2 per cent by investing in the US. However, the investor will not be alone in recognising this remarkable opportunity. Companies, forex dealers and fund managers will turn to this type of trading. They would sell UK bonds, buy dollars spot, buy US bonds and sell dollars forward. This would quickly lead us away from disequilibrium as the pressure of these transactions would lower UK bond prices and therefore raise interest rates, cause a rise in the value of the spot dollar against sterling, a rise in the price of US bonds and therefore a fall in interest rates being offered and a fall in the dollar forward rate. These adjustments will eliminate the investment return differences and re-establish IRP equilibrium.

The IRP insists that the relationship between exchange and interest rates is as follows:
- High nominal interest rate currency Currency trades at a discount on the forward rate compared with spot rate.
- Low nominal interest rate currency Currency trades at a premium on the forward rate compared with spot rate.

The IRP theory generally holds true in practice. However, there are deviations caused by factors such as taxation (which alters the rate of return earned on investments), or government controls on capital flows, controls on currency trading and intervention in foreign exchange markets interfering with the attainment of equilibrium through arbitrage.

The article in Exhibit 12.21 describes two types of IRP.

# Exhibit 12.21

# Carry on speculating

# How traders have been triumphing over economic theory

No comment on the financial markets these days is complete without mention of the 'carry trade', the borrowing or selling of currencies with low interest rates and the purchase of currencies with high rates. The trade is often blamed for the weakness of the Japanese yen and the unexpected enthusiasm of investors for the New Zealand and Australian dollars.

But why does the carry trade work? In theory, it shouldn't – or not for as long as it has. Foreign-exchange markets operate under a state of 'covered interest parity'. In other words, the difference between two countries' interest rates is exactly reflected in the gap between the spot, or current, exchange rate and the forward market. High-interest-rate currencies are at a discount in the forward market; low-rate currencies at a premium.

If that were not so, it would be possible for a Japanese investor to sell yen, buy dollars, invest those dollars at high American interest rates for 12 months and simultaneously sell the dollars forward for yen to lock in a profit in a year's time. The potential for arbitrage means such profits cannot be earned.

However, economic theory also suggests that 'uncovered interest parity' should operate. Countries that offer high interest rates should be compensating investors for the risk that their currency will depreciate. In other words, the forward rate should be a good guess of the likely future spot rate.

In the real world, uncovered interest parity has not applied over the past 25 years or so. A recent academic study* has shown that high-rate currencies have tended to appreciate and low-rate currencies to depreciate, the reverse of theory. Carry-trade strategies would have brought substantial profits, not far short of stockmarket returns, although dealing costs would have limited the size of the bets traders could make.

Academics have struggled for some time to explain this discrepancy. One possibility is that investors demand a risk premium, separate from the better interest rate, to compensate them for investing in a foreign currency. As this risk premium varies, it might overwhelm the effects of interest-rate changes. For example, American investors might worry about the credibility of the Bank of Japan, but Japanese investors may regard the dollar as a 'safe haven'. This would drive the dollar up and the yen down.

However, according to Andrew Scott, of the London Business School, it has been a struggle to find risk premiums that are large enough to explain exchange-rate volatility. So academics have been looking at the structure of foreign-exchange markets, to see if behavioural factors might be at work.

One obvious possibility is that the actions of carry traders are self-fulfilling; when they borrow the yen and buy the dollar, they drive the former down and the latter up. If other investors follow 'momentum' strategies – jumping on the bandwagon of existing trends – this would tend to push up currencies with high interest rates.

# Financial jaywalking

Such a strategy has its dangers. It has been likened to 'picking up nickels in front of steamrollers': you have a long run of small gains but eventually get squashed. In the currency markets, this would mean a steady series of profits from the interest-rate premium that are all wiped out by a large, sudden shift in exchange rates: think of the pound's exit from the European exchange-rate mechanism in 1992. The foreign-exchange markets have been remarkably calm since the Asian crisis of 1998 (when the yen rose sharply, hitting many carry traders). So a whole generation of investors may have grown up in a state of blissful innocence, unaware that their carry strategy has severe dangers.

Inflation may provide an alternative explanation. The theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP) implies that high-inflation currencies should depreciate, relative to harder monies. In other words, while nominal exchange rates might vary, real rates should be pretty constant. And over the very long term, this seems to happen. A study by the London Business School†, with ABN Amro, a Dutch bank, found that real exchange rates in 17 countries moved by less than an average of 0.2 per cent a year over the period 1900–2006.

Other things being equal (such as roughly similar real interest rates across countries) nominal interest rates should be higher in countries with higher inflation rates. So this should give support to uncovered-interest parity and deter the carry trade. Clearly, though, PPP has not been a useful guide over the past ten years, as the deflation-prone yen has declined against the dollar.

Perhaps the success of the carry trade reflects biases built up in an earlier era, during the inflationary 1970s and 1980s. Currencies prone to inflation back then, such as sterling and the dollar, have had to pay higher interest rates to compensate investors for their reputation. In fact, because inflation has declined, investors in Britain and America have been overcompensated for the risks – a windfall gain that has been exploited by followers of the carry trade. However, it is hard to believe that this effect could have lasted for as long as it has. So the reasons for the success of the carry trade remain a bit of a mystery.

What does seem plain, however, is that the carry trade tends to break down when markets become more turbulent. In such conditions, those who borrowed yen to borrow to buy other assets (such as emerging-market shares) might face a double blow as the yen rose while asset prices fell. If the turbulence were sufficiently large, many years' worth of profits from the carry trade might be wiped out. A steamroller could yet restore the reputation of economic theory.

# Expectations theory

The expectations theory states that the current forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the spot rate at that point in the future.

Note that the theory does not say that the forward rate predicts precisely what spot rates will be in the future; it is merely an unbiased predictor or provides the statistical expectation. The forward rate will frequently underestimate the actual future spot rate. However, it will also frequently overestimate the actual future spot rate. On (a statistical) average, however, it predicts the future spot rate because it neither consistently under- nor consistently over-estimates.

Traders in foreign currency nudge the market towards the fulfilment of the expectations theory. If a trader takes a view that the forward rate is lower than the expected future spot price there is an incentive to buy forward. Then when the forward matures and the trader's view on the spot rate turns out to be correct the trader is able to buy at a low price and immediately sell at spot to make a profit. The buying pressure on the forward raises the price until equilibrium occurs, in which the forward price equals the market consensus view on the future spot price, which is an unbiased predictor.

The general conclusions from empirical studies investigating the truthfulness of the expectations theory is that for the more widely traded currencies it generally works well. However, there may be numerous periods when relative interest rates (under IRP theory) are the dominant influence. The forward rate can be taken to be unbiased as a predictor of the future spot rate, that is, it has an equal chance of being below or of being above the actual spot rate. However, it is a poor predictor – sometimes it is wide of the mark in one direction and sometimes wide of the mark in the other.

This knowledge may be useful to companies contemplating whether to hedge through using forward rates, with the attendant transaction costs, on a regular basis or whether to adopt a 'do nothing' policy, accepting that sometimes one loses on forex and sometimes one wins. For a firm with numerous transactions, the future spot rate will average the same as the forward rate, and so the 'do nothing' policy may be the cheaper and more attractive option.

# The influence of a current account deficit and capital flows

Another influence on exchange rate movements is the presence or otherwise of an unsustainable balance of payments. If an economy is importing more goods and services than it is exporting it is said to have a current-account deficit. The exchange rate will move (in theory) so as to achieve current-account balance. So, an overvalued exchange rate makes exporting difficult and encourages home consumers to buy goods produced in other countries. If the exchange rate then declines exporters can sell more abroad and consumers are more likely to purchase the domestically produced version of a product as it becomes cheaper relative to imported goods. The trade deficit is eventually eliminated through this mechanism. The Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate (FEER) is the exchange rate that results in a sustainable current-account balance. Any movement away from the FEER is a disequilibrium that sets in train forces that tend to bring the exchange rate back to equilibrium. That is the theory. In reality, there are many factors other than the trade balance causing forex rates to move.

Only around 1 per cent of all FX transactions are related to imports and exports of goods and services. Exchange rates can diverge from FEER for many years if foreign investors are willing to continue to finance a current-account deficit. They do this by buying assets (bonds, shares, companies, property, etc.) in the country with the negative balance of payments. The main influence on these capital transfers of money (and therefore demand for the deficit country's currency) is investors' expectations regarding the returns available on financial assets. If investors believe that the economy with a current-account deficit nevertheless offers good future returns on the bond market or the equity market, say, they will still bid up the value of its currency as they buy it to invest.

In the period 2000-2004 the US ran a very large current-account deficit and yet the currency did not fall in value. Foreign investors thought that the returns offered on US financial assets, particularly shares, were attractive and so continued to support the dollar as they pumped money into the economy. While the American people went on a spending spree (with expenditure higher than take-home pay), in the process buying mountains of foreign-produced goods, money flowed in as financial assets were bought, thus allowing the dollar to remain high. In the later stages of this unsustainable deficit the major buyers of US assets were Asian central banks, as countries such as China and Japan bought US Treasury bills and bonds to inject demand for dollars so that their exporters did not suffer from a rising currency against the dollar. Of course, it was widely recognised that the dollar could plummet should overseas investors ever start to believe that the US economic miracle is over (or that it was not really a productivity miracle after all) if they were to sell US financial assets, sell the dollar and move funds to somewhere else in the world offering more exciting (or safer) returns. This is what started to happen in 2004-2007. But it was halted by the financial crisis. The US was seen as a 'safe haven', and so investors around the world bought dollars to invest in US assets. Ironic, really, as it was the US mortgage market and Wall Street shenanigans that caused the crisis.

# Efficiency of FX markets

Whether the forex markets are efficient at pricing spot and forward currency rates is hotly debated. If they are efficient then speculators on average should not be able to make abnormal returns by using information to take positions. In an efficient market the best prediction of tomorrow's price is the price today, because prices move in a random walk fashion, depending on the arrival of new information. Prices adjust quickly to new information, but it is impossible to state in advance the direction of future movements because, by its nature, news is unpredictable (it might be 'bad' or it might be 'good').

If the market is efficient, any type of forecasting is a pointless exercise because any information used to predict the future will have already been processed by the market participants and be reflected in the price.

There are three levels of market efficiency:
- Weak form Historic prices and volume information is fully reflected in current prices, and therefore a trader cannot make abnormal profits by observing past price changes and trying to predict the future.
- Semi-strong form All publicly available information is fully reflected in prices, therefore abnormal profits are not available by acting on information once it is made public.
- **Strong form** Public and private (that is, available to insiders, for example those working for a central bank) information is reflected in prices.

Much empirical research has been conducted into currency market efficiency and the overall conclusion, such as it is, is that the question remains open. Some strategies, on some occasions, have produced handsome profits. On the other hand, many studies show a high degree of efficiency with little opportunity for abnormal reward. Most of the studies examine the major trading currencies of the world – perhaps there is more potential for the discovery of inefficiency in the more exotic currencies. Central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets also seems to be a cause of inefficiency.

Trying to outwit the market can be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said: "To my knowledge no model projecting movements in exchange rates is superior to tossing a coin."5

# Concluding comments

Where would we be without the ability to exchange currency so that we can buy goods and services from abroad and foreigners can buy from our country? Also, imagine how limiting it would be if we could not obtain currency to buy assets in other countries whether that be a factory, shares in companies, government bonds or merely an apartment. Life would be less rich, in more senses than one. The benefits from cross-border transactions are obvious to all of us. But perhaps the risks of exchange rate change is less obvious. Hopefully this chapter has stimulated thought on the risks and provided insight into the main techniques used to mitigate them. The FX markets, institutions and instruments provide tools we need to make life better.

# Key points and concepts

An exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another.
- The foreign exchange market grew dramatically over the last quarter of the twentieth century. About US4,000 billion is now traded each day on average. Most of this trading is between banks rather than for underlying (for example, import/export) reasons.
- Spot transaction: single outright transaction involving the exchange of two currencies at a rate agreed on the date of the contract for value or delivery (cash settlement) within two business days.
- Forward: transaction involving the exchange of two currencies at a rate agreed on the date of the contract for value or delivery (cash settlement) at some time in the future (more than two business days later).
- Foreign exchange swap (FX swap): a single deal with two parts to it. First, there is the actual exchange of two currencies on a specific date at a rate agreed at the time of the conclusion of the contract – this is usually a spot exchange. Second, there is a reverse exchange of the same two currencies at a date further in the future at a rate agreed at the time of the contract. The rates of exchange are usually different in the two parts.
- Currency swap: contract which commits two counterparties to exchange streams of interest payments in different currencies for an agreed period of time and usually to exchange principal amounts in different currencies at a pre-agreed exchange rate at maturity. A currency swaption: option to enter into a currency swap contract.
- Currency option: an option contract that gives the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a currency with another currency at a specified exchange rate during a specified period.
- Future: foreign currency futures are exchange traded forward transactions with standard contract sizes and maturity dates.
- Trading on the foreign exchange market does not have a focal position where all trading is supervised and data are collected and displayed; it is carried out in numerous locations, mostly over the counter.
- Customer direct trades: the customer (non-bank) approaches the bank without going through an intermediary.
Voice broker trades: a broker acts on behalf of a customer to deal with banks in the FX markets over the telephone (brokers can also access electronic trading platforms).
- Inter-dealer direct trades: trades between banks. These can be either via direct telephone communication or direct electronic dealing systems.
- Electronic dealing systems: banks are the main users of these systems, but there are special systems set up for customers. Some of these are run by a single bank as a 'proprietary platform'. Others are managed by a group of banks, 'multibank dealing systems'.
- Exchange rates are quoted with a bid rate (the rate at which you can buy) and an offer rate (the rate at which you can sell).
- Most currencies are quoted to four decimal places and the smallest variation used in trading is a pip which is one ten thousandth of 1 unit of currency (e.g. 1).
- A bank could fail after receiving one leg of its foreign exchange trades but before paying the other leg – this is called Herstatt risk. Continuous Linked Settlement allows PvP, payment versus payment, simultaneous settlement of both legs of trading, thereby eliminating Herstatt risk.
A cross-rate is the exchange rate of two currencies that are normally expressed in terms of a third currency, usually the US dollar.
- Fixed exchange rate regimes require the participating countries to keep their currencies held at a constant rate or within a certain percentage of an agreed rate.
Gold standard: currencies were fixed at a set price in gold.
- Bretton Woods: an exchange rate system whereby the currencies were fixed to the US dollar, which in turn was fixed to the price of gold at 35 per ounce of gold.
- Currency peg: one currency is pegged (fixed) to, say, the US dollar. It moves in line with that currency as it fluctuates against other currencies, so it is not fixed against other currencies.
- Floating FX regime: the exchange rate for a currency is governed by supply and demand.
- Managed floats or dirty floats: no official limits for the movements of their currencies but nevertheless governments sometimes intervene to prevent their currency moving too far in a certain direction.
- Forex shifts can affect: income received from abroad;

amounts paid for imports; the valuation of foreign assets and liabilities;
- the long-term viability of foreign operations;
- the acceptability of an overseas project.
- Transaction risk is the risk that transactions already entered into, or for which the firm is likely to have a commitment, in a foreign currency, will have a variable value in the home currency.
- Translation risk arises because financial data denominated in one currency then expressed in terms of another are affected by exchange rate movements.
Economic risk: Forex movements cause a decline in economic value because of a loss of competitive strength.

Transaction risk strategies:
- invoice customer in home currency;
- do nothing;
- netting;
-matching; forward market hedge;
money market hedge;
- futures hedge;
- currency option hedge.

One way of managing translation risk is to try to match foreign assets and liabilities.
The management of economic exposure requires the maintenance of flexibility with regard to manufacturing (for example, location of sources of supply), marketing (for example, advertising campaign, pricing) and finance (currency).
The purchasing power parity (PPP) theory states that exchange rates are in equilibrium when their domestic purchasing powers at that rate are equal. In an inflationary environment the relationship between two countries' inflation rates and the spot exchange rates between two points in time is (with the US and the UK as examples):

$$

\frac {1 + I _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + I _ {\mathrm {U K}}} = \frac {\mathrm {U S} \\ / E _ {1}}{\mathrm {U S} \\ / E _ {0}}

$$
- The interest rate parity (IRP) theory holds true when the difference between spot and forward exchange rates is equal to the differential between the interest rates available in the two currencies. Using the US and the UK currencies as examples:

$$

\frac {1 + r _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + r _ {\mathrm {U K}}} = \frac {\mathrm {U S} \mathbb {S} / £ _ {F}}{\mathrm {U S} \mathbb {S} / £ _ {S}}

$$

The expectations theory states that the current forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the spot rate at that point in the future.
The Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate (FEER) is the exchange rate that results in a sustainable current account balance.
- Flows of money for investment in financial assets across national borders can be an important influence on forex rates.
The currency markets are generally efficient, but there is evidence suggesting pockets of inefficiency.
