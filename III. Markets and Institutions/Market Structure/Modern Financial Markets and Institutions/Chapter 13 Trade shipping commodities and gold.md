# Chapter 13: Trade, shipping, commodities and gold

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

The financial services described in this chapter have been operating for centuries because they have satisfied such obvious needs for safe and efficient trading venues, finance to oil the wheels of trade and risk reducing tools to encourage buyers and sellers to come together. By the end of this chapter the reader should be able to: explain the techniques developed to reduce risk for companies buying or selling overseas, including documentary letters of credit, bills of exchange, banker's acceptances, forbaiting, factoring, insurance and export credit guarantees;

describe the role and importance of the Baltic Exchange in bringing shipowners and cargo owners together;

■ discuss marine insurance, Lloyd's Register group and shipping finance; describe the commodity exchanges, their role and functioning;

explain how gold is traded in London.

The trading of goods and services across national boundaries has many obvious advantages for producer and customer alike. However, this trade can be inhibited if there is insufficient finance or the risk to the seller of failure to pay is high. One way of lowering that risk is to insist that the buyer pays for the goods before they are delivered. However, little international trade can be carried out on this basis because of the raised risk to the importer of not receiving the goods or receiving lower quality goods – they simply will not accept this condition. Many financial innovations have been introduced to reduce risk for both the exporter and the importer. The first part of this chapter examines them.

Ships are usually not owned by the same organisations that own the goods which are to be transported across oceans. We therefore need some mechanism to connect shipowners and those with freight to be carried. They both need a place where they can make a deal – agree how many thousands of dollars per day to transport cargo. The financial markets assist here in both facilitating deal-making and in reducing risk for both shipowners and charterers.

Producers of foods, metals, plastics, oil and other commodities need an organised market structure in which they can, with reassurance of being paid, sell their materials either for immediate 'spot' delivery, or agree a price now for delivery in a few months from now. The buyers of these vital resources also value being able to purchase through well-regulated exchanges, where risk of non-compliance with agreements is reduced. Another risk is that of adverse market price movements over a period of time, e.g. the price of copper rises for a manufacturer. The modern financial markets facilitate hedging against market risks of this kind.

Finally, this chapter looks at the trading of a special commodity, gold. Some of the demand for gold derives from its industrial uses, but the majority is due to human affection for a metal that never rusts or tarnishes and is in short supply. We look at the operation of the world's leading trading centre in London.

## Trade

International trade consists of the import and export of goods and services using various means of transport and transfer. Figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) show the amazing growth in world trade exports and imports over the past 30 years – much faster than growth in the output of goods and services worldwide – see Exhibit 13.1.

Despite the contraction in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the recession, exports still totalled nearly 16 trillion. Note the slight difference in exports and imports – the world seems to have a trade deficit with itself! There is a black hole in the statistics, which has not been adequately explained.

For this trade to be carried out efficiently, a huge infrastructure is needed, including legal services (cross-border trading requires efficient processing of the necessary documentation), accounting, financing, transportation, as well as risk mitigation. One of the most important issues is the transfer of money overseas safely and securely, and in a way that is fair and as risk-free as possible to both sides. For companies exporting goods, how and when they receive payments for their goods is of paramount importance.

### Payment for exports

Exhibit 13.2 describes two extreme approaches to payments for exports. The following tools help to reduce risk for both the importer and exporter.

#### 1 Documentary letters of credit

These are issued by financial institutions, normally banks. In return for reassurance (evidence) that all the documents needed for the goods to be exported and imported, documents showing actual shipment of the goods ('bills of lading' - see below) and official licences, etc. are present and correct, the exporter receives full payment from the importer's bank. Obviously, the importer needs to make the arrangement with its bank beforehand and will later reimburse the bank the sum transferred to the exporter. Thus, once shipment has occurred exporters are able to receive payment for their goods in their own country from a bank, $^{1}$  even before the goods arrive at their destination. It is an important stipulation that the exporter will receive payment from the importer's bank regardless of the ability of the buyer to pay, thus the importer's bank has substituted its credit standing for that of the importer.

The importer has reassurance that payment will not have been made unless the exporter has complied with the terms and conditions of the contract to the satisfaction of its bank, and so can expect to receive the goods when they are required. The importer's bank normally arranges for a bank in the exporter's home country to transfer the money to the exporter. Thus, for a fee(s) and interest banks have made arrangements so that neither the importer nor the exporter need accept high risk with regard to payment. However, the risk to the importer of receiving goods from the exporter of lower quality than those stated in the documents remains.

# Exhibit 13.2 Payment from the exporter's point of view

# Exporter

Least risk

Prepayment. The least risky method of payment from an exporter's point of view is payment in advance or payment on shipment. No credit is granted. This is the least attractive option for the importer; the goods may not arrive, they may not be as ordered or they may be faulty. Cash becomes tied-up for a considerable period before the goods are received. Also there is a stigma for the importer for being perceived as less than creditworthy. This form of trading is rare in international trade.

# Importer

Most risk

# Exporter

More risk

Open account trading leaves the exporter open to more risk because goods are shipped with payment required either on receipt of the goods or at a set time in the future, normally 30, 60 or 90 days. The risk is that the importer will default and not pay. Also, the exporter has large amounts of money tied-up. Ways to mitigate this risk are factoring, forbaiting and credit insurance - discussed below. When dealing with large, well-known companies with good reputations for probity, or long-time trading partners where there is a high degree of mutual trust, the risk of default is small and so exporters are content with the reputations of their overseas customers and conduct business this way. But for many exporters open account trading is not acceptable and financial services are needed to lower risk exposure.

# Importer

Less risk

## 2 Bills of exchange and banker's acceptances

Bills of exchange and banker's acceptances were explained in Chapter 5. They are legal documents detailing the amount owing with a promise to pay on the due date. Bills of exchange are drawn up by the exporter (more usually its bank) and then signed by the importer which commits it to paying a sum of money on the due date which may be immediate (a sight draft) or say 90 days later (a time draft).

Bills of exchange do not provide as much protection for the exporter as documentary letters of credit because it is the importer that is providing the promise to pay rather than a bank. Once signed the bill is returned to the exporter, who may hold on until expiry to receive payment or sell in an active discount market for slightly less than its face value if it is a negotiable instrument -- some are not saleable/negotiable. The bill of exchange provides written evidence of the importer accepting an obligation to pay in a standard form and so the exporter's risk is reduced compared with open account trading. It is further reduced because the exporter can (usually) sell the bill and receive cash quickly.

To provide greater security for an exporter a similar document to pay a sum of money in the future may be drawn up, but this time the importer asks its bank to sign and accept the obligation. This is a banker's acceptance, or more properly in this context, a trade acceptance. These banker's acceptances (banker's drafts) are usually highly marketable so they too can be sold at a discount before the stated redemption date. Bills of exchange and banker's acceptances usually require shipping documentation to be provided. This consists of the exporter supplying a bill of lading (a document issued by a carrier to an exporter or its bank confirming that the goods have been received by the carrier, that the carrier accepts responsibility to deliver the goods to the importer and evidence of ownership of the goods), insurance certificates and commercial invoices. The documents are passed to the importer, which enables it to claim ownership after it has paid (accepting a time draft/bill that is payable immediately) or it has provided a bill of exchange or banker's acceptance for payment at a later date.

Documents are usually handled by both the exporter's and importer's banks on their behalf to provide both professionalism and reassurance to the other side. The risk to the importer of receiving goods from the exporter of lower quality than those stated in the documents remains. Trading using bills of exchange and banker's acceptances is more expensive than prepayment or open account trading, but less expensive than documentary letters of credit.

## 3 Forfaiting

If an exporter holds a series of promissory notes (indicating acceptance of an obligation to pay in the future) from the importer guaranteeing that it will pay amounts at say six-monthly intervals over the next four years then this series of rights can be sold to a forbaiting company at a discount. The forfaiter then assumes responsibility for collecting the debts as they fall due. Because the forfaiter pays for the notes straightaway the exporter now has finance for production. For additional safety the promissory notes are usually guaranteed by the importer's bank. The forfaiter may keep the notes until payment is due, or they may sell them on in the financial markets. The exporter receives guaranteed payment for their goods less the fee/discount charged by the forbaiting company. The importer obtains extended credit. Forfaiting deals are large transactions of a value in excess of  $250,000$  and are non-recourse, i.e. the exporter will not be called on by the forfaiter to make up the difference should an importer or its bank fail to pay. Forfaiters are usually part of large banks.

## 4 Factoring

Factoring was dealt with in Chapter 3. In return for a fee, factors agree to collect customer credit payments that are due to a company. The company receives immediately say 80 per cent of its outstanding trade debtor balance from the factor, with the remainder handed over when the factor receives full payment of the debt from the importer. Factors charge fees and interest on outstanding balances. Companies are able to take advantage of the advanced receipt of cash, and the risk of non-payment is negated because the factor usually takes on the risk of failure of the importer to pay. A disadvantage may be that the factor could adopt aggressive tactics to get paid by the importer which may damage relationships with a customer. Factors work with other factors in relevant countries who help with assessing the importer's creditworthiness and the handling of the collection of payments.

## 5 Insurance and guarantees

While there can be no absolute guarantee that trading will proceed smoothly, there are checks and arrangements that trading companies can make to ensure that trading transactions are as well-organised and legally watertight as possible. An exporting company will perform checks on the creditworthiness of their customers, looking into their financial history for any evidence of problems and making sure that they are a bona fide trading company in their own country. Furthermore, international shipments are generally insured because of the vulnerability of the goods to damage or complete loss should say a ship sink or a container be lost overboard. Marine insurance, which will cover fire, collision, sinking, etc., is discussed later in the chapter and in Chapter 4.

Many countries operate government-backed export credit guarantee schemes which provide insurance for exporters so that they will not suffer loss if their overseas customer defaults or if for any other reason the exporter or its bank is not paid. The fee charged to the exporter is related to the risk involved. The guarantee is often so well respected in the financial markets that when it is in place banks and others become willing to lend for an export transaction where they might otherwise have declined. Banks are often offered a guarantee of 100 per cent repayment, which means that they will reduce the interest rate charged on finance to exporters.

Political risk can occur if the government of the importing country changes rules and regulations (e.g. expropriation of assets, restrictions on remittances of profits back home, price controls) or becomes unstable (e.g. civil unrest, war) or if the domestic currency is prone to excess fluctuation. The export credit guarantee schemes usually provide insurance against political risk.

## Shipping

A broad definition of shipping includes all types of transport overseas, whether by air, sea, railway or road. However, we will concentrate here on ocean-going ships. Air transport, although potentially much quicker, is expensive, and limited in the weight or category it can carry – it is simply not economic to move oil or iron ore by air, for example. Rail and road transport works better over short distance routes connected by land, but much of modern trade is over thousands of miles and so sea transport is usually cheaper. Ships can be adapted to carry any commodity. Exhibit 13.3 shows the types of various sea-going vessels and the weight they carry. Advances in technology, particularly in the field of refrigeration, have led to the increase in the amount of container ships in use, from a mere 10,290 tonnes in 1980 to nearly 17 times that amount 30 years later in 2010.

London has historically been the centre of the shipping world. Although the UK merchant fleet no longer dominates the seas (UK registered vessels account for less than 3 per cent of world shipping - see Exhibit 13.3), the UK has built on this history of maritime trading, and retains its place as a centre for ship trading (buying and selling second hand ships), ship chartering (agreements to carry goods between destinations) and insurance. It is also where airfreight and available aircraft capacity is matched with potential users.

# Growth of trade and shipping

Early trade and shipping on a global basis were difficult and dangerous, particularly when venturing on the routes around the southern tips of Africa or South America. Two canals made shipping distances shorter (and therefore quicker) and safer – see Exhibit 13.4. The Suez canal was opened in 1869 and linked the Mediterranean area to east Africa and the near and far east, drastically cutting journey time and expense. The Panama canal opened in 1914, cutting nearly two thirds off the route from one side of America to the other.

Exhibit 13.4 The Suez and Panama canals

As trade increased, ships became ever larger. There are ships today (supertankers) as large as 550,000 tonnes. These have outgrown both the Suez or Panama canals, and are often unable to dock at any port, having to be loaded or unloaded at sea. Having said that, the majority of vessels in use are designed specifically to be able to traverse the canals; they are bulk carriers, transporting unpackaged goods such as wheat, coal or iron ore, oil tankers supplying the world's ever-increasing need for oil and container ships carrying thousands of different items from computers to toys.

# The Baltic Exchange

Shipping companies developed in seventeenth century Europe, particularly in Holland (helped by the Dutch East India Company and other traders) and the UK (helped by the Hudson Bay Company, still in existence today but now a Canadian company, and the East India Company). UK shipping deals would be agreed in the coffee houses of London, where merchants and sea captains would gather.

The Virginia and Baltick coffee house, named after the two most widely used maritime trade routes, was the original home of the Baltic Exchange. It was a meeting place for merchants and shipowners. In 1823 it became a regulated market for ship and freight, owned and operated by a group of members who were subject to strict admission procedures to ensure probity. Today the Baltic

Exchange is a private (i.e. unlisted) limited company acting on behalf of its 550 plus members to encourage free-flowing trade by coordinating the activities of shipowners, shipbrokers and ship charterers. Its members organise the global chartering of ships for the transport of bulk raw materials to manufacturers, the buying and selling of merchant ships and the resolving of disputes.

Of the 550 members, some are chartering agents representing merchants who need to find a ship to move their cargoes. Owner brokers represent the shipowners. Some of the members are the merchants and shipowners themselves. Where they go after they have delivered their current cargo is decided at the Baltic, with dealings done largely via computers and telephones. To a remarkable extent, ship chartering is a last minute business because no one can be absolutely sure that the ship will not be delayed on its current voyage through, say, bad weather. Thus as a ship approaches its current destination back in London the Baltic brokers will be trying to carry out orders sent by owners based in say Rio or Accra to secure its next journey, going from the port that it will arrive at in a few days. They will contact brokers at the Baltic Exchange who represent clients needing to shift goods from that port. About one-third to one-half of all world ship chartering goes through the Baltic Exchange.2 It also handles one-half of the international trade of second hand vessels. Other leading ship broking centres include New York, Oslo, Hamburg, Rotterdam, Paris and Brussels, but the deals here tend to be focused on national shipping rather than international.

# Baltic indices

Industries and traders worldwide take a great interest in the information on freight and shipping rates (cost of transporting from port A to port B) which is published and updated daily by the Baltic Exchange. In 1985 the Baltic Freight Index (BFI) was launched, giving an assessment, based on information from ship brokers worldwide, of the cost of freight transport. The initial index combined information on 13 trade routes – see Exhibit 13.5. Now there are four main indices produced from more than 40 daily route assessments, the Baltic Exchange Capsize Index (BCI); the Baltic Exchange Panamax Index (BPI); the Baltic Exchange Supramax Index (BSI); and the Baltic Exchange Handysize Index (BHSI). The important Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI) replaced the BFI in 2001. It is calculated by taking information from raw materials transported via 20 key shipping routes on the other four indices and summarising it. The BDI is closely watched, as the cost of transporting raw commodities to manufacturers provides an important indication of global economic activity. A rise indicates increased demand for shipping, thus hinting at broader economic growth. A rise in cargo rates results in margin and profit increases for the shipping industry. Falls, which can be dramatic (75 per cent or more in a matter of weeks) can be devastating for shipowners.

# Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs)

At the same time as the BFI was set up, trading in derivatives of future freight rates was instigated, where standard contracts could be bought or sold. The most common type of trade is Forward Freight Agreements. FFAs allow shipowners, charterers and traders to protect themselves against the inherent volatility of freight rates by taking an offsetting position in a forward contract, the price of which is based on a freight index. FFAs give the contract owner the right to buy or sell the price of freight for transport starting at future dates. They are based on one of the Baltic indices composed of a shipping route for tankers or an index comprising a basket of routes for dry bulk contracts. (Forwards and futures are discussed in Chapter 10.)

For example, on 1 April a shipowner charters out his 75,000 deadweight tonnage, dwt, Panamax ship in the spot market on a 91-day contract at 20,000 per day. He thinks that freight rates will drop in the near future and wants to lock in the rate at which he can charter out his ship after the current contract expires.

To do this he sells a 60-day Panamax forward contract for \$18,000 per day dated for 1 July. On 1 July the ship owner receives back his ship and then contracts it for freight for 60 days for \$17,000 per day – the prevailing rate. He has less income from the freight contract than he expected (because forward rates for July to September shipping quoted back in April indicated \$18,000 per day). However, he can now close his FFA position by buying back a 60-day Panamax forward contract for \$17,000.

Sold FFA \$18,000 × 60 days \$1,080,000

Bought FFA \$17,000 \times 60 days \$ 1,020,000

Gain on the future position 60,000

This offsets the decreased income on the underlying freight deal.

All traders have to be registered with a clearing house and trades are marked to market daily, i.e. any deficit occurring has to be deposited by the trader, reducing the exposure to risk. FFAs are OTC contracts made between two parties. Freight rates are volatile, as can be seen from Exhibit 13.6 which shows BDI trading figures from 1993 to 2009. The cost of hiring a ship fell to a tenth of previous levels in the recession of 2008-2009.

# Marine insurance

Marine insurance began in London hundreds of years ago, when groups of merchants would underwrite a particular cargo against loss or damage. Lloyd's of London, described in Chapter 4, is one of the leading marine insurers. Ships' hulls and cargoes are insured. In addition shipowners take out third-party liability against a variety of risks. Allied to marine insurance are the group of legal firms specialising in marine law. These firms need to be able to offer advice in many countries of the world, and in differing legal jurisdictions.

# Lloyd's Register

Edward Lloyd, the founder of the Lloyd's of London insurance company, was also responsible for a comprehensive list of shipping. Beginning in 1764, and still very much in existence, the Lloyd's Register lists all merchant vessels in the world, giving a detailed list of information on the ships themselves and related information - see Exhibit 13.7. Lloyd's Register involves classification of ships, setting standards for the quality and reliability in their design, building and operating. The Register is an independent body, and carries out inspections for various countries and offers advice to shipping participants about risks associated with specific ships. It also provides independent safety, integrity and operational performance assessments in other transport sectors and in energy production industries. For example, it provides quality assurance and certification for offshore structures and installations such as power stations and railway infrastructure.

The Register also publishes lists of shipowners, shipbuilders, casualties, wrecks, off-shore units and a host of other information relating to shipping.

# Shipping finance

Shipping finance involves enormous sums of money lent by banks to owners, secured on the ship itself, and, if the ship has a secured time charter (i.e. is chartered for a specific length of time), sometimes secured on the charter. Most financing, no matter where the ship was built or registered, or the owners are domiciled, is usually carried out in US dollars, which became the international currency of choice for most of the world after the Second World War. The main providers of finance for the shipping industry include international commercial banks, investment banks and smaller boutique banks, which act as arrangers or introducers of capital. At any one time global bank lending for ship finance is generally between  \$300 billion and\$ 400 billion outstanding. The leading lenders are German and Norwegian banks, each with about 30 per cent market shares, followed by UK banks with 13 per cent.

Things have changed from the time when each seafaring country had its own merchant navy. Shipping has developed into an international industry, with many ships registered under flags of convenience, i.e. registered in countries where restrictions are lax regarding the nationality of the owners and crews. So a Korean-built Panamanian-registered ship owned by a Norwegian shipping company and crewed by Filipinos could be financed through the London office of an American bank. Many financing deals are carried out in London regardless of where the ship or its owners are based. Because of its concentration of expertise in terms of legal, arbitration, insurance, ship broking, financing and shipping derivatives London remains the major shipping centre of the world. English law has become the favoured choice for shipping contracts.

## Commodities

Commodities are physical goods which can be stored (i.e they are not immediately perishable), can be accurately measured and are generally fungible (they are interchangeable), thus one tonne of sugar is very much like another tonne of sugar (of the same grade). They can be soft (affected by the climate) or hard such as copper or silver.

Prices of commodities are generally fixed by supply and demand, and can change dramatically, especially the soft commodities which are affected by weather conditions. If the corn or coffee bean harvests are poor, supply will be lowered, resulting in a high price worldwide. If there is an oversupply due to an exceptionally good harvest, then the opposite happens, and the price of corn or coffee will fall – see Exhibits 13.8 and 13.9.

Large companies relying on their supplies of raw products will hedge the cost of their supplies by taking out forward, futures or option contracts as we see in the case of Mexico in Exhibit 13.8 (derivatives are discussed in Chapters 10 and 11). These contracts enable companies to even out the cost of their supplies.

# Commodity exchanges

Commodities are traded in various ways. For some, like furs and tea, the buyers need to be able to observe the quality of the produce and so these are traded through auctions after the potential buyers have conducted an examination. Others, such as nuts, fibres and spices are traded in sale rooms face to face, often through agents representing the buyers or sellers. However, many com

# Mexico hedges against corn inflation

FT

By Javier Blas in London

Mexico has taken the unusual step of insuring itself against the effect of rising corn prices on tortilla, a food staple for millions in the country, in the latest sign of growing concern about food inflation in emerging countries.

Rising food inflation has become a big headache in countries from Mexico to China and India as bad weather has ruined crops, forcing prices up.

Food accounts for up to half of all household spending in emerging countries, compared to just 10 to 15 per cent in Europe and the US.

The move by Mexico, disclosed by its economic minister, came as the quoted price of corn in Chicago hit a two-year high on the back of a smaller-than-expected harvest in the US, which accounts for more than half of the world's exports.

Bruno Ferrari told local media on Wednesday the government had bought futures contracts to fix the cost of corn. "The prices are guaranteed," he said. "The supply is also guaranteed … until the third quarter of the next year." A government official confirmed his comments.

Mexican tortilla makers threatened last week to raise prices by 50 per cent to offset the impact of higher corn and natural gas costs. That has prompted fears of a repeat of the tortilla riots of 2007, when protesters demonstrated against rising food prices.

Richard Feltes, grain analyst at brokerage R.J. O'Brien, said it was the first time he could recall a country had disclosed it was buying futures.

"There had been rumours in the past about other countries, including China, but it has never been confirmed," he said.

Traders expect corn and other agricultural commodities to surge higher in early 2011 due to low inventories and concerns about the size of the crop in Latin America. Brazil and Argentina, which produce the bulk of the southern hemisphere's exportable surplus of food, have had little rain.

Corn prices rose on Wednesday to  $6.08^{3} / 4$  a bushel, up 46 per cent from January and the highest level since mid-2008. The US Department of Agriculture has warned the country's corn stocks will fall to their lowest in 15 years by the middle of next year.

"There is a better than 50-50 chance that the corn market will take out the all-time high of 7.65 a bushel set in June 2008," Mr Feltes said.

# Sugar prices soar to 30-year high

The price of sugar has jumped to a 30-year high as the Brazilian harvest has tailed off sharply, hardening expectations of a shortage.

Traders believe that prices could soar over the coming months as the market faces a supply shortfall driven by smaller-than-forecast crops in important growing countries from Brazil to Russia and western Europe.

At the same time, inventories are at their lowest levels in decades. "All buyers we see are buying on a hand-to-mouth basis," said Peter de Klerk of Czarnikow, the London sugar merchant.

That has pushed prices up sharply, with raw sugar futures in New York soaring 135 per cent from a low of 13 cents in May.

On Tuesday ICE March sugar rose 4 per cent to a peak of 30.64 cents a pound, surpassing the level reached in February and rising to their highest point since 1980, when prices jumped to nearly 45 cents.

The dramatic rise in sugar prices is causing headaches for policymakers. While sugar is widely available in the west and its price is rarely considered, it is an essential source of cheap calories in emerging economies, where surging sugar prices are driving food inflation.

On Tuesday India's central bank raised benchmark interest rates for the sixth time this year in an attempt to curb inflation.

New Delhi has emerged as a crucial factor in the sugar market, as India's harvest is expected to be large, but the government is still debating how much sugar to allow the country's industry to export. Traders expect India to authorise exports of  $1\mathrm{m} - 2\mathrm{m}$  tonnes starting in December. Anything less, or even a delay to the decision, could send prices spiralling higher, traders warn.

"They need to start selling additional volumes by mid-December, otherwise the hole in the market is getting wider," said Mr de Klerk.

The latest move up in prices was triggered by a spell of dry weather in Brazil, which dominates the global sugar trade with about half of world exports.

Unica, the country's cane industry association, said last week that production was down 30 per cent in the first half of October from 2009, while Kingsman, a consultancy in Lausanne, has downgraded its forecast for the Brazilian crop by 2.3 per cent. "If Brazil is going to have a lower harvest it makes it that much harder to fill the deficit," said Jonathan Kingsman.

modities can be of a standardised quality, e.g. tin or lead of a specific grade and purity, and so can be traded without visual inspection because the exchange itself specifies and enforces the quality.

The first formal exchange was the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), which began trading standardised contracts in 1865 in grain futures. Chicago was at the centre of the railroad expansion, and was therefore the ideal place for grain to be delivered, traded and distributed. To help farmers and their customers, standards were set for the weight and quality of the grain, which was stored centrally. Farmers and traders began to commit to selling and buying in the future. A farmer might agree to sell a set quantity of grain for a set price at a future date. However, this could lead to some degree of regret for either the future buyer or seller at the future date, depending on the market price then. But at least each side can create some certainty – see Exhibit 13.10 for an example.

As contracts became more commonly used, the derivative contract became a tradable instrument. Traders who thought that a bushel would fall in price might sell a contract for the same number of bushels. They could then later buy a contract even if they had no gain to close the position. Conversely if they thought the price would rise, they would buy a future, hold on to the contract and sell the derivative at a later date. A profit can be taken by buying and selling a derivative without ever receiving the underlying commodity. This type of trading became commonplace, and created the high liquidity we see in commodity derivatives. Now over 95 per cent of commodity trading is in the derivative market, and most of the contracts to take delivery of a commodity are never actually executed, being off-set before delivery is due. There is no limit to the number of contracts on offer. There may be 15,000 tonnes of tin actually on the market, but there may well be 400,000 plus tonnes of tin derivatives. Buyers of contracts are said to be taking a long position; sellers are said to be going short.

# Standardisation

The essence of commodity trading is standardisation; sellers, producers and traders must be able to rely on the amount and quality of what is traded without having to undertake a physical inspection. Tight regulations govern modern commodity trading, and each commodity must comply with exact specifications. CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) is now part of the CME Group (originally Chicago Mercantile Exchange) the largest commodity trading centre in the world. The other main exchanges for commodity trading are NYSE Liffe, the leading soft commodities exchange in Europe, ICE Futures (US and Europe) part of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and commodity Exchange (COMEX) both now part of the CME Group, the London Metal Exchange (LME), the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Exhibit 13.11 gives a list (by no means exhaustive) of commonly traded commodities and the quantities in which they are traded. Additionally there will be specific standards that the commodities will have to meet.

# The London Metal Exchange (LME)

The LME, located in the heart of the City, trades hard commodities in 'rings' between 11.40 am and  $5.00\mathrm{pm}$  - it deals in non-ferrous metals plus plastic. Each commodity is allocated a five-minute ring session in turn. Thus, steel is traded between 11.40 am and 11.45 am, aluminium alloy is next at 11.45 am to 11.50. It offers futures and options in these for delivery in only a matter of days or up to 27 months hence (aluminium is exceptional with 123 months ahead contracts available).

Dealers sit in an assigned seat in a circle and bid verbally for a trade – an open 'outcry' system. There are currently 12 ring dealing members and all business which is required to be dealt 'across the floor' must be passed through one of these members. The ring system concentrates liquidity which ensures both transparency of pricing, and more representative prices than may be obtained through the other means of trading LME has. The ring sessions set official prices for non-ferrous metals and steel.

While the ring offers the greatest liquidity it suffers from the drawback that it is available for only a part of the 24-hour working day. To partially fill this gap the LME also trades through a computer system called LMEselect, which operates between 01:00 and 19:00 (London Time). On top of that it offers 24-hour telephone trading, called inter-office trading. Potential traders can see an indicative price on a screen. If they like the price they can contact a broker and then complete a deal there and then. The price actually offered by the broker in a telephone call will not necessarily be identical to the indicative prices – much depends on the size of the deal, the state of the market, and the client's credit standing and relationship with the broker.

All LME prices are quoted in US dollars, but the LME permits contracts in sterling, Japanese yen and euros and provides official exchange rates from US Dollars for each of them. Because of the high level of activity on this market – it trades around 30 billion of contract per day – the prices 'discovered' at the LME are recognised and relied upon by industry throughout the world.

Members of the exchange are required to deliver physical metal on the date specified in the contract unless the contract has been 'squared' by a buyer later selling an identical contract. Most trades are neutralised by both a buy position and a sell position, and no physical delivery is necessary. To obtain physical delivery the buyer will need to present a warrant at one of LME's registered warehouses. There are more than 600 of these located in the US, Europe and Asia. All contracts are cleared through LCH-Clearnet, which acts as a central counterparty to all contracts.

# Commodity indices

Commodity indices are another way to trade in commodities. A commodity index is nominally made up of a group of commodities linked together to form a theoretical basket of futures contracts. The Dow Jones, founder of the earliest stock index and now 90 per cent owned by the CME, calculates 23 commodity indices based on 19 commodities (aluminium, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gold, heating oil, lean hogs, live cattle, natural gas, nickel, silver, soybean oil, soybeans, sugar, unleaded gasoline, wheat and zinc), with a bewildering variety of sub-indices based on an individual commodity and different future delivery dates. The formation and calculation of the indices is far from easy. How many commodities to include? What happens when a future expires? What weights to attach to each commodity? These are difficult judgements - see Exhibit 13.16.

# By David Ricketts

Investing via indices is one of the most common routes investors take to gain access to commodities. But understanding how commodities indices work in practice, and the subtle differences that exist between them, may not be so straightforward.

Even defining what constitutes "the market" can be a significant challenge for commodities indices and that can ultimately lead to variations between different providers, says Simon Fox, an investment consultant at Mercer.

"The concept of a market index in commodities does not exist in the same way it does with equities and bonds," says Mr Fox.

"Even the well-known commodities indices are really just commodity trading strategies.

# Exhibit 13.16 continued

Indices also have to explain why their particular mix of underlying commodities represents the market and they all reach different conclusions."

Commodities indices are made up of a basket of futures contracts across various commodity sectors, although variations in the weightings to each sector from one index to another will have an impact on an investor's overall exposure.

The most popular commodity index is the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), which currently has about 75bn tracking it and has its largest weighting in energy - about 70 per cent. The S&P GCSI Light Index has an energy weighting at about half this figure.

Other commodities indices vary in their allocations to energy. The Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index, the second most popular commodity index, has a weighting to energy of 33 per cent (Dow Jones UBS places a cap on any sector weighting at 33 per cent), while the Rogers index has an energy weighting of 45 per cent.

Most of the main indices re-weight their allocations to sectors on an annual basis, although Thomson Reuters/Jefferies Commodities Research Bureau Index does this on a monthly basis.

The number of underlying commodities is also a differentiating factor between the indices on offer, and investors can expect wide variations in returns, and the diversification benefits, from each as a result.

The Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodities Indices has six underlying commodities, for example, while the Thomson Reuters/

Jefferies Commodities Research Bureau Index has 19.

Meanwhile, the Rogers index has the largest range with 36 underlying commodities, including lumber, azuki beans, wool, rubber and silk.

But it is the use of futures that imposes one of the main constraints on investors, mainly the inability of being fully able to benefit from underlying market movements, or spot returns.

"Some of the commodities indices have come under criticism because investors believed they would get exposure to spot prices, but the indices do not track these," says Dimitris Melas, executive director of research at MSCI.

"If an investor saw the price of oil double and assumed the index in which they invested with would also double, they would be very disappointed."

To enable investors to gain exposure to commodities via equities, MSCI launched its Commodity Producers Indices in 2008. Mr Melas says these are essentially equity indices that allow investors to access sectors and companies active in the commodities space, such as energy or agricultural organisations.

Another feature of commodities indices is the process of "rolling" futures contracts. When they expire, and where exactly along the yield curve new futures contracts are purchased, can also have an impact on returns.

"Depending on the shape of the curve, it [the return] can be positive or negative," says Bharat Manium, managing director, commodity investor structuring at Barclays Capital.

"What you are doing is buying one asset and selling another asset. If the price at which you buy and sell are the same, you have no returns from that process. If the price at which you are buying is higher than the one you are selling, then you will have a negative return."

Mercer's Mr Fox says "rolling" futures can leave investors exposed to other potential drags on investment performance.

He says: "Where indices are highly transparent and they have a lot of money following them, there is a risk that other market participants can take advantage of that, for example over the rolling of the contract. This can erode the returns for investors."

Others believe investors gaining exposure to commodities via indices should consider whether banks or independent organisations are in control of them.

"In many cases it can make sense for commodities indices to be offered by independent organisations, as you do not have the potential conflict of interest having a trading desk alongside those who are calculating the index," says Mr Melas.

It is a claim, unsurprisingly, that banks are reluctant to support.

"From our perspective, the group that publishes and calculates indices is separate from sales and trading," says Barclays Capital's Mr Manium.

"They are also active not only in commodities indices, but in all the asset classes. Over 1,000 different commodity indices are published daily by this team."

Many companies round the world operate commodity indices. The S&P GSCI commodity index consists of 24 commodities - see Exhibit 13.17. The weights in the index for each commodity are shown.

# Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

In addition to trading directly in a commodity it is possible to buy tradable shares in exchange traded funds which then hold either the commodity or a derivative of it. Then the ETF investors can benefit from a rise in the underlying commodity through selling ETF shares at a later date without the hassle of dealing in the commodity itself. Alternatively, the hedger or speculator can

ETFs were explained in Chapter 4, so we will not go into much detail here. Most are invested in derivatives of commodities rather than holding tonnes of zinc or barrels of oil, etc. However, there are some new ETFs on the market that hold actual physical commodities. Precious metal ETFs have been popular, and there are now funds trading in other metals, and actually holding the metal in a warehouse – see Exhibit 13.18.

# Buying the metal, not just the contracts

# Jack Farchy

Commodity investment is getting physical. A host of companies are working on products that give investors physical exposure to copper, aluminium and other base metals, spurred on by the success of similar investment vehicles in precious metal markets.

The new products - exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold physical metal - are set to open the markets to mainstream investors for the first time. But, if successful, they could also revolutionise the fundamental drivers of the markets by allowing investors to hoard metal. "There is no question that

ETFs will create a new category of physical demand for the market," says Mike Frawley, global head of metals at Newedge, a brokerage.

The building momentum behind the launch of the new products comes as base metals prices have risen sharply from the depths of the financial crisis, buoyed by resurgent demand from China and other emerging economies.

For metals such as copper and tin, with demand already outstripping supply, a fresh source of demand from investors could send prices soaring from current record levels.

Bankers say the drive for physical base metal ETFs comes from investors seeking exposure to a "hard asset" amid ever-increasing concerns about the debasement of paper currencies. Equally, and especially in the US, the products are being requested by equity fund managers, who have limited ability to gain exposure to base metals via the US equities markets.

The first movers are JPMorgan and BlackRock iShares, which have separately begun the process of launching physical copper ETFs in the US. Elsewhere, ETF Securities, a London-based ETF specialist, has

# Exhibit 13.18 continued announced its intention to launch ETFs in all the base metals traded on the London Stock Exchange. And Credit Suisse and Glencore, the world's largest commodity trading house, have applied to launch a physical aluminium investment product in Switzerland.

The main drawback from an investor's point of view is likely to be relatively high costs. Jean Bourlot, head of commodities at UBS, says: "Storage and insurance costs for base metals – aluminium in particular – are much higher than precious metals, which may be seen as a deterrent."

Neither JPMorgan nor BlackRock has provided details of the costs for their proposed copper ETFs, but bankers say they are aiming significantly to undershoot the annual fees traditionally charged by hedge fund managers - 2 per cent a year plus 20 per cent of profits. Specialists believe that with annual charges of about 1.5 per cent, the ETFs could gain traction among investors.

On the flip side, what may be expensive for investors is likely to be a boon for banks and brokers. JPMorgan, through its Henry Bath subsidiary, will reap handsome warehousing fees and Goldman Sachs, through its Metro subsidiary, is to provide the warehousing service for the BlackRock product. Moreover, dealers will have a new opportunity to arbitrage between the market price of metal and the price of the ETF shares.

# Speculative bubbles

Commodities are prone to speculative bubbles, often stimulated by a perceived shortage or surplus, or by being in fashion or going out of fashion. One of the most spectacular bubbles happened in seventeenth-century Holland and involved tulip bulbs.

Tulips were brought over to Europe from Turkey at the end of the sixteenth century and became very popular in Holland with a resulting increase in price. Propagating tulips was widespread and certain rarer varieties with attractive markings on their petals commanded high prices. As the tulip fad expanded and almost everyone in Holland decided they had to have a tulip bulb, demand increased and prices rose ever higher. Tulips were physically sold when they could be lifted from the ground, between June and September. After that, they needed to be planted to grow and flower in April.

The spot market for tulips took place when the bulbs were available for sale; at other times of the year, a futures market developed, where people would agree to pay a certain price for a tulip bulb when it became available; this contract to buy a bulb could be traded and traders made and lost vast sums of money trading in tulip bulb futures.

Such was the craze for tulips that people were paying the equivalent of thousands of pounds for a single bulb and using all their money and savings, and many ordinary people and traders made considerable profits out of trading bulbs. It seemed that tulipmania could go on for ever and the price of tulip bulbs would continue to increase.

However, the mania could not continue. At some point in 1637 the bottom fell out of the tulip market. It is thought that either a buyer failed to complete a purchase, or some prudent people decided to sell their bulbs. Panic set in. All of a sudden people who had paid large sums of money for bulbs found themselves in possession of bulbs worth one-hundredth of their purchase price; contracts were worthless and many people lost fortunes.

While more recent bubbles have not been quite as extreme as tulipmania, it is very easy for a commodity to become disproportionately popular for no good reason only for its value to fall back leaving participants in the bubble licking their wounds – see Exhibit 13.19 for a discussion about the possibility of a commodity bubble.

# Agricultural commodities

Agricultural commodities include a variety of raw unprocessed food stuffs which are transported in bulk. There are strict guidelines and standards for each commodity, and these can be very complex. For example, in Australia, for wheat alone there are thirty different standards, and they all have to comply with a long list of quality requirements. Exhibit 13.20 lists the quality parameters for one of these varieties of wheat, APH1 (Australian Prime Hard 1). Other types of agricultural commodities are subject to similar quality parameters, and domestic government bodies carry out regular and thorough checks to ensure the parameters are kept.

Talk to anyone in the know about commodities and it will not take long for the conversation to shift to one of how the sector is in the throes of a "supercycle".

Perhaps five years ago - before the credit crisis took hold - they might have talked with more exuberance as to how commodity prices were set to remain high for an extended period of time because of factors such as China's insatiable appetite for raw materials, but today the chatter is still fervent.

And there appears to be good reason. The price of gold and copper has hit record levels this year, the share price of BHP Billiton, the world's biggest mining company, has topped all-time highs, while the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index last month rose to a two-year record above 300 points.

"I believe the supercycle argument remains intact," says Simon James, funding partner of Gore Browne Investment Management who believes both emerging and developed economies have big plans to invest in their infrastructure.

George Cheveley, co-portfolio manager of Investec's Enhanced Natural Resources fund, adds: "With emerging markets, led by China, in the midst of the commodity-intensive phase of their economic growth and the western world needing to repair and renew infrastructure, we expect demand growth for commodities to substantially exceed the rates seen in the 20 years from 1974-1994 and remain strong for at least another 10."

Figures from Barclays Capital show that between 2000 and 2009, China, Brazil, India and the Middle East's share of global coal demand grew from 36 per cent to 55 per cent, while their combined demand for soyabean rose from 33 per cent to 44 per cent.

China's share of global copper demand (38 per cent), meanwhile, is now almost twice that of the US.

Obviously, the supercycle argument lost ground in 2008, when commodity prices fell sharply back to earth after considerable increases, but that has not halted investors' interest in the asset class.

Amrita Sen, a commodities analyst at Barclays Capital, says there has been "unprecedented" interest in commodity investments over the past couple of years. Investor funds, she says, "have flowed into commodities at the fastest-ever rates as the sector has moved to the top of the list of investors' favoured alternative investment exposures".

Pension funds have been particularly interested buyers, although the signs are they are not as fixated as they once were. The 130bn retirement fund for Canada's Quebec region, Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, for example, closed its commodities portfolio entirely at the start of the year, while a June survey conducted by sister FT publication NRPN of 23 Nordic pension funds found almost a quarter intended to reduce their exposure to commodities before the end of this year.

Statistics from the UK's National Association of Pension Funds paints a similar picture. In 2007, figures showed 4 per cent of schemes invested in commodities, rising to 8 per cent in 2008. Last year, however, that fell back to 5 per cent.

The fear is that perhaps commodity prices are reaching bubble territory and that investor demand could be a contributory factor.

"To me … [this] is not what long-term investors look for," Roland Lescure, chief investment officer for the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Quebec, told the press as explanation of his scheme's commodities exit.

Gore Browne's Mr James recognises those fears: "The most important contributors towards the development of a bubble in commodities are in place - cheap money and a scarcity of investment opportunities," he says. "Commodities are difficult to value, but there is a distinct sense of euphoria in a number of industrial metals and agricultural crops, and in gold."

His is somewhat a lone voice, however, with many quick to counter this view. Pioneer's Peter Konigbauer, for example, who is senior portfolio manager of the firm's Commodity Alpha fund, says: "We don't see a bubble in commodity prices. Energy prices are a long way off previous levels and we still believe in fundamentally higher prices in the future. Energy demand is picking up worldwide and the outlook is bullish."

Barclays Capital's Ms Sen agrees: "Investment activity in commodities has attracted a lot of attention with a particular focus on the institutional inflows linked to commodity indices.

"Unfortunately, much of the analysis and comment is ill-founded and confusing as we do not see commodity prices as being in a bubble, nor do we see the involvement of institutional investors as being a cause of price rises."

It is very clear, she continues, that institutional and retail holdings of commodity futures are extremely small and "nowhere near big enough" to distort the relationship between prices and market fundamentals.

"Given that institutional investors rebalance portfolios to achieve a desired allocation across assets, they are generally a stabilising influence [because in order] to achieve their desired balance they tend to sell after prices have risen and buy after prices have fallen." In other words, she says, "they do exactly the reverse of what participants in a bubble do."

Bob Greer, real return product manager at Pimco, advocates Ms Sen's viewpoint. "Hedge fund money might increase volatility as it flows in and out of specific

# Exhibit 13.19 continued commodities - but not so with index money, which is more stable."

The pull of commodities for investors has been well-documented. In addition to the growth prospects, the notion is commodities are a natural hedge against event risks because they behave differently to other financial assets and often perform well in periods of rising inflation, political uncertainty and climate change - events that tend to have a negative impact on equities and bonds.

The argument is also said to hold true for the different commodity assets themselves.

"Whilst commodity prices correlate to some extent over short periods, especially when currency or demand are the most influential driver, over longer periods commodity prices do not generally correlate with each other because most have completely different supply fundamentals," says Mr Cheveley.

This, he says, means "it is not true that commodities in general are heading for bubble territory" and is "unlikely ever to be true".

To illustrate his point he cites the fact that cotton and silver prices have risen more than 60 per cent year-to-date, while US natural gas prices are down 36.5 per cent and zinc is 17 per cent lower.

"For those commodities, however, that have risen strongly this year, in all cases the rises are supported by fundamental tightness and thus it would seem at least premature, and probably just plain wrong, to say they are heading into bubble territory," he says.

# Clearing

Exchanges ensure that all reports of a trade are reconciled to make sure all parties are in agreement as to the quantity and prices transacted. There are also checks to reassure that the buyer and seller have the cash and the underlying to do the deal. In many cases the exchange subcontracts this clearing function to a specialist organisation. LCH.Clearnet, a merger between the London Clearing House and the European-based Clearnet, is one of the major global clearing houses, with offices worldwide. It operates by also assuming the counterparty risk in every deal between its members; that is it acts as the buyer to every seller, and the seller to every buyer. Members pay a margin on each deal, the amount of which is assessed according to the risk involved. If a member fails, the margin is used to fulfil their obligations. LCH.Clearnet is Europe's main commodity clearing house for OTC and exchange traded commodities, operating for, among others, the LME, NYSE Liffe and the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which trades in gold, silver and other precious metals. Some exchanges such as CME have their own clearing system.

# Carbon trading

Carbon trading is a new type of commodity trading, which trades in carbon emissions. It is a strange concept, where traders deal in an intangible substance with a non-existent delivery. It came about as a partial solution to the problem of global warming, which the majority of scientists say is caused by the amount of carbon emitted by our increasingly industrialised world. The Kyoto treaty dictated in February 2005 that a group of industrialised countries (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan and most of Europe) must reduce total greenhouse gas emissions (most importantly carbon). However, not all countries signed the treaty, notably the US, the single biggest user and emitter of carbon gases. Despite this the European Union countries have set tough targets for carbon reduction before 2020.

Carbon is traded in a 'cap-and-trade' system. With cap-and-trade, companies are set a limit to the amount of carbon that they emit. If they emit over the required amount of carbon emissions, they are encouraged to reduce them by more efficient and less energy-greedy methods of production, or if this is not possible they are able to trade carbon reduction with another company. Instead of reducing their own emissions, which could be costly and have negative effects on productivity, they are able to pay some other company in another part of the world to reduce its emissions, which the other company is able to do more cheaply and at no cost to its own production levels. Thus we have a market in carbon emission.

Carbon is traded in metric tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (carbon dioxide). More than 90 per cent of trade takes place in London. Standardised contracts are traded on exchanges, with OTC trading also prevalent. Trading in 2009 was over 120 billion, and most experts expect the figure to increase substantially in the future.

## Gold

Gold is used in a host of manufacturing processes. It is the only yellow metal and the only one that never rusts or tarnishes; it is indestructible and non-reactive. It can be alloyed with other metals to give it different properties. It has high conductivity, making it an essential component of many electrical and electronic devices. Its non-reactive behaviour makes it useful in various medical procedures.

From time immemorial gold was minted into coins, and was an easily tradable commodity, always being regarded as a store of value and a sign of wealth. In times of crisis, investment in gold is seen as a safe option because of the perceived value derived from its scarcity – see Exhibit 13.21.

# Inflation fears bring on China gold rush

FT

Leslie Hook

At Beijing's largest gold shop, the queues to buy bullion mini bars have turned into scrums as customers jostle for one of the country's hottest commodities.

The phone behind the bullion counter rings off the hook as a frantic sales clerk tries to answer buyers' questions. The electronic chart displayed behind him says it all: the price of gold is rising and

Chinese investors, worried about inflation, want in on the trend.

"We were thinking about giving our daughter Rmb10,000 (1,500) in cash for her wedding," says an elderly couple. "But then we thought gold might be better value."

Others are shopping for themselves. "I've been buying gold for about six years as an investment," says a young man in his early 30s who works for a power company. Like many gold shoppers, he is reluctant to give his name or talk about his finances, but discloses his purchase of a 100g mini bar.

For more than 50 years, the state controlled China's gold market and domestic gold prices. However, today the shiny yellow metal has re-emerged as a popular hedge against inflation. November's inflation data revealed prices had risen 5.1 per cent from a year ago, the sharpest increase since July 2008.

Low interest rates mean that returns on bank deposits are often negative in real terms, and there are few other options for storing cash. Real estate investment has been curtailed because of government fears of a bubble. Chinese stock exchanges have slumped after a crackdown on insider trading.

The lack of a viable alternative makes gold bars and products popular investment options.

According to the World Gold Council, Chinese retail demand for the precious metal jumped 70 per cent to 153.2 tonnes in the 12 months to September, compared with the same period a year ago. Demand for gold jewellery, by contrast, was up just 8 per cent in China during that same period, to 373.6 tonnes.

China's bullion toughness is having a big effect on global gold markets. China's imports jumped to 209 tonnes during the first 10 months of this year - a fivefold increase from the previous year, says the Shanghai Gold Exchange. China, already the world's largest gold miner, is now the second-largest consumer behind India.

"People don't want to put their money in a bank," explains Zhu Yan'an, a store official. "The growth in gold bar sales has been really pronounced."

At a nearby Bank of China branch, the duty manager says apologetically that he has only one gold bar left in stock "Last week an Indian buyer came and bought all of our 1oz, 2oz and 5oz bars," he explains. "I haven't been able to get any new supplies yet."

Gold-linked investment products, or "paper gold", are also multiplying. The government recently approved its first fund to invest in overseas gold-backed exchange-traded funds. Hong-Kong's bullion exchange has just announced a gold contract denominated in renminbi.

"I buy gold because it's fun," says Lu Feng, a 26-year-old paper company manager who has just spent Rmb18,500 on gold coins engraved with pandas. He proudly displays the shiny 10-coin set to friends. The friends, however, settle for silver.

The rising price seems to be fuelling the gold mania in what is, for now, a self-sustaining cycle. "The more the price goes up, the more people buy," says Liu Hui, who sells the precious metal at a shop near Beijing's silk market.

The total supply of gold in the world is estimated by the World Gold Council to be 165,000 tonnes, the total ever mined – 95 per cent of this has been mined since the California Gold Rush in the nineteenth century. The scarcity of gold is apparent when you realise that this whole total of gold would fit into a box measuring 20 cubic metres and this scarcity is what pushes up the price of gold. Unlike many commodities, more gold cannot be easily manufactured or obtained.

Gold is quoted in US $per troy ounce (equal to 31.103 grams) and is held by some nations to guarantee their paper money. The World Bank issues figures detailing gold reserves held by countries - see Exhibit 13.22. The total amount held by all countries is estimated to be 30,462.8 metric tonnes, and valued at the London price in early 2011 of\$ 1400 per troy ounce gives a total value of more than 1 trillion.

The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) is the premier global market for trading and clearing gold and silver, which is an OTC market. Gold and silver are generally traded in bars; as with all commodities, there are strict specifications for each bar, and they are all hall-marked to guarantee their purity and identify their provenance. Despite the unit of trading being a troy ounce the minimum traded for clients are generally 1,000 ounces of gold and 50,000 ounces of silver. The unit of delivery for gold is a gold bar of generally close to 400 ounces or 12.5 kilograms. The unit of delivery for silver is a silver bar with weight between 750 and 1,100 ounces, although bars between 500 and 1,250 ounces will be accepted.

Market-making members of the LBMA provide continuous two-way bid and offer quotations in gold and silver for spot and forwards. Business is generally conducted via telephone or over electronic dealing systems. For example, in making a gold price, the dealer may quote  \$1,220-1,221, where\$ 1,220 represents the bid price the dealer will pay for gold and 1,221, the offer price at which the dealer sells gold. In addition to the two-way bid and offer market available from market makers during the London trading day there are 'Fixings'. With this clients place orders with the dealing rooms of fixing members, who net all orders before communicating the net interest to their representative at the fixing. The gold or silver price is then adjusted up and down until sell and buy orders are matched, at which point the price is declared 'fixed' and all orders are

# Concluding comments

Trade, shipping and commodities for centuries have helped countries to grow and prosper. They are a vital part of life. In every country in the world, domestic goods are supplemented and sometimes supplanted by foreign imports. The financial markets and institutions assist the flow of goods and services around the world by providing finance, trading venues and ways of reducing risk. Regulation and standardisation have enabled commodities to be imported and exported with confidence. Because there are global standards for most commodities participants know exactly what they are buying or selling. Trading in commodities can be a highly speculative, risky undertaking, open to climatic, political, economic or terrorist influences, but it is vital for producers and customers that the market be available for trade and for hedging.

# Key points and concepts
- International trade consists of the import and export of goods and services using various means of transport and transfer.
- Infrastructure needed to facilitate trade: legal, accounting, financing, transportation, and risk mitigation.
- Ways of transferring payment
- Payment in advance: best for exporters, risky for importers.
- Open account trading: best for importers, risky for exporters.
- Documentary letters of credit: in return for reassurance (evidence) that all the documents needed for the goods to be exported and imported, documents showing actual shipment of the goods, official licences, etc., are present and correct, the exporter receives full payment from the importer's bank.
- Bills of exchange: drawn up by the exporter (more usually its bank) and then signed by the importer which commits it to paying a sum of money on the due date which may be immediate (a sight draft) or, say, 90 days later (a time draft). Banker's acceptances commit the signatory bank to make the future payment. A bill of lading is normally needed for documentary letters of credit, bills of exchange and banker's acceptances: a document issued by a carrier to an exporter or its bank confirming that the goods have been received by the carrier, that the carrier accepts responsibility to deliver the goods to the importer and evidence of ownership of the goods.
- Forfaiting: an exporter holding a series of promissory notes from the importer guaranteeing that it will pay amounts at, say, intervals over a number of years can sell this series of rights to a forbaiting company at a discount.
- Factoring charges a fee to collect trade debt owed to a company. The company receives immediately, say, 80 per cent of its outstanding debt from the factor, with the remainder handed over less fees when the factor receives full payment of the debt from the importer.
Insurance and guarantees
- Companies need to check out their customers.
- International shipments are generally insured because of the vulnerability of the goods to damage or complete loss.
- Export guarantee schemes: government-based agencies provide insurance against customer defaulting or if for any other reason the exporter or its bank is not paid.
- Political risk: can occur if the government of the importing country changes rules and regulations or becomes unstable or if the domestic currency is prone to excess fluctuation.
- London is a historic centre for shipping deals and many commodities.
- Shipping transactions were first formalised on an exchange in the UK in London coffee houses during the seventeenth century. The Baltic Exchange is the leading centre for ship trading (buying and selling second-hand ships) and ship chartering (agreements to carry goods between destinations). It is also where airfreight and available aircraft capacity is matched with potential users.
- The Baltic Exchange developed indices giving indications of the cost of shipping. The Baltic Exchange Dry Index, BDI, is an important indicator of the cost of shipping rates on key routes.
- Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs) allow shipowners, charterers and traders to protect themselves against the volatility of freight rates by taking an offsetting position in a forward, the price of which is based on a freight index. FFAs gives the contract owner the right to buy or sell the price of freight for transport starting at future dates. They are based on one of the Baltic indices composed of a shipping route for tankers or an index comprising a basket of routes for dry bulk contracts.
- Marine insurance is a very important market in London.
Lloyd's Register is a worldwide register of ships and shipping details.

Shipping finance is mainly carried out in dollars via London-based financial institutions. The main providers of finance for the shipping industry include international commercial banks, investment banks and smaller boutique banks, which act as arrangers or introducers of capital.

- Commodities are physical goods which can be stored (not immediately perishable), can be accurately measured and are generally fungible. They can be soft (affected by the climate) or hard, such as copper or silver.
Commodities are traded in various ways: through auctions after the potential buyers have conducted an examination; in sale rooms face to face, often through agents representing the buyers or sellers. However, many commodities can be of a standardised quality, e.g. tin or lead, and so can be traded without visual inspection because the exchange itself specifies and enforces the quality.
Over 95 per cent of commodity trading is in derivatives.
All commodities must comply with strict standards and guidelines.
- Commodity indices enable derivative trading in groups of commodities. They are very difficult to construct with intellectual consistency.
- London is the centre for metal trading. The London Metal Exchange, LME, oversees trading of nonferrous metals in a ring, by computer and by telephone. It has 600 licensed warehouses around the world to take physical delivery. Most trades are neutralised by both a buy position and a sell position.
ETFs are funds trading in baskets of commodities. Investors can buy shares in ETFs to gain exposure to commodity price moves. ETFs that invest in commodities are often termed exchange-traded commodities, ETCs.
Commodities can be prone to speculative bubbles.
- Agricultural commodities are raw unprocessed foodstuffs which must comply with strict standards.
- Carbon trading is trading in carbon dioxide emissions.
The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) is the premier global market for trading and clearing gold and silver, which is an over-the-counter (OTC) market.
