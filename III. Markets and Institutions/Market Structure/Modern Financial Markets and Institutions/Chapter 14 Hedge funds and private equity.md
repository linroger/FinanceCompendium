# Hedge funds and private equity

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this chapter, the reader should have a clear understanding of hedge funds and private equity and be able to: explain what hedge funds are and who are the participants;

explain the different types of hedge fund; describe the fee structure of hedge funds;

discuss the strategies used by hedge funds; explain the function of prime brokers;

describe private equity and how it is carried out; understand the function of business angels;

distinguish the different types of private equity; explain exit strategies.

Hedge funds and private equity – what comes into your head when you see those words? Here are some words people often associate with them – greed, excess, vultures, asset strippers. These opinions are not helped by the eye-catching headlines about the huge amounts made by some of these funds. John Paulson, whose fund made \$4 billion in 2007 betting against the US housing market, is reported to have made \$5 billion in 2010.

Both hedge funds and private equity aim to spot financial situations where there is a market inefficiency (irrational pricing) and use investment to gain advantage. Where they see things out of balance, hedge funds have the freedom to invest where normal investment managers cannot, notably by using short selling. Private equity comes to the rescue of many companies who would otherwise be unable to make progress through lack of funding. In both cases the motivation is not altruistic; hedge funds and private equity exist to make profit for investors.

Over the past 30 years, there has been a huge growth in the amount of investment in hedge funds and private equity. Private investors and investment institutions (e.g. pension funds) seeking a profitable home for their funds have found that these two types of investment can offer good rates of returns. However, there are worries about the lack of information concerning the use to which their money is put. There are also worries that these types of funds can be very illiquid investments unsuitable for many investors (their money can be locked-in for months or years), and that besides investment risk clients can have undue exposure to risks such as fraud. The industry is in a state of flux at the moment, with the EU and the US attempting to bring in new regulations designed to promote greater transparency, liquidity and safeguards for investors - see Exhibit 14.1.

# Exhibit 14.1

# Industry mulls over alternatives directive

In the past few weeks hedge fund groups and private equity companies have been digesting tough new Pan-European regulations from last month's long-awaited directive for the alternative asset management industry.

After more than 18 months of wrangling over the text between European Union officials and the industry, some of the more severe restrictions have been softened, but just how workable is the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive?

"It is a lot better than the original [document]. What initially looked like a death sentence [for the industry] has not happened," says Andrew Baker, chief executive of Aima, the hedge fund association.

But Aima would not have voted in favour of the directive had it had the opportunity to do so, he adds.

Simon Horner, public affairs manager at the British Private

Equity and Venture Capital Association, agrees. While he believes "on balance the directive is viable", it is nevertheless "a compromise and not ideal".

Much will depend on the next stage when the detail of the framework will be fleshed out by the European Commission and Esma, the European securities and markets regulator, which opens its door to business in January.

"The devil will be in the detail. We are not out of the deep water yet," says Jarkko Syyrila, deputy director general at Efama, the European asset management body.

Although Brussels has opted for a lighter touch than initially envisaged some sticking points remain. One of the biggest concerns is how the regulation will affect depositories, the safe-keepers of funds' assets. First-draft proposals to make depositories, such as banks, liable for all asset losses were regarded as draconian but have since been softened.

The issue of liability and compensation for lost assets came into the spotlight two years ago when investors saw their money disappear from funds of hedge funds invested in the Ponzi scam run by US fraudster Bernard Madoff.

Although the new regime aims to target hedge fund groups and private equity companies - in part regarded by some as having contributed to the financial crisis - other types of companies such as investment trusts are also caught in the directive's broad sweep.

New rules against asset stripping by private equity companies, through limiting the selling of assets for the first two years after an acquisition, are also causing the industry concern. The industry fears the limitation would discourage investment.

From 2013, when the directive has to be adopted into national

# Exhibit 14.1 continued laws, approved fund managers will be allowed to market their funds across the EU rather than relying on the current method of seeking approval on an individual country basis, known as private placement.

Efama believes private placement has its advantages. "We still think individual member states know what is best for their countries but private placement will go," says Mr Syyrila, referring to the plan to phase out this option.

He is concerned that the pan-European marketing rights or EU passports - which after much negotiation will be extended to managers and funds outside the region from

2015 - will be a "full passport" but also one where the "hurdle is not too high. If you put too much [regulatory] onus on managers they might walk away," he adds.

Hedge funds seek inefficiencies or discrepancies in financial market prices and take advantage of them; private equity provides financing for unquoted companies in need of it. Both provide perfectly legitimate solutions for problems, but the manner in which they do this, and the fact that their actions can precipitate events (such as a run from sub-prime mortgages or a particular currency), are the cause of major concern. However, the concern seems to be something of a moral problem. It cannot be a bad thing for inefficiencies in financial markets to be brought to public attention, or financing to be made available to companies, but is it right that huge profits should be made this way? That seems to be the crux of the criticism directed at both hedge funds and private equity.

# Hedge funds

To the man in the street, there is a certain mystique about hedge funds. What are they? What do they do? How do they make money? The first half of this chapter seeks to demystify and explain them. Probably the one detail that everyone thinks they know about hedge funds is that they make money, lots of money, and indeed some of them do - see Exhibit 14.2.

To the outside world, hedge funds often look much like investment banks on speed: far bigger bonuses, far bigger risks and far bigger profits.

The latest figures seem to confirm that prejudice. In the second half of last year, the current top 100 funds made  \$70bn for their clients, and - assuming they took only the standard 20 per cent cut - fees for themselves of about\$ 17.5bn.

The top 10 hedge funds, measured by all-time dollar returns, made profits for their investors of 28bn, equivalent to the profits of six of the largest banks. Paulson & Co, which employs about 120 people, made 5.8bn for clients in six months, more than the net income of Goldman Sachs, which employs about 32,500.

The data calculated by LCH Investments, an investor in hedge funds managed by the Edmond de Rothschild group, may help to explain why Wall Street banks fought so hard to stop the Dodd-Frank rules banning them from hedge fund activity - a battle they ultimately lost.

The exit of the banks from proprietary trading, a kind of internal hedge fund, should help to boost hedge fund returns by reducing competition, many managers and investors believe. Indeed the winding down of many prop desks last year ahead of the rules, led by Goldman, may already have supported returns.

Nagi Kawabani, chief executive of London and Geneva-based Brevan Howard, the only non-US hedge fund to make the top 10 list, says: "It's a plus because there's

200 less capital chasing the same trades we chase, but it may affect liquidity [in markets].

But he cautions that the boost may be temporary. "It is not like the banks pulling out means their guys have suddenly gone off and started to paint. They will reappear somewhere else."

Future returns, then, will come down to the success of the traditional hedge fund pitch: skill and the ability to spend more on research and technology.

The best funds on the LCH rankings are those that manage to produce good returns even after expanding. The table is dominated by managers who have become investing legends and whose moves are closely followed by would-be imitators.

George Soros, whose Quantum fund has made 35bn after fees for investors since it was set up in 1973, is ranked as the man who has done most for clients in dollar terms. He is closely followed by John Paulson who entered history books by making the most money for investors – and himself – in a single year in 2007 with his bet against subprime. After that comes Bridgewater's Pure Alpha, run by Ray Dalio, whose research is some of the most sought-after on Wall Street. The words of Seth Klarman, founder of Baupost, next on the list, are widely sought after, with copies of his out-of-print book *Margin of Safety* selling for upwards of 1,000.

In the past six months only one fund fell out of the top 10, Steven Cohen's SAC Capital, as the much larger San Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management pushed past it with strong returns, continuing its recovery from a terrible time during the credit crunch. One widely respected fund, Renaissance Technologies' Medallion, is not included as no data is available since it took the decision to reject external clients a few years ago.

But not all of the all-time top 10 did well last year. Brevan told clients recently that all three of its big ideas failed and it was basically flat on the year (an "aberration", says Mr Kawkabani).

The mass of smaller funds continued to underperform the leaders in the second half of last year. While the top 100 funds made  \$70bn on assets under management of\$ 746bn, the 7,000 or so other funds, which run more than twice as much money, only managed to make 59bn for investors.

But there are many sceptical voices when it comes to whether the average hedge fund produces a high return - see Exhibit 14.3 for an interesting discussion of hedge fund performance.

# What are hedge funds?

The origin of hedge funds goes back to 1949, when Alfred Winslow Jones, an investment manager from New York, came up with an innovative investment strategy; he took both short and long positions in shares. He sold shares he did not own by borrowing the shares (e.g. from a broker, for a fee) expecting them to fall in price so that he could buy them for less when he needed to return them to the broker and so make a profit (short position). At the same time, he bought shares he expected to rise in price (long position).

If it looks like a cow, and moos like a cow, chances are the animal could make a tasty dish - but isn't venison. Investors should take note. Hedge funds, the most expensive item on the investment menu, have been producing returns almost identical to portfolios from the cheap burger joints of the advisory business, made up of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent bonds.

No wonder hedge funds are worried. Bankers report increasing concern among these latter-day masters of the universe over how they will pay the fat bonuses their traders demand this year. Some high-profile managers have given up altogether.

"Absolute return", the ability to make money whatever the weather, is proving elusive. Hedge funds need to demonstrate to the pension funds and endowments that have become their biggest clients that they can at least earn returns that are independent of shares and bonds - the holy grail of institutional investors, who care about correlation more than returns.

Unfortunately for them, their similarity to the simple equity/bond portfolio seems to be increasing - undermining the industry even more than the insight a few years ago that hedge funds could be replicated with complex computer codes.

Furthermore, research shows that investors do far worse from hedge funds than standard measures suggest. Ilia Dichev at Emory

University in Atlanta and Gwen Yu at Harvard found that investors miss all the hedge fund outperformance by overtrading. Put simply, they buy funds that have already gone up and subsequently do less well, and sell funds that have gone down and subsequently recover. The pair conclude that actual investors in the "star" funds, which seem on paper to have the best returns, really earn 8-9 percentage points less.

Investors got another unwelcome reminder this month of the worst danger of investing in hedge funds: the risk that they cannot withdraw.

Hundreds of the largest investors in the sector were expecting final resolution of one of the most egregious uses of hedge funds' ability to restrict withdrawals.

Not surprisingly, some investors are unhappy with the situation. Hopefully they will learn the lesson: investments that make returns by investing in hard-to-sell assets are, well, hard to sell.

This links back into performance. During the boom years for hedge funds, huge numbers of funds boosted returns with private equity, over-the-counter derivatives and other hard-to-trade assets. Managers appeared smarter than they really were, because they were taking a risk they did not recognise.

Both absolute and uncorrelated returns, it turns out, are hard to earn without risk. And few managers want to take any sort of risk at the moment, leaving them making returns more similar to the markets. Leverage is close to its lowest ever, after volatile trading repeatedly outfoxed managers. Simple strategies reliant on stockpicking skill have also been hurt by high levels of correlation between stocks.

Hedge funds still hold an allure, both for investors and, thanks to their secrecy, the media.

Put together the lack of uncorrelated returns, unjustifiably high fees, the past failure of investors to pick the funds that will perform in future and the danger of not being able to get one's money back, and hedge funds sound a lot less appealing.

As one big investor in the sector puts it: "If you can't generate alternative low or non-correlated returns, there is little point in the asset class."

Better, perhaps, to conclude that there is no asset class. Some hedge funds are truly uncorrelated, reliant on lawsuits, exotic derivatives, computer programs or the brilliance of their founders for returns. Others are little more than overpriced mutual funds. Investors need to accept that not everyone can get their money into the new hedge funds able to deliver what they want. Until then, investors are paying Cipriani prices for what too frequently turns out to be a cheeseburger and fries.

If a share he expected to rise did actually rise in price he made money. If the share prices of those he had shorted did actually fall he made money on them also. Even if the entire market fell he would make money, so long as the shorted shares fell more than the long position shares. If the entire market rose he made money overall, so long as the long position shares rose more than the short position shares.

The definition of Jones' hedge fund then is a fund which aims to achieve a good absolute return, to preserve the principal for investors, whether the market rises or falls. Standard conventional investment funds tend to be long only – buying assets such as shares in the hope that prices will rise. They seek to make a relative return, relative to the performance of a particular index or market. So, if their fund decreases in value by 20 per cent they receive a pat on the back if the market index against which they are measured went down by say 22 per cent over the same period. The type of fund Jones ran, by contrast, takes a market neutral strategy, aiming to make an acceptable return regardless of whether the market fluctuates up or down.

Jones' strategy was largely unknown until 1966, when Fortune magazine published an article describing his 'hedge fund' and how it had outperformed all other funds by a huge amount, even with the performance fee of 20 per cent taken into account (Jones charged clients 20 per cent of the profit he made for them). This led to the formation of numerous hedge funds and a massive expansion in the amount of hedge fund investment, with investors enthusiastically handing over their money to participate in the exceptional returns which hedge fund managers promised and sometimes delivered. Now hedge funds have grown so large that it is thought they account for well over 50 per cent of all trading on the London Stock Exchange and other world markets. TheCityUK estimate that there are nearly 9,500 hedge funds managing assets of \$1,700 billion – see Exhibit 14.4. Another estimate, based on data from custodians and administrators, puts the figure of hedge funds assets under management at \$2,700 billion – see Exhibit 14.5. Note that lack of any central registry leads to a lack of accurate data.

# Who invests?

Most conventional fund managers are not only limited to a restricted list of investible assets but are subject to tough supervision by regulators. In comparison, hedge funds are for the most part lightly regulated and taxed, free to invest in a wide variety of markets and instruments. This freedom to range more widely than conventional funds was first fully appreciated by wealthy Americans, who, as individuals or through family trusts, placed large sums in the hands of hedge fund managers. Conventional investment funds are registered with the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which imposes risk-reducing restrictions on the fund if it is to be allowed to accept money from ordinary savers. To prevent the need for registration and

By Sam Jones

The global hedge fund industry has more then 2,700bn of assets under management according to a survey of custodians and administrators released today - a figure that would make the industry far larger than most market participants have previously estimated.

The 2,700bn estimate, calculated for a HFM Week survey, is a more accurate figure than those traditionally reported as indicative of the size of the hedge fund industry. And, unlike some other surveys, the estimates ignore any leverage in funds, keeping figures lower.

Most estimates – which put the total size of hedge fund assets under management between  \$1,700bn and\$ 2,000bn – rely on information provided by individual managers.

thus scrutiny and regulation by the SEC, small US hedge funds keep the number of investors to 99 or fewer accredited investors. Accredited investors are those who are thought wealthy enough or professional enough not to need the protection of the SEC. They are supposed to be able to largely look after themselves in the financial jungle, to have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of a hedge fund investment. As far as individual investors are concerned they are regarded as accredited investors and therefore hedge funds can accept their money if:

They have individual net worth, or joint net worth with a spouse, that exceeds  \$1 million at the time of purchase, or income exceeding\$ 200,000 in each of the two most recent years or a joint income with a spouse exceeding 300,000 for those years, and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year.

An accredited investor may also be an institution such as a bank, insurance company or small business investment company. If the accredited investor is a trust or a charity, e.g. university endowment, then its assets must exceed 5 million.[2]

Most jurisdictions around the world have similar restrictions limiting access to hedge fund investment to only the professional and wealthy. However, hedge funds in Europe have developed new products recently that allow small investors to participate under the UCITS rules – see later in the chapter.

As you can see from Exhibit 14.6 the source of a large proportion of hedge fund money is still wealthy individuals and wealthy families, often investing through their endowments and foundations. Much of this money will be channelled through fund of funds which splits the individual/family money between a number of hedge funds. Pension funds and corporations are also big contributors of money to be invested by hedge fund managers.

# Gates and lock-ups

Money invested in hedge funds is often locked up for a period (which could be two years or more) during which time the funds are not available for withdrawal by the ultimate investors. Funds may also be gated; a limit is placed on the amount that can be withdrawn from the fund at any one time. A common gate is a 25 per cent limit in any one quarter of a year. Gates and

Endowments and foundations

Fund of funds

Individuals lock-ups are devices to prevent the manager having to liquidate funds at a time when prices are not favourable for redemption, and to prevent a run on funds. For example, if the manager has invested in a number of corporate bonds currently in a distressed state (e.g. coupon payments have been missed or covenants breached) because the issuing firms are struggling, he may be justified in refusing to repay hedge fund investors on demand. To do so would mean selling the distressed bonds before the benefits of the new arrangements (e.g. additional financial support) he is making with the distressed firms have worked through to make a profit. Alternatively, the fund might have invested in very illiquid assets such as property loans that cannot be liquidated quickly to reimburse the fund's investors at short notice.

# Side pocket

A side pocket enables a fund manager to separate a difficult to value or illiquid investment from all other investments. An investor who withdraws from the fund cannot redeem any investment which has been placed in a side pocket, until and unless the fund manager decides to liquidate it. This is because of the danger of putting a false value on these assets. If an investor could ask the manager to guess at the value and receive a payout based on that, this would be unfair to the remaining investors if the guess was over-optimistic and it turned out that the value when actually sold is much less. Side pockets restrictions were used a lot in 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed. Many hedge fund assets became impossible to sell and extremely difficult to value. It would have been unfair to allow some investors to withdraw holdings in hedge funds at that point based on theoretical or historical value. Naturally, any new investor's funds do not share in existing side pockets because it is impossible to judge the proportion of the asset they own relative to older investors.

# Hedge fund registration

Mainly to reduce tax for investors, but also to lower the regulatory burden, 60 per cent of hedge funds are registered in offshore tax havens and the remainder in countries or states where regulations are not overly restrictive, such as Delaware in the US. Exhibit 14.7 shows the domicile of hedge funds for 2009. This explains part of the mystique; hedge funds are often not legally obliged to disclose their details for public consumption. Because of this lack of transparency, it is very difficult for an outsider to know the value of a hedge fund and its investments.

# Fund managers

The quality of fund managers is crucially important to the success of a hedge fund. They usually have free rein to invest in whatever they choose, and most have a substantial personal investment in their fund. While being permitted to use idiosyncratic schemes for investing, prior to raising money from investors they usually state to investors the types of strategies they will be employing, e.g. investing in shares both long and short, or investing in distressed debt.

There is much discussion about a fund manager's alpha. Alpha is the return achieved above the return expected given the risk class of investment that he engages in – the 'risk-adjusted return'. The simplified way of estimating this is to judge the managers performance by how many percentage points over the average benchmark return on an index such as the S&P 500 he has achieved. A manager who consistently produces good alpha is thought to possess good investing skill and is in great demand.

Hedge funds are managed by investment companies which will generally be onshore companies registered and regulated by their domestic laws. For example, there are many managers based on the US East Coast in towns such as New York and the Gold Coast area of Connecticut, despite the funds themselves being registered in say the British Virgin Islands. They value being close to major financial centres from which they can draw talent. This also allows them to be close to their investors. These managers, either a single manager or a management team, perform the investment and administration of the funds. Sometimes they are part of large investment companies, sometimes they are run by a single manager.

Most UK hedge funds are incorporated in places like the Cayman Islands and so outside any UK regulations; however, these funds are usually managed by UK-domiciled managers – usually with offices in Mayfair. The managers based in the UK are subject to FSA regulations.

According to TheCityUK (see Exhibit 14.8), New York is the leading centre for hedge fund managers, with 41 per cent, followed by London with 20 per cent managing three-quarters of European hedge fund investments. These two locations, with their strong pools of professionals of every calling, are ideal providers of all professional, financial and managerial services to both hedge funds and other investment entities.

In return for their efforts, managers charge annual fees, generally between 1 and 2 per cent, but this can be up to 5 per cent, of the net asset value of the fund, plus a performance or incentive fee of generally 20 per cent, although this can be as much as 50 per cent, of any profits. Commonly this is '2 and 20', that is a 2 per cent annual fee plus a 20 per cent performance fee. Taking, for example, J.P. Morgan, administering a fund of \$50.4 billion (see Exhibit 14.9), even a 1 per cent management fee would be \$504 million, plus a performance fee.

Hedge fund managers are often reported to be earning vast amounts of money and it is easy to see how this can happen. Performance fees are not paid in most other forms of investment, where it is usual to charge just an annual fee. Many other investment vehicles are banned from offering performance fees. The idea behind a performance fee is to encourage the managers to stretch themselves to make a billionnormal profits, but this can also encourage them to take undue risks, as there is no mechanism in place for them to share losses as well as profits, and even if losses are made they still earn their management fee. Occasionally there may be a clawback scheme, where fees can be claimed back in the event of underperformance in years following good years with high fees paid to managers - see Exhibit 14.10.

There are two commonly (but far from universally) used checks on performance fees:

- High water marks (loss carryforward provision) Where a fund's performance has dropped, the manager does not receive a performance fee until the fund reaches its previous position. For example, if a fund is launched with  \$1 billion which rises to\$ 1.2 billion in the first year due to good investment choices, the managers might take 20 per cent of the gain ( \$40 million) as a fee. If in the next year it drops to\$ 1.1 billion, the managers will not receive a performance fee. If in the third year the fund rises to \$1.3 billion, the performance fee applies only to the return above the previous high point (\$1.2 billion) and so only 20 per cent of \$100 million is paid rather than the full return for that year of \$1.3–1.1 billion.

Just one in 10 hedge fund managers expects to see the fees they charge investors fall in spite of recent under-performance that has seen income reduced, according to a Credit Suisse survey.

The industry suffered its heaviest outflows ever in 2008-09 but hedge funds still balk at the idea of cutting the standard "two and 20" fee structure, 2 per cent of assets and 20 per cent of returns, that they charge clients, the poll found.

But the survey, which took in responses from nearly a third of the 1,700bn global hedge fund industry, found that managers are open to negotiation.

Two-thirds of respondents said they were willing to bargain on fees if investors consented to longer lock-up periods and such deals have already begun to take place.

MSD Capital, the manager of Michael Dell's 10bn fortune, recently launched a new distressed debt fund open to outside investors that carries a three-year lock-up but with the promise that fees cannot be withdrawn from the fund for that period as well.

Theleme Partners, launched this year by Patrick Degorce, a former partner at activist fund TCI, charges a proportional management fee that decreases as assets under management increase.

For institutional investors in particular, such structures are likely to be particularly attractive.

Calpers, the largest pension fund in the world, which has more than 5.9bn allocated to hedge funds, announced a review of its hedge fund relationships last year and has been placing pressure on managers to reform the way they charge, according to the fund with which it invests.

Meanwhile in the UK, Hermes BPK, which manages hedge fund investments on behalf of the BT pension scheme, has also been pushing for change and is itself to allow its own clients to claw back the fees it charges in the event of under-performance.

Such fee negotiations are all part of a longer due diligence period in which investors research hedge funds, according to Credit Suisse.

The bank's survey also found that the average time spent by investors conducting due diligence has risen from 5.8 to 7.5 months.

While 41 per cent of funds of funds - the largest single class of hedge fund investor - previously spent three months or less conducting their due diligence, now just 9 per cent do, highlighting the particular pressure they have come under to demonstrate greater rigour in the wake of the Madoff scandal.

Hedge funds are also looking to meet the needs of investors keen for so-called managed accounts, which are segregated portfolios tailored to the specific needs of the account holder.

- *Hurdle rates* Performance fees will be triggered only once the fund has achieved a minimum annualised performance. The hurdle might be set as the yield on a government treasury bill, LIBOR or a fixed percentage, say 5 per cent per year. When the hurdle rate is surpassed the manager may either be entitled to a performance fee as a percentage of the entire annualised return or just a share of the return above the hurdle rate.

Some funds charge investors for withdrawing money from a fund (redemption fee, withdrawal fee or surrender charge). This may apply only to the first year of the investment or to a specific proportion of the investment the investor made. This is to discourage disinvestment when the fund might be engaged in illiquid or complex investing strategies.

Exhibit 14.11 gives a good description of fees.

# Hedge funds investors have a great chance to cut fees

James Macintosh

Walk around London's Mayfair or New York's Midtown at the moment and - if you can avoid tripping over unemployed bankers - you can listen in on plenty of conversations about kicking hedge funds while they are down.

This is not about punishing flashy fund managers for their worst-ever year, although there is no shortage of schadenfreude. Rather, investors are riled about fees, the famed "2 and 20" - 2 per cent a year and 20 per cent of profits - the standard hedge fund charges.

It is now commonly accepted that fees will fall, as hedge funds' demands for capital exceeds supply from investors, and market forces work their magic. In fact, fees are already falling at many funds, something Bentley dealers and yacht brokers should be watching closely.

But investors are not just worked up about hedgies creaming off too much money. They are also becoming increasingly vocal about the structure of fees.

Changes being demanded include hurdle rates, or minimum returns before performance fees are paid; clawbacks of performance fees if good years are followed by losses; greater transparency; information about who other investors are; and even the right to trade their hedge fund holdings in the secondary markets.

About time too. Hedge fund fees are outrageous, not because of their size - although sensible investors should worry about this - but because they fail to do their job properly.

One of the key differences between hedge funds and mainstream funds is that hedge fund managers are supposed to have their interests aligned with those of investors, thanks to the performance fee.

But there are four areas where the fee structure is broken. The first is the ability to make money from doing virtually nothing. Consider a  \$1bn hedge fund, charging 2+20 which made 5 per cent in 2007 - possible with risk-free government bonds. This would earn the manager a\$ 30m fee, with 20m of profits left to give to investors. The manager could sit on a beach all year and still collect his bonus.

The second problem is connected: even a very successful hedge fund may pay most of its outperformance, "alpha" in the jargon, in fees.

Calculations by actuaries Watson Wyatt show that even where a fund appears to be making money, the scale of fees it takes can be extortionate because so much of many hedge funds' returns comes from being long equities.

It considers a typical long-short equity hedge fund charging  $1.5 + 20$ , with full exposure to the market and a 30 per cent short position.

If such a fund managed to outperform by 5 percentage points on both long and short positions - a very strong performance if sustained - it would cream off 65 per cent of the "alpha", the value added by the fund, in fees.

These problems are easily fixed by imposing a hurdle rate: performance fees are not earned until the manager has exceeded a base level of profit.

The third problem is the lack of risk for hedge fund managers. If they do well, they get fat fees. If they do badly the next year, they don't have to repay anything - encouraging wild risk taking in the hope of getting rich.

Hedge funds have recognised this problem for their own staff, who are typically paid bonuses based on their own performance. Big names such as Tudor Investment Corp and Brevan Howard impose "clawbacks', holding back part of bonuses until later years and withdrawing them if money is lost.

But none has yet accepted a clawback provision for their fees. They should.

The final problem is the incentive for big funds just to produce moderate performance to hold on to assets. Annual fees are designed to finance the hedge fund manager's

# Exhibit 14.11 continued business, with performance fees paying bonuses. As funds grow, though, the annual fee becomes a big source of profit in itself, suggesting it should be lowered as assets expand.

Consider John Paulson, founder of Paulson & Co in New York. He offers a bargain in hedge fund land: fees of  $1 + 20$ , against the norm of  $2 + 20$ . But with  $\$35$ bn under management, that now gives his firm a steady income of  $\$350$ m a year, without doing anything.

Mr Paulson has, commendably, ignored such issues, making profits last year and producing eyewateringly good returns in 2007 thanks to his prediction of the subprime crisis.

Fixing these problems is difficult, because investors have different priorities, as a survey of its clients by Albourne Partners, which advises investors with  $\S 200\mathrm{bn}$  in hedge funds, showed.

Not all of the above problems apply to every fund, but with thou sands of investors clamouring for different fee structures, hedge funds have an incentive to sit tight and change nothing.

Investors should get together, work out what they want and set a new standard for funds to comply with, to ensure they take advantage of what could be a brief period of negotiating power.

Hedge funds may restrict the flow of additional money to the fund to an amount that can be sensibly managed, and even close the funds to new investors. When these vehicles grow too large, the sheer volume of funds available can make it very difficult to place investments, and the scale of operations can result in loss of flexibility in selecting investment assets.

# Fund of hedge funds

A fund of hedge funds is a fund which invests in other hedge funds, thereby spreading the risk, so if one hedge fund in the fund is doing badly, the others will compensate for this. A fund of hedge funds manager is expected to make a good, varied choice in hedge funds for investment, with the aim of producing far better than average returns. They are supposed to investigate the funds thoroughly to ensure that they are run with high integrity, efficiency and wisdom. This seems a good idea for investors, but the downside is that there are two lots of annual fees and performance fees to be paid out, usually on a 1 and 10 basis to the fund of hedge funds manager, plus 2 and 20 to the fund manager. Unfortunately, not all fund of hedge funds managers have been successful (see Exhibit 14.12); some have been too complacent.

"For Monica and Walter Noel, their hilltop retreat in Mustique is all about the mix - of family, friends, great times and a sexy global design style," declared Town & Country in 2005 about the founder of the hedge fund group, Fairfield Greenwich, his Swiss-Brazilian wife and their five photogenic daughters.

It was a fairy tale existence, in more ways then one. The Noels' millions it turns out, were largely derived from Bernie Madoff's alleged  $50bn (€36bn,$ 33bn) Ponzi scheme. The fees to investors on Fairfield's biggest hedge fund, the Madoff-managed Fairfield Sentry, produced two-thirds of Fairfield's \$250m revenues, and \$200m profits, in 2007.

Those figures, disclosed by The New York Times, illustrated just what a nice business the funds-of-funds industry had become. That profit of 200m was mostly distributed to Fairfield's 21 partners, including four of Mr Noel's son-in-law.

The Noels did not know the family business was supported by fraud but that is not exactly a justification since Fairfield, like other funds of funds and European private banks that entrusted their investors' money to Mr Madoff, were paid above all to keep it safe.

Now the funds-of-funds industry, which hardly existed two decades ago but today handles 45 percent of all hedge fund assets, has moved from hilltop retreat to dog house.

Fairfield Greenwich, which had 7.5bn invested with Mr Madoff, faces at least one class action lawsuit from enraged investors. In legal terms, it may have a defence, since a US court ruled in another case that a hedge fund advisory group was not liable for failing to spot a Ponzi scheme.

Still, Madoff-linked groups such as Farifield Greenwich, Tremont Capital and Union Bancaire Privée clearly failed to perform their lucrative jobs well enough. That rounds off a bad year for funds of funds, which have performed even worse than hedge funds and now look ridiculous.

Warren Buffett always thought they did. The Sage of Omaha has a thing against "helpers", such as hedge funds, that take investors' money in fees while performing not much better than a low-cost index fund.

That applies especially to funds of funds, which exist to carry out due diligence for investors who do not have the time or resources to do it themselves, and put their money in a selection of hedge funds. For that, they charge 1 per cent plus 10 per cent of any investment profits.

Mr Buffett thinks this is money for old rope, a view it is hard to dispute in the case of the Madoff brokers. He has made a 1m bet with Protégé Partners, a New York fund manager, that an S&P 500 index fund will outperform five funds of funds, after fees, over 10 years.

Fraud aside, there are problems with the investment pitch that funds of funds make. Many sold the idea that they had access to the best hedge fund managers, who had closed funds to new investors.

Whatever the truth of that in the past, the industry cannot afford to be stand-offish now. "The days of managers who never opened the doors to new investors are gone," says Chris Jones, chief investment officer of Key Asset Management, a fund of funds.

I still believe there is a role for the good funds of funds, simply on numerical grounds. The hedge fund industry is so fragmented - with about 7,500 single manger funds and perhaps 2,000 funds of funds - that none but the very largest institutions can do all the work.

Fraud is a real risk in the hedge fund world, filled with fancy promises and demands for secrecy, and the investors are ill-equipped to root it out themselves.

Two decades ago, hedge funds obtained most of their funds directly from individuals and family trusts. Now, there are many more funds to deal with and institutional money is steadily encroaching.

But funds of funds need to work harder and show that they actually contribute something valuable. The lack of safeguards on Mr Madoff's operations was breathtaking - a tiny auditor, no separate custody assets or clearing of trades and so on.

# Listed funds

While the majority of hedge funds are not listed and benefit from a lax regulatory regime, there are some which list on stock markets, and so make themselves available for the retail investor, who is normally priced out of the hedge fund market. Being listed means that the shares are liquid (investors can easily sell or buy the shares on the stock market) and dealings have to be transparent (holdings of the fund have to be detailed in the annual report). Traditional hedge funds are illiquid and opaque. For example, the hedge fund run by Brevan Howard requires an initial investment of 20m; however, its BH Global Fund listed on the London Stock Exchange, offering investment in six of Brevan Howard's hedge funds, is available for £10.89 per share.

# UCITS

The aim of the UCITS regulation, launched by the European Union in 1985, was to allow collective investment schemes to operate freely throughout the EU on the authority of a single member state. The regulating country supervises these funds closely, restricting what they can do, but once approved in that country it can advertise itself to investors in other EU countries. The investors may be individuals or institutions. A requirement is for UCIT funds to be highly liquid permitting investors to be able to sell their investment at short notice; therefore the securities held by the fund must be readily tradable. They also have to be transparent (public disclosure of risks assumed and significant positions), and the portfolios must be well diversified. Also, the amount of leverage (borrowing, etc.) that can be used to gain exposure to underlying investments is constrained.

Historically, the UCITS structure was used merely for long only strategies, e.g. for long-term equity investment by unit trusts. The UCITS III update of 2001 allowed UCITS compliant funds to use derivatives and opened the way for hedge fund strategies to be used. With proposed new legislation in the EU and the US threatening to curtail and regulate normal hedge funds, many of them have decided to register their funds as onshore UCITS compliant funds, which opens up for them the lucrative retail non-professional market – see Exhibit 14.13. Hedge fund-style vehicles available within the UCITS III framework have been dubbed 'newcits'. Some of the hedge fund strategies are suitable for UCITS because they can be liquidated fairly quickly, such as equity long-short. But others, those that involve complex and illiquid strategies, are simply unsuitable.

# US hedge funds are quick to embrace the benefits of UCits

On a Monaco rooftop in June, the sun glittering over the Mediterranean as it dipped below the Cap d'Ail, about 200 hedge fund managers, many from the US, glugged champagne after a day discussing something rather less bubbly: "undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities".

Ucits, though, are the biggest thing in the hedge fund industry. Ostensibly a variety of European mutual fund, tightly regulated by EU laws, they have become the toast of London's Mayfair and now New York.

Thanks to the tweaks in the EU laws that created Ucits, hedge fund managers have discovered ways to repackage their strategies in Ucits funds. In doing so, they have accessed retail and institutional investors who had been shut out of the high-octane hedge fund work. According to consultancy Eurekahedge, there are nearly 100bn of Ucits-compliant hedge fund investments in about 980 funds open to retail investors, a number that has leapt in the past 18 months from almost nothing.

"Ucits hedge funds now account for 7 per cent of the total hedge fund universe of 1,500bn but have attracted 20 per cent of the net inflows into the industry year-to-date," according to Alexander Mearns, chief executive of Eurekahedge.

Hitherto, almost all Ucits startups have been European. But, as the accents in Monaco at the GAIM hedge fund conference this

June attested, there are signs that is changing.

The attraction for US managers - as for European - is twofold. First, Ucits funds are to be exempt from the forthcoming AIFM directive, and EU law that threatens to freeze US managers out of Europe. Second, Ucits are a way for hedge funds to tap a vast institutional investor base.

"There are a lot of European countries where it is very difficult for investors to put money into offshore hedge funds," according to Emmanuel Roman, co-chief executive of GLG Partners. "The bylaws of lots of companies in Germany and France prevent it." Ucits are familiar and saleable.

But there are problems. Ucits have to be highly liquid and transparent. They have investment limits. Mr Roman says: "There are some products for which it works

# Evolution of a European strategy

When European legislators created the Ucits fund designation in 1986, hedge funds were very far from their minds, writes Sam Jones in London.

The law was intended to harmonise long-only fund management products throughout the EU.

Ucits are required by law to be transparent and highly liquid, with diversified portfolios in readily-traded securities. Ucits funds cannot invest more than 10 per cent of their assets in commodities, for example.

Recent changes to EU law meant that Ucits funds could use derivatives, however, opening them up to hedge fund strategies for which being able to go short an instru meant is fundamental. While for liquid strategies such as equity long/short, managed futures, or even merger arbitrage, the leap into Ucits is achievable with relative ease, many worry that more complex unsuitable strategies are being shoehorned into Ucits in an effort to gather assets.

Investors, they say, could end up buying into products that are far riskier than they believe.

Critics say that Ucits funds are often imperfect - sometimes poor - replicas of the genuine offshore hedge funds they share names with and can underperform not least because of even higher fees than the typical hedge fund.

and some for which it doesn't: distressed, fixed income arbitrage, for example. The way I think about it is to imagine how the fund would fare if all the money had to come out in two weeks."

Paul Graham at UK fund manager Gartmore agrees. "What we do on the equity long/short hedge fund sides is extremely portable into the Ucits framework."

There is an added danger in trying to attract institutional investors into what was designed as a retail product, Mr Graham says. "They are not aligned with Mr Smith and Mrs Jones in Manchester or Cardiff, who have very different objectives to institutional investors. When they redeem their much larger investments, they can move prices." Were that to happen, small investors could get crushed.

In a 2011 survey conducted by Deutsche Bank 55 per cent of hedge fund investors said they preferred to allocate money to onshore UCITS hedge fund vehicles rather than offshore funds. Indeed, over the 2011-2012 period it is anticipated that more than $400 billion will flow into UCITS hedge funds, more than for traditional offshore hedge funds.

While the lure of being able to invest in a (expected-to-be) lucrative hedge fund has attracted considerable investment, results have not always been as expected, see Exhibit 14.14. It is reported that hedge fund UCITS vehicles returned just 4.1 per cent in 2010 far below the average gain for standard offshore hedge funds of about 10 per cent.

BlueCrest Capital, Europe's third-largest hedge fund, is to liquidate a $630m ($399m) fund that it launched last year.

The BlueCrest BlueTrend Ucits fund was an onshore version of the firm's successful computer-driven 9bn BlueTrend fund.

The move is one of the first setbacks in the recent growth of Ucits-compliant hedge funds vehicles. Ucits funds, which are regulated by European law, have historically been used exclusively by long-only asset managers.

Critics have long held that hedge fund Ucits products are not always suitable for those to whom they are marketed and are imperfect replicas of the strategies on which they are based.

As well as having exacting transparency and liquidity requirements, Ucits funds are restricted by European law as to which instruments they can invest in - an impediment that is understood to be behind BlueCrest's decisions to wind up its fund.

According to a letter sent out to shareholders on Wednesday, the BlueTrend Ucits fund was failing accurately to track the performance of the offshore BlueTrend parent fund. "It is anticipated, based on analysis by the investment manager,

BlueCrest Capital Management, that this tracking error may increase further in the economic conditions," said the letter.

Demand for the product has been high since it launched, thanks in part to the success of the fund on which it is based, BlueTrend.

BlueTrend has been one of the strongest performing hedge funds to emerge from the credit crisis, having returned 43 per cent in 2008. The BlueTrend Ucits fund was launched in 2009.

Another way for retail investors to dabble in hedge funds is to invest in a hedge fund ETF (see Chapter 4). ETFs are normally a fairly cheap way of investing (typically 0.15-0.50 per cent of assets each year go as fees). However, hedge fund ETFs incur all the costly hedge fund fees and do not always offer good returns. Marshall Wace launched a hedge fund ETF to mirror their top six hedge funds, on 1 March 2010 at an initial price of  $1002\mathrm{p}$  - see Exhibit 14.15.

By Sam Jones in New York

Marshall Wace, one of Europe's largest hedge funds, will today unveil plans to launch a publicly listed exchange-traded fund to track its flagship Tops fund strategy in an effort to rebuild assets after large redemptions in 2009.

The move marks a rekindling of a trend popular among top-tier hedge funds at the height of the boom to list versions of their restricted, proprietary strategies on stock exchanges.

The Marshall Wace vehicle, expected to raise $500m ($307m), will be structured as an ETF, the first such structure of its kind, and unlike a closed-ended listing will be able to grow in size according to investor demand.

The fund, to be named Marshall Wace Tops Global Alpha, will be listed on both the London and Frankfurt exchanges and will track an index designed to mirror the holdings of the six existing Marshall Wace Tops funds, proprietary hedge fund strategies currently only available to institutions and wealthy individuals.

Although the cost of running the Marshall Wace ETF itself for investors will remain small at 0.25 per cent annually, the underlying structure it tracks will still carry a 1.5 per cent annual charge and 20 per cent performance fee as is germane to hedge fund strategies.

The Tops (trade optimised portfolio system) strategy was conceived in 2001 by the then 21-year-old Anthony Clake and Ian Wace, the co-founder of the firm, and has courted praise and criticism in equal measure.

The system works by taking buy and sell recommendations from hundreds of brokers daily.

The recommendations are processed by a computer algorithm to sort out good ideas from bad ones.

Trades - and with them, healthy commissions - are routed via the brokers that submitted the best tips.

Critics have said the system leads to preferential advice from brokerages and potential market abuses, but the Financial Services Authority, the UK's market regulator, concluded the opposite in 2006.

In 2009, the six Tops funds returned between 6 per cent and 26 per cent, according to a person familiar with the situation.

On average, the funds have returned 10.9 per cent each year.

# Hedge fund indices

Some hedge funds have performed better than average, but many others are less than impressive being broadly similar to any other investment returns. There is a problem in judging performance because of a general lack of reliable and independently verifiable information about hedge funds, making it difficult to track returns. Nevertheless there are a number of hedge fund indices. The compilers of these are faced with great difficulties, not least that the underlying investments are often obscure instruments that lack a daily price setting in a liquid market, and so until the investment is sold (which may be years away) we cannot judge the performance.

Also, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of different strategies/types of assets bought and sold by hedge funds. This heterogeneity means that it is difficult to compare like with like - even within one asset class, say bonds, different fund managers will concentrate on bonds in different countries, credit-quality bands or issuer type. There is also the problem that each year hundreds of funds are launched and hundreds disappear, so it is difficult to figure out which fund performances to include in an index.

Fund participation (sending the information to an index creator) is voluntary which is likely to lead to self-selection bias because those that are doing well are more likely to volunteer to be included. There is also survivorship bias because those that have gone bust or folded through lack of interest due to poor performance may not be included in the index. End-of-life reporting bias occurs when a hedge fund is declining rapidly and stops reporting its performance to the index providers. Thus losses go unreported. Backfill bias occurs when a fund only starts reporting its performance when the strategy proves successful. The index compiler may then allow the successful managers to 'backfill' its historic data once the fund is ready (presumably after it has had a good run). This introduces a positive bias given that those that are never successful do not go into the index.

Some hedge fund index compilers are more rigorous than others. Hedge Fund Research, for example, insists that it eliminates survivorship bias by including all dead funds. Backfill bias is dealt with by only including performances after admission to the index.

# Leverage

One major concern with hedge funds is the amount of leverage they use. Leverage gives the opportunity to invest greater sums than the amount of investors' capital. Leverage can be achieved by borrowing to invest or by entering into a financial transaction where the fund only has to come up with, say, 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the underlying exposure as a margin or deposit. It allows for greater profits, but if things go awry, it also gives the possibility of unlimited losses - see Exhibit 14.16. Here the hedge fund has exposure to the returns on 100,000 shares currently priced at £4. This is long position; benefiting from rises. The fund has put down only 10 per cent of the underlying value, £40,000, to gain exposure to the price moves on £400,000 of shares. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, most likely to be through derivatives.

The problem with leverage was evidenced in a spectacular fashion in 1998, with the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management. With two Nobel-prize winning economists in its team, LTCM used a strategy called fixed income arbitrage, betting on minute differences in government bond prices and the expectation that these differences would converge. Because the differences were so small, it needed to use a huge amount of leverage to make a significant profit. Disaster struck when the Russian government defaulted on its bonds, causing bond prices in general to diverge considerably. LTCM had assets of  \$4 billion, but leverage of nearly\$ 130 billion (a ratio of over 30 to 1). It owed vast sums to other financial institutions. If it failed to pay its debt they might become insolvent. With such enormous potential losses, which could damage the economy, the Fed persuaded a group of banks to bail LTCM out. A more normal leverage ratio is around 2.5, meaning that for every £1 obtained from investors the manager gains exposure to the price movements on £2.50 of assets – see Exhibit 14.17. Note how wide the differences in leverage are for the different strategies.

# Hedge funds are wary of taking on more risk

In spite of a growing appetite for risk and a sense of a once-in-a-generation set of market opportunities, hedge fund managers continue to be wary in their use of leverage.

The days of "picking up nickels in front of a steamroller" - the metaphor by which high-octane, high-borrowing, hedge fund strategies used to be known - are still a distant thing of the past, even with individual blowups such as those of Platinum Grove, JWM Partners and Peloton Partners in recent memory.

By and large, hedge funds have access to more leverage than they need or are wary of taking on too much risk, following a volatile year in 2010.

On the one hand, bullish managers in the current environment have an abundance or market opportunities, while on the other, bearish managers remain fearful of another eurozone crisis.

While in 2009 the average hedge fund manager returned 24.57 per cent, 2010 saw an average return of just 10.58 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research. Poor performance last year was almost entirely down to a choppy and unpredictable market that caught out bulls early on and then burned bears at the end. Anyone whose positions were levered suffered all the more. Even notable bulls such as John Paulson were forced to retrench mid-year in response to macro-economic shocks. Last July the Paulson & Co Recovery fund told investors it has reduced its net exposure - a measure of directional bias - from 140 per cent to 107 per cent.

According to data from Credit Suisse, made available to its hedge fund clients last week, the average hedge fund started 2010 with leverage of about 2.53 times and ended the year with leverage of about 2.52 times, rising to as much as 2.68 in March.

In other words, for every  \$1 of client money a hedge fund had at the beginning of the year, the bank on average lent out a further\$ 1.53 to the fund on top.

The level has since risen to 2.65 times, says Credit Suisse - following growing confidence in December and a sense that an equity-led market rally would continue through this year.

The bank's figures may actually overstate the amount of leverage funds use, he says. "The actual number is likely to be lower since… cash balances are not captured. Leverage for the average equity long short manager is more likely to be around 140-160 per cent," he said.

Different hedge fund strategies have continued to use leverage to markedly different degrees.

Relative value specialists - which trade on pricing anomalies in fixed-income securities - are the only players that have significantly decreased their use of leverage in January, but their use of it remains well above the industry norm at 6.49 times and is inherent to the success of the strategy itself.

Other quantitative strategies, such as equity statistical arbitrage, have also continued to use high leverage. The average statistical arbitrage fund levers anywhere between 10 and 20 times, according to market participants.

In almost all cases, however, supply of leverage continues to outstrip demand.

"Broadly speaking the capacity to borrow has been greater than our requirements," says Pat Trew, chief risk officer at the 9bn multi-strategy London manager CQS. There is a disparity between the amount of leverage offered and the amount utilised. We haven't really seen a material increase in our funds' leverage over the past nine months."

# Hedge fund strategies

While it not possible to know exactly how many hedge funds there are (TheCityUK estimates there to be about 9,400 in 2010, Hedge Fund Intelligence collects data from 13,000), or to give a total amount invested, we can explain their most common strategies. Jones' original strategy was revised and a whole host of strategies emerged, all with one aim in mind: to make profit no matter what the state of world markets or economies, to make an absolute return. Some managers use analytical tools, some use financial modelling; all seek alpha. The range of hedge fund strategies changes over time as managers try to think up new schemes to exploit supposed superior information or analytical technique. The common themes linking them are that hedge funds are able to follow strategies that are often forbidden to traditional fund managers, managers are greatly incentivised by the fee structure, there is light regulation and a fundamental lack of transparency. Beyond that it is difficult to categorise the strategies as many of them overlap or comprise a mixture of strategies.

Here we have space to provide only a brief description of some of the strategies.

- Arbitrage is taking advantage of small discrepancies in the prices of the same financial instrument or similar securities by simultaneously selling the overpriced security and buying the underpriced security. So, for example, identical shares could be selling in a number of different stock markets, and because of differences in local supply and demand are selling at, say, one-tenth of 1 per cent difference in two of them. An arbitrageur will buy shares in the lowest priced arena and simultaneously sell them in the higher priced market, making an immediate profit. These acts will help to close the gap because the increased buying demand in the low priced market will raise prices there, and the additional supply in the high priced market will lower prices there. Arbitrage goes hand in hand with leverage; the price disparity is usually very small and so leverage is needed for the financial gain to be worthwhile. For example, if the discrepancy is one-tenth of 1 per cent on an instrument priced at £2.35, then to make £2,350 an investment of £2,350,000 must be made. If it is possible to borrow 90 per cent of a £23.5 million position, then the profit would be £23,500 if prices move according to plan, but huge losses can occur if price movements are unfavourable. If you borrow 90 per cent of the £23.5 million and the prices move the wrong way, you still owe £21.15m!
- Long/short strategy (relative value) involves buying one type of financial instrument long and selling another instrument short to exploit pricing anomalies between related (but not identical) assets that are mispriced relative to each other. Equity long/short (Jones' original strategy) has been successful for some hedge funds. Managers may divide the funds with a bias one particular way, e.g. 30 per cent of the fund can be exposed to short positions and 70 per cent long, or any particular ratio they choose. If leverage is used, a fund could be 30 per cent short and 100 per cent long, with the total of 130 per cent indicating leverage of 30 per cent. If the fund has a high exposure to short positions and a relative low exposure to longs (dedicated short bias) and then the market acts against their expectations a great deal of money can be lost. Exhibit 14.18 shows that because a share price could conceivably rise to any height short positions can lose multiples of the amount first committed.

# Exhibit 14.18 The implications of short selling

Sell short 100,000 shares @ £3.00 per share. Exposure = £300,000, gained with £60,000 of capital

<table><tr><td>If the share price moves to</td><td>£0.00</td><td>£2.50</td><td>£3.50</td><td>£6.00</td><td>£20.00</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 100,000 shares to close the position</td><td>£0</td><td>£250,000</td><td>£350,000</td><td>£600,000</td><td>£2m</td></tr><tr><td>Gain/loss</td><td>Maximum possible Gain £300,000</td><td>Gain £50,000</td><td>Loss £50,000</td><td>Loss £300,000</td><td>Loss £1.7m</td></tr></table>

Many funds apply long/short to two different stock market indices (and their derivatives) rather than individual shares. The long/short principle is also used for many other instruments, from bonds to derivatives.

- Market-neutral strategies are those that try to provide a return regardless of the overall market movement because the short position exposure is as great as the long position. The trader has no net exposure to broad market moves. They can be equity long/short, but are usually positions in other investments (often derivatives) where there is a price discrepancy to be exploited. The underlying strategy relies on the hope (not always fulfilled in the time that the hedge fund can maintain its position) that these prices will converge to a fair value.
- Fixed-income relative value/fixed-income arbitrage evolved from classical arbitrage, but instead of identical securities the two securities bought and sold are merely similar. This is not the traditional 'riskless arbitrage' where you are bound to make a profit buying and selling the same security; in contrast this approach is based on a theory of a 'normal' price relationship between two assets that are somewhat substitutes for each other. Hedge fund managers become convinced that the difference in price between two similar assets (say, AAA-rated bonds issued by Tesco and Sainsbury) is unreasonably wide (perhaps much greater than the historical norm, or fundamental analysis indicates a mispricing) or narrow and that they will revert to 'true relative value.' He/she sells short the relatively overpriced security and buys the underpriced security. Once prices have reverted to true value, the trade can be liquidated at a profit. However, these are risky strategies because the market can be perverse and push prices even further away from true value for many years. Another strategy is to benefit from small price differentials in fixed income securities such as two issues of US government bonds, say a 30-year bond and one that has 29 years to run. Because of the resources needed in terms of capital, professional ability and technological infrastructure, fixed income arbitrage tends to be used by larger hedge funds. Long Term Capital Management and Relative Value Opportunity II suffered using this strategy - see Exhibit 14.19.

# The storms that swept away Meriwether's flagship fund

FT

# Henny Sender

John Meriwether's decision to shutter his flagship Relative Value Opportunity II hedge fund, even as many other groups with a similar approach are flourishing, underscores how conditions in the hedge fund world have changed.

It is the second time Mr Meriwether has called it quits. In 1998, the implosion of Mr Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management led to fears for the stability of Wall Street.

Mr Meriwether's approach for his latest fund was a relative value strategy that sought to identify small price discrepancies across a range of securities, whether currencies or fixed income, for the leading economies and to take positions on the expectation that those anomalies would disappear.

But because the price moves can be so slight, the strategy relies on much borrowed money to produce adequate profits at the best of times.

Mr Meriwether, and other hedge fund managers, found that the desks of the Wall Street firms that financed them were no longer willing to do so, forcing them to sell securities in a market where demand vanished.

"To try to take advantage of relative mispricings turned out to be a crappy business," said one consultant, a former colleague of Mr Meriwether's.

"Whenever liquidity becomes an issue, you are exposed."

Those familiar with Mr Meriwether's portfolio said that as a value investor he was slow to cut his losses, and added to positions as securities became cheaper.

For example, some relative value funds, including Mr Meriwether's JWM Partners, bought a kind of Japanese government bond that was inflation protected, then accumulated more and more as the bonds dropped in value, and were left with big losses.

"You learn a certain trading style and it can be tough to change," the consultant said.

The Relative Value Fixed Income Convertible Arbitrage Index, the most comparable measure to the strategy employed by Mr

Meriwether's fund, was among the most disastrous strategies last year, down almost 34 per cent, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research.

Yet in this year's first half, the index gained almost 30 per cent.

Analysts say those hedge funds that have survived have done so by changing their style and adopting an approach which requires moving quickly to cut losses rather than doubling up as prices fall.

"The funds that have done well are those that have actually stopped doing traditional relative value trades and put on directional trades instead," said a managing director at a firm investing in a variety of hedge funds on behalf of institutions and wealthy families in New York.

"Traditional relative value is dead."

The manager cited MKP and Cura as examples of funds that had made a transition from leveraged relative value trading

- Convertible bond (warrant) arbitrage This is taking a long position in convertible bonds or warrants while hedging with a short position, typically by shorting shares in the same company. Convertible bonds and warrants are priced as a function of the share price; their value is derived from the price of the shares because they grant the right to convert to or purchase shares at a fixed price sometime in the future. However, occasionally they are not priced efficiently due to illiquidity in the convertible and warrant markets, because of uncertainty over the rights on the convertible and because of analyst neglect in these markets compared with the equity markets – the right to convert or purchase shares becomes underpriced. This is a form of risk 'arbitrage' and not the traditional risk-free arbitrage; the market can move prices even further away from the rational level for a long time.
- Event-driven strategies take advantage of special situations. For example, distressed securities investing is when hedge fund managers buy shares or debt belonging to companies which are experiencing serious financial problems and could be facing bankruptcy. They often believe that other investors have overreacted to the troubles and pushed market prices too low. Having investigated thoroughly, they think that a recovery of some value is possible. Other investors, particularly creditors, may lack the flexibility and patience of the hedge fund to hold onto distressed assets, e.g. pension funds are often forbidden from holding sub-investment grade bonds, banks may be desperate to remove loans no longer paying interest from their balance sheets. The other creditors may not have the time or the special knowledge to assist a company through a reorganisation of its finances, which can take several years – they would rather sell now, even at a low price.
- Merger arbitrage is another event-driven strategy. Often the shares of the target company will rise when the intention for one company to acquire the other is made public. Shares in the acquiring company often fall because of the tendency to over-pay and reduce shareholder value. Despite the price movements the share price of the target typically remains below the acquisition price. This is usually because of doubts in the market that the merger will be completed – the potential acquirer could just walk away, the target managers put up a good defence or a monopolies inquiry is launched. Or it may be because the market is underestimating the potential for a second bid or rival offer for the target. So some funds take a long position in the target and a short position in the acquirer. If the acquirer has offered shares in itself in return for the shares in the target when the offer is accepted the hedge fund exchanges its shares in the target for shares in the acquirer. These shares offset the earlier short position in the acquirer. A risk of this strategy is the possibility of the merger failing to go ahead (e.g. the monopoly regulator prevents it) and therefore the target's shares fall significantly while the acquirer's might rise.
- Activist strategy The hedge fund buys a portion of the shares in a company and uses the ownership to press for improvement in returns to shareholders. The hedge fund manager engages with the company's board and management. They may rally other shareholders to insist on one or more management actions: divestment; breaking up the group and selling off divisions; share buy-backs; raised dividends; mergers with other firms; or even sale of the entire business or liquidation.
- Global macro Funds profit (and lose) from bets taken against countries, currencies, global economic dislocations in interest rates and other macroeconomic variables. Using leverage, they typically take concentrated positions in any type of financial instrument (equity, currency, commodity, interest rates, etc.), trying to ensure that the downside would not be catastrophic, but the upside has unlimited potential. They try to anticipate global macroeconomic events anywhere in the world. Returns can be spectacular, such as when George Soros' Quantum fund took a major position against the value of the UK pound, anticipating that the pound would devalue in 1992. Soros was proved right and governments were forced to devalue and withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. He placed the equivalent of \$10 billion in currencies other than sterling. When it devalued, his investments in those other currencies went up when translated back into sterling. Soros is thought to have made \$1 billion from the dealings and became known as the man who broke the Bank of England. Soros saw a situation that was out of balance and which could not be maintained. Global macro positions may be 'directional' – betting on a rise in interest rates or a currency for example – or relative value – the pairing of two similar assets on a long and short position, looking for a current difference to change, e.g. the interest rate on US ten-year Treasuries to move relative to the interest rate on German Bunds.
- Fundamental growth Investing in companies they think have more earnings growth and capital appreciation potential than the average company.
- Fundamental value Investing in undervalued companies currently out of favour with the generality of investors.
- Multi strategy Funds use the same pool of investment to invest in different strategies. The idea is that diversification makes for more consistent returns, but the downside is that it also prevents full exploitation of a successful strategy.

# Prime brokerage

Prime broker services are mainly supplied by investment banks. They are an essential requirement for hedge funds as they provide the means for the funds to carry out their business, without getting tangled up in regulations. The banks stand ready to act as a broker, buying and selling securities; lend securities (for short selling); offer a central facility to enable clearing and settlement of trades; settlement is netted. Many prime brokers offer custody services, where securities can be safely stored. The many funds that depend on leverage to generate adequate returns given the tiny amounts involved in arbitrage could not function without prime brokers arranging the leverage.

Prime brokers may charge annual fees for some services offered, but their major revenue comes from the spreads on financing and stock arrangements, commission on trading and settlement fees. With the prime broker taking care of all these administrative tasks, fund managers can concentrate on their main function, making profitable investments for their clients.

Prime brokerage services are also discussed in Chapter 3.

# Private equity

We have looked at some of the details of raising money on the Stock Exchange in Chapters 8 and 9, but in the commercial world there are millions of companies which are not quoted on any stock exchange. We now consider a few of the ways in which equity capital is generated for these unquoted firms.

Private equity is mediumto long-term finance invested in companies not quoted on any stock exchange to profit from their growth. It enables companies which are unable to access further funding from current shareholders or banks to obtain the required funding from other investors. It is not easy to distinguish between private equity and venture capital. Some use the term private equity to define all unquoted company equity investment, others confine 'private equity' to investment in companies already well established, and apply 'venture capital' to investment in companies at an early stage of development with high growth potential.

Private equity/venture capital in its modern form began after the Second World War when a French immigrant, Georges Doriot, founded the American Research and Development Corporation (ARD) in 1946. ARD invested in and provided capital for new businesses, helping the economy regenerate after the Second World War. A gap was created because large, long-established and respectable companies listed on stock exchanges were more cautious in backing innovative projects which could lead to large potential losses, and equity and bond investors tended to concentrate their money on stock exchange quoted companies.

# Private equity funds

Private equity usually takes the form of a fund which then invests in a group of companies. Many investments result in total loss and so private equity investment in a single company can be a huge risk. The diversity of private equity funds gives greater opportunities for good overall returns, even if a high proportion of the investee companies turn out bad performances.

The private equity managers that run these funds, looking for and evaluating investment opportunities in companies, are known as the general partners (GPs). While other investors in the funds are called limited partners (LPs); these can be institutions or individuals. The GPs select companies which are deemed suitable for investment using finance provided by their limited partners, and sometimes loans and bank borrowings. Both the GPs and the LPs can make spectacular returns. Take the case of 3i's investment in Hyva (see Exhibit 14.20). The private equity fund bought the company for around €125 million and five years later sold it for €525 million.

# 3i turns profit with Hyva sale

By Martin Arnold

The private equity group 3i has realised one of its most profitable deals by selling Hyva, the leading make of hydraulic pumps for waste and tipper trucks, for €525m to Unitas Capital, the Hong Kong-based buy-out group.

The sale of Hyva, which is Dutch-based but makes 60 per cent of its revenues in Asia, has been hailed by Michael Queen, 3i chief executive, as proof that 3i can make big returns by buying European companies and expanding them in emerging markets.

"This is a rare opportunity to buy a company that has significant market-leading position in three of the four Bric economies:

China, India and Brazil," said John Lewis, a partner at Unitas Capital, the former Asian buy-out arm of JPMorgan.

Unitas, which has about  $4bn ($ 2.6bn) under management, saw off competition for Hyva from Chongqing Machinery & Electric, the Chinese state-controlled industrial group, and buy-out rivals Nordic Capital, Permira and Bain Capital.

3i bought Hyva for €125m in 2004, investing €30.7m of equity and raising debt from ABN Amro. When 3i recapitalised the company in late 2006, it was repaid €25m and it increased its stake by buying out another shareholder the following year.

The Dutch-based hydraulic company has more than trebled revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation under 3i's ownership to a forecast of €490m (£417m) and €65 respectively this year.

A decisive factor in Unitas winning the deal was its ability to raise about €250m of debt from Asian-based lenders, including Standard Chartered, Nomura, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

3i has sold companies worth more than €2.5bn this year.

The GPs are paid management fees (usually 1-2.5 per cent) and a share (usually about 20 per cent) in the eventual capital gain, known as the carried interest (the carry). The fees cover all the management expenses of administering the private equity company or fund, and provide an income for GPs during lean times when the fund has not sold profitable investments. Limited partners may include pension or insurance funds, wealthy individuals or families, or sovereign wealth funds. Exhibit 14.21 shows the sources of funding for UK funds from 2007 to 2009.

When the investee company is sold, or the private equity fund closed, the LPs share the remaining 80 per cent of the carried interest.

# The size of the private equity and venture capital industry

In the UK, the British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (BVCA), formed over 25 years ago, is the voice of the private equity and venture capital industry. It has more than 470 members managing more than £32 billion of funds between them. In 2010, BVCA members invested a total of £20,447 million, £12,210 million overseas and £8,237 million in the UK. While this sounds a lot, it is less than the amount invested in previous years – see Exhibit 14.22.

The European Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (EVCA) has been performing a similar task in Europe for about the same length of time. Its report shows a similar decrease in its figures for 2009, and some recovery in 2010 at €42.6 billion – see Exhibit 14.23.

In the US, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), represents the US venture capital industry. Its report (Exhibit 14.24) shows a decrease for 2009, but not as dramatic as the UK and European decreases (the figure for 2010 is €23.2 billion). It is interesting to see on the chart the results of the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s and 2000, when venture capital poured into internet start-ups at every level. Like the tulipmania mentioned in Chapter 13, the internet craze seemed ever expanding and ever profitable, until 2000, when over 100 billion of venture capital was invested. In March 2000, the NASDAQ collapsed. This was the place that so many companies backed by private equity and venture capital had initial public offerings, turning themselves into stock market quoted companies. Most of these plummeted in value in 2000, trillions of dollars of value were lost and the venture capital industry shrank as investors became afraid of backing speculative ventures.

The effect of the financial crisis of 2008 is also apparent in Exhibit 14.25. Notice that in the years 2005 to 2009 the private equity funds raised hundreds of billions more than they actually invested. Thus, today we have many funds with large stockpiles of cash looking for an investment home. Many managers are waiting like vultures to pick up companies cheap in the aftermath of the recession. The US has the biggest share of the private equity market with 36 per cent of investments, and the UK is the next largest with 13 per cent of all global investments.

# Why is private equity needed?

While more mature companies can turn to the stock market to raise debt or equity capital and small companies can usually rely on retained earnings, capital injections from the founder family and bank borrowing for growth, in between these lie financing gaps; intermediate businesses which are too large or too fast growing to ask the individual shareholders (family and friends) for more funds or to obtain sufficient bank finance, but are not yet ready to launch on the stock market. Also there are many small start-up businesses with great ideas who simply lack wealthy family and friends able to put up the large amounts of equity capital needed to get going in the first place. Private equity may also provide funding for under-performing companies or those in financial difficulties which would prosper given adequate funds. Thus, for all these reasons companies frustrated in their plans to exploit market opportunities due to a lack of available funds have welcomed the rapid development of the private equity industry over the past 40 years to fill these gaps in financing.

The costs and inconveniences of being listed on a stock market mean that many managers and shareholders prefer to obtain additional funds from private equity funds – even those that are perfectly capable of raising money on stock markets deliberately stay away from them. Private equity funds can be more long-term focused than stock market investors, allowing higher near-term investment in, say, research and development or marketing even at the expense of this year's or next year's earnings per share figures. The corporate managers also avoid the hassle of regular time-consuming meetings with institutional shareholders, so they are freer to get on with the job of creating long-term wealth for shareholders. They might also welcome the technical/managerial expertise and contacts that many private equity funds can draw on – many funds specialise in particular industries and develop a deep talent pool. Also, private equity shareholders are more likely to be in favour of granting directors and senior managers shares in the company if they perform well. This can make them very wealthy.

It is estimated by the BVCA that there are 10,000 UK companies with 3m employees (one in six of the non-government workforce) financed by private equity money, so it is clear that private equity investment is crucial to the UK economy. Exhibit 14.26 provides a list of some well-known UK companies which are backed by private equity.

# Business angels (informal venture capitalists)

Business angels are wealthy individuals who provide their own money to be used as capital in new business ventures. They generally have substantial business and entrepreneurial experience, and usually invest between £10,000 and £250,000 primarily in start-up, early-stage or expanding firms. About three-quarters of business angel investments are for sums of less than £100,000 and the average investment is £25,000–30,000. The majority of investments are in the form of equity finance but they do purchase debt instruments and preference shares. The companies they invest in will be years away from obtaining a quotation or being advanced enough for a sale to other companies or investors, so in becoming a business angel the investor accepts that it may be difficult to dispose of their shares, even if the company is progressing well. They also accept a high degree of risk of complete failure – which happens in about one in three cases. They usually do not have a controlling shareholding and they are willing to invest at an earlier stage than most formal venture capitalists – see Exhibit 14.27. They often dislike the term business angel,

Technology start-up companies say they are increasingly turning to angel investors and their own resources as venture capital groups become increasingly reluctant to provide funding.

Kate Jillings, co-founder of BusinessBecause.com, a news and networking site for business schools, sold her flat to fund the business after deciding that it was not even worth trying to get VC investment.

"We had to weigh up whether to invest time in the business and growing the revenues or whether we chased investors." Ms Jillings says.

"We decided it was more sensible to fight for revenue than fight for funding. We initially funded it through our savings and debt. We got to the point where we had put so much of ourselves in the business, we didn't want to spend two months on the investor merry go round."

World on a Hanger and Empora. com, two UK-based fashion websites, on the other hand, have found that angel investors are often stepping into the gap left by VCs. Highly professional "super angels" - usually formerly successful entrepreneurs who are investing their gains back into the market - are becoming increasingly prominent in the market.

Empora.com, for example, raised money from Alexander Straub, the internet entrepreneur and investor. Robin Klein, Doug Richard of television's Dragon's Den fame and the Samver brothers in Germany are among the many others active on the angel scene.

"Risk aversion among VCs has grown. But for riskier deals there are now more internet savvy angels than ever to fill the gap," says Ari Helgason, co-founder of World on a Hanger.

preferring the title informal venture capitalist. They are generally looking for entrepreneurial companies which have high aspirations and potential for growth.

A typical business angel makes one or two investments in a three-year period, often in an investment syndicate (with an archangel, an experienced angel investor, coordinating the group). They generally invest in companies within a reasonable travelling distance from their homes because most like to be 'hands-on' investors, playing a significant role in strategy and management – on average angels allocate ten hours a week to their investments. Most angels take a seat on the board and are actively involved. On the other hand, there are many who have infrequent contact with their companies. Business angels are patient investors willing to hold their investment for at least a five-year period.

# How business angels work

The main way in which firms and angels find each other is through friends and business associates, although there are a number of formal networks. See British Venture Capital Association at www.bvca.co.uk for a list of networks. Angel network events are organised where entrepreneurs can make a pitch to potential investors, who, if they like what they hear in response to their questions, may put in tens of thousands of pounds. The popular *Dragon's Den* programme produced by the BBC is an example of business angels at work. Entrepreneurs put forward their ideas to the 'Dragons', and if they are thought to be a good investment money from the Dragons will be invested. Prior to the event, the TV producers will arrange screening of the business opportunities to avoid time wasting by total no-hopers. Similar screening is generally carried out before an angel network event.

To be a member of a network, investors are expected either to earn at least £100,000 per year or to have a net worth of at least £250,000 (excluding main residence). If an investor has a specialist skill to offer, for example they are an experienced company director or chartered accountant, membership may be permitted despite a lower income or net worth.

Entrepreneurs need to be aware that obtaining money from informal venture capitalists is no easy task – the rejection rate runs at over 90 per cent; but if rejected the determined entrepreneur has many other angel networks to try. Returns on business angel investments are mostly negative. However, they can be spectacular; the angels who put €2 million into Skype multiplied their money by 350 times when the company was sold to eBay for €2.1 billion in 2005.

# Venture capital

The business ideas backed by venture capitalists are usually new, innovative, often high-tech and usually very risky, brought to them by entrepreneurs. With little or no trading track record or financial history, new companies usually find obtaining finance for growth and expansion difficult, and this is where venture capital may be the solution. Venture capital is a mediumto long-term investment and can consist of a package of debt and equity finance. Many of the investments are into little more than a management team with a good idea – which may not have started selling a product or even developed a prototype. It is believed, as a rule of thumb in the venture capital industry, that out of ten investments two will fail completely, two will perform excellently and the remaining six will range from poor to very good.

# Venture capital funds

Venture capital funds are intermediaries who channel money from institutions or individuals into investment in private companies. Their aim is to help a number of companies grow in the expectation that in the future a company can be sold or floated on a stock exchange for a considerable profit. As with private equity, venture capital fund managers are the GPs who actively participate in and manage the venture capital investment fund. The LPs, such as pension funds or individuals, provide the capital for the venture capitalist to invest.

As we discussed in Chapter 8, high risk goes with high return. Venture capitalists therefore expect to get a return of between five and ten times their initial equity investment in about 5-7 years. This means that the firms receiving equity finance are expected to produce annual returns of at least 26 per cent. Alongside the usual drawbacks of equity capital from the investors' viewpoint (last in the queue for income and on liquidation, etc.), investors in small unquoted companies also suffer from a lack of liquidity because the shares are not quoted on a public exchange.

# Types of support

Private equity and venture capital offer support to a wide range of companies at varying stages in their development.

# Seedcorn

A form of venture capital providing financing to allow the development of a business concept. Development may also involve expenditure on the production of prototypes and additional research. Usually involves angel investor funding rather than venture funds.

# Start-up

Also referred to as venture capital, a product or idea is further developed and/or initial marketing is carried out. The companies involved are very young and have not yet sold their product commercially. Usually involves angel investor funding rather than venture funds.

# Other early-stage

Again, often referred to as venture capital, funds are provided for initial commercial manufacturing and sales. Many companies at this stage will remain unprofitable. Usually involves angel investor funding rather than venture funds.

# Expansion (development or growth)

Companies at this stage are on to a fast-growth track and need extra financial support to fund increased production capacity, working capital and for the further development of the product or market. The company may be large enough to accept substantial investment from venture funds – if not then angel investment is more likely.

# Management buyout (MBO)

The acquisition of a company or part of a company by an existing management team. A team of managers buy a whole business, a subsidiary or a section from their employers, so that they own and run it for themselves. Companies are often willing to sell to these teams, if the business is under-performing or does not fit with the strategic core business. The MBO team has limited funds and so calls on private equity to provide the bulk of the finance.

# Management buy-in (MBI)

The acquisition of a company or part of a company by a new management team from outside the company. The new team of managers usually have insufficient finance to complete the deal and so partner with a private equity fund that usually buys the majority of the shares

# Leveraged buyout (LBO)

The buyout of an existing company, with the capital raised (and therefore the capital structure for the company afterwards) being between 60 and 90 per cent debt finance. One advantage of this is that interest on debt is tax deductible, and therefore less company tax is paid. The major disadvantage is the risk of insolvency with so much debt to be serviced. Private equity groups usually provide the bulk of the equity and perhaps some of the debt or preference share capital with the rest coming from banks or the financial markets.

# Secondary purchase

A private equity backed company is sold to another private equity fund. This is one of the exit strategies, where the first private equity fund can make a capital gain by selling its equity in the company to another private equity fund

# Public-to-private (PTP)

The management of a company currently quoted on a stock exchange may return it to unquoted status with the assistance of private equity finance to buy the shares, giving it the advantage of lower costs, less regulation and official and public scrutiny.

Private equity firms are less keen on financing seedcorn, start-ups and other early-stage companies than expansions, MBOs, MBIs and PTPs. This is largely due to the very high risk associated with early-stage ventures and the disproportionate time and costs of financing smaller deals. To make it worthwhile for a private equity or venture capital organisation to consider a company, the investment must be at least £250,000 – the average investment is about £5 million – and it is difficult to find funding for investments of less than £2 million. Business angels are the solution for lesser funding requirements.

Because of the greater risks associated with the youngest companies, the private equity or venture capital funds may require returns of the order of 50-80 per cent per annum. For well-established companies with a proven product and battle-hardened and respected management the returns required may drop to the high 20s. These returns may seem exorbitant, especially to the managers set the task of achieving them, but they have to be viewed in the light of the fact that many private equity or venture capital investments will turn out to be failures and so, taken overall, the performance of the funds is significantly less than these figures suggest. In fact, the BVCA, which represents 'every major source of venture capital in the UK', reports that returns on funds are not excessively high - see Exhibit 14.28.

# Martin Arnold

Private equity has been attacked before. Trade unions have branded buy-out bosses as asset-strippers and job-cutters. Politicians have rebuked them for dodging tax. But now the industry is being criticised at its core: financial performance.

The main theme of today's report from the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a London think-tank, is to ask why supposedly sophisticated investors, including pension funds, keep putting money into an asset class that underperforms.

As evidence for this underperformance, it cites a 2005 paper by Steven Kaplan, of the University of Chicago and Antoinette Schoar of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which found that net of fees the average buy-out fund underperformed the S&P 500 between 1980 and 2001.

Given that private equity is an illiquid asset class, locking up investors' money for as long as 10 years, and is more risky, because of the extra debt used in many leveraged buy-outs, this underperformance is a serious indictment.

Backing up these claims, the report's author, Peter Morris, a

The credit crisis has caused some big buy-out deals to implode. Terra Firma has written down to zero the equity it invested in a  $4.2bn ($ 6.5bn) buy-out of EMI, while struggling to stop lender Citigroup taking control of the music group.

Mr Morris also criticises the standard used to measure most private equity performance: the internal rate of return. He argues that because it tracks performance over the life of a fund but does not take into account the timing of when money flows into and back out of different deals, the IRR sometimes inflates returns.

To explain why investors continue to put money into an underperforming asset class, Mr Morris says: "One possibility is that some investors may simply not understand."

Alternatively he says private equity could be a way for pension funds to "roll the dice" by doing riskier debt-funded deals, but to do it "under the table" by outsourcing it to a buy-out group that can take the blame if things go awry.

He also attacks the fee structure of private equity which is based on a fee of 2 per cent of funds raised and a 20 per cent cut of profits made.

Citing a study by Andrew Metrick, of the Yale School of Management, and Ayako Yusado, of the University of California, he says that two-thirds of private equity managers' income comes from fixed fees and only a third from performance-related pay.

"The risk is all taken by the investors and, beyond them, by the taxpayers who underwrite the world's financial system," he says. "But a disproportionate share of the upside goes to the managers, in the form of fees and profit share."

Yet private equity's supporters point to other studies showing it outperforms the stock market. Research published last month by the HEC School of Management and the London Business School found that 20 funds of funds managed by Pantheon had achieved average

annual returns of 19.6 per cent, beating comparable public markets.

"I do think private equity deserves some credit for its use of debt and for its market selection," says Simon Walker, chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.

"[The CSFI report] is unbalanced and it is a beat-up. I'm not saying it is worthless. But we'd love to have a serious discussion on it."

The report concludes by calling for private equity fees to reward only the alpha they generate, not the benefits of extra debt or rising stock markets. It also says that private equity groups should disclose more information on their performance and activities to "allow outsiders to hold them accountable".

"Complexity and opacity are usually not signs of brilliance but evidence of rent-seeking," it says, warning that the behaviour of supposedly sophisticated investors may need as much scrutiny as that of banks.

Venture capital funds are rarely looking for a controlling shareholding in a company and are often content with a 20 or 30 per cent share. However, MBI/MBO/LBO funds usually take most of the shares of a company because the management team can only afford a small proportion of the shares. The fund may also provide money by purchasing convertible preference shares which gives it rights to convert to ordinary shares – this will boost its equity holding and increase the return if the firm performs well. It may also insist, in an initial investment agreement, on some widespread powers. For instance, the company may need to gain the private equity/venture capitalist's approval for the issue of further securities, and there may be a veto over the acquisition of other companies.

Even though their equity holding is generally less than 50 per cent the venture capital funds frequently have special rights to appoint a number of directors. If specific negative events happen, such as a poor performance, they may have the right to appoint most of the board of directors and therefore take effective control. More than once the founding entrepreneur has been aggrieved to find themselves removed from power. (Despite the loss of power, they often have a large shareholding in what has grown to be a multi-million-pound company.) They are often sufficiently upset to refer to the fund which separated them from their creation as 'vulture capitalist'. But this is to focus on the dark side. When everything goes well, we have, as they say in the business jargon, 'a win-win-win situation': the company receives vital capital to grow fast, the venture capitalist receives a high return and society gains new products and economic progress.

Many of the UK's most noteworthy companies were helped by the venture capital industry, as we saw in Exhibit 14.26, and US companies such as Google, Apple, Starbucks and Sun Microsystems also developed through venture capital in the US.

# Private equity categories

As you have gathered by now, as share investment outside stock markets has grown it has become differentiated. The main categories are shown in Exhibit 14.30. with private equity as the umbrella term covering the various activities. In this more differentiated setting the term venture capital is generally confined to describing the building of companies from the ground floor, or at least from a very low base.

# Exhibit 14.30 Categories of private equity

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/af0b66dd0a4b406d347d4f23e2549514d6673c697941244bf61745c7d588c22a.jpg)

Management buyouts and buy-ins of established businesses (already off the ground floor) have become a specialist task, with a number of dedicated funds. Many of these funds are formed as private partnerships by wealthy individuals, a high proportion of funds are American owned.

Small investors can buy shares in listed private equity (LPEQ) funds which are companies investing in unquoted companies but which have their own shares quoted on a stock exchange. There are about 80 investable listed private equity companies in Europe, with a total market capitalisation of €45 billion, of which €12 billion are London-listed companies (see www.lpeq.com). They come in two varieties: first, those that are straightforward listed companies, and those that are listed as investment trusts. An example of the first type is Conversus Capital, which is listed on Euronext-Amsterdam. It has 2.5 billion in assets under management, and a portfolio of over 1,800 unquoted companies in North America, Europe and Asia.

Private equity investment trusts (PEITs) are the second type of LPEQs. They are stock market quoted investment trusts with a focus on investing their shareholders' money in more risky unquoted developing companies. The disadvantage of listed private equity companies is the absence of special tax concessions compared with Venture Capital Trusts and Enterprise Investment Schemes – see below. However, investors are able to exit their investments easily by dealing on the stock market.

# Venture capital trusts

It is important to distinguish between venture capital funds and venture capital trusts (VCTs) which are investment vehicles with important tax breaks designed to encourage investment in small and fast-growing companies. VCTs are companies whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. The tax breaks for investors putting money into VCTs include an immediate relief on their current year's income at 30 per cent (by putting £10,000 into a VCT an investor will pay £3,000 less tax on income, so the effective cost is only £7,000). Any returns (income and capital gains) on a VCT are exempt from tax. Investors can place up to £200,000 each per year into VCTs. These benefits are only available to investors buying new VCT shares who hold the investment for five years. The VCT managers can only invest in companies with gross assets less than £15 million and the maximum amount a VCT is allowed to put into each unquoted company's shares is limited to £1 million per year. 'Unquoted' for VCT means not listed on the main list of the London Stock Exchange but can include AIM and PLUS companies. A maximum of 15 per cent of the VCT fund can be invested in any one company. Up to half of the fund's investment in qualifying companies can be in the form of loans. These trusts offer investors a way of investing in a broad spread of small firms with high potential, but with greater uncertainty, in a tax-efficient manner. But beware, many of the funds that have been in operation for a few years have shown low returns due to a combination of poor investment selection and high management charges.

# Enterprise Investment Scheme

Another government initiative to encourage the flow of risk capital to smaller companies is the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS). Income tax relief at 30 per cent is available for investments from £500 up to a maximum of £1 million made directly (no need for a fund manager as with VCTs) into qualifying company shares. There is also capital gains tax relief, and losses within EISs are allowable against income tax. Investment under EIS means investing when the company issues shares, not the purchase of shares in the secondary market. The tax benefits are lost if the investments are held for less than three years. Investors are not allowed to hold more than 30 per cent of the shares in any EIS company. Certain trading activities which are excluded, such as finance, property and agriculture (HMRC gives the definitive list of these exclusions). The company must have fewer than 250 full-time employees. It must not be quoted on LSE's Main Market and the most it can raise under the EIS in any one year is usually £10 million. The company must not have gross assets worth more than £15 million. Funds which invest in a range of EIS companies are springing up to help investors spread risk. EIS investors are unlikely to be able to regain their investment until the company is sold or floated on a stock market as there is usually no share trading for many years.

# Private equity providers

There are a number of different types of private equity providers, although the boundaries are increasingly blurred as a number of funds now raise money from a variety of sources. The independents can be firms, funds or investment trusts, either quoted or private, which have raised their capital from more than one source. The main sources are pension and insurance funds, but banks, corporate investors, sovereign wealth funds and private individuals also put money into these private equity or venture capital funds. Captives are funds managed on behalf of a parent institution (banks, pension funds, etc.). Semi-captives invest funds on behalf of a parent and also manage independently raised funds.

# How an independent private equity fund is established and managed

Many private equity funds are established as limited liability partnerships (LLP), raising capital from a group of investors. It is usually stated at the outset that it will be run down after 10 or 12 years and the value in the LLP will be distributed to members. The project is touted to potential investors (e.g. pension funds), often by the investor relations team or by using external placement agents. The investment strategy is set out, e.g. a focus on bio-technology or internet companies. The general partners will state a minimum to be raised to reach 'first close'. When this is achieved the fund comes into existence. There may be a series of 'closes' beyond the minimum to create a much larger fund. The 'final close' is the end of the capital-raising phase.

The investment phase now begins. The GPs are given discretion to invest the money; they are usually given a period of up to five years to do so. They are likely to limit exposure to any one investment to less than 10 per cent of the fund. They might arrange to borrow money to complete individual deals. For the larger investments, particularly MBOs and MBIs, the private equity fund may provide only a fraction of the total funds required. Thus, in a £50 million buyout the LLP might supply (individually or in a syndicate with other private equity funds), say, £15 million in the form of share capital (ordinary and preference shares). Another £20 million may come from a group of banks in the form of debt finance. The remainder may be supplied as mezzanine debt – high-return high-risk debt which usually has some rights to share in equity values should the company perform.

Occasionally the LPs are given the opportunity to both participate in an investment via the private equity fund and to invest directly. This is called co-investing.

The fund usually holds on to the investments for three, five or more years to allow it to improve and grow. When the company is in a thriving state they are likely to sell to realise a return on their investment. This is called an exit – the various types of exits are discussed in the next section.

The performance-related return (carried interest) due to the GPs is generally based on the performance of the entire fund rather than on individual deals – although some do give deal-by-deal carried interest. In the first five years the managers are likely to be most dependent on the management fee of 1–2.5 per cent of funds under management rather than carried interest. In the period after five years they are likely to be most motivated by the carried interest on the maturing investments. The various stages are set out in Exhibit 14.31.

# Exits

The exit is when private equity and venture capital investors reap their rewards; this is their goal towards which all efforts have been expended. Before the expiry of the fund (say after ten years) moves will be made to sell the investments. Hopefully the companies within the fund will have prospered or been reorganised enough to make it an attractive proposition for resale or listing on a stock exchange.

Only when the investee company is sold do the private equity or venture capital partners receive any return on their investment, except for the GPs who receive annual fees.

Exhibit 14.31 The operation of a private equity fund

The exit options are:

# Repurchase

The company has prospered and the existing management is in a position to purchase the equity in the company, often accompanied by a general recapitalisation of the firm – more debt taken on.

# Secondary/Tertiary/Quaternary buyouts

The equity is sold to another private equity group. This may then be sold on to a third buyer (tertiary buyout) and on occasions, a fourth (quaternary buyout) – see Exhibit 14.32.

# Trade sale

The equity is sold to or merged with another company – usually one in the same industry – and a capital gain (loss) is realised for investors.

# Going public

The equity is floated on a stock market (see Chapter 9) and a capital gain is realised for investors.

# Liquidation

The worst exit strategy – the company goes bust and everyone makes a loss.

# Revolving door leaves investors dizzy

What do French retailer Picard Surgeles, the US provider of healthcare cost management services Multiplan and the UK chain of betting shops Gala Coral have in common?

They are all companies in the hands of their third or fourth consecutive private equity owners, as the trend for buy-out groups to sell assets to each other leaves come companies stuck in the revolving door of "pass-the-parcel" deals.

Picard Surgelés was sold for €1.5bn (2bn) last week to Lion Capital, which became the third private equity owner of France's leading frozen-food chain after earlier buy-outs by BC Partners and candover.

In a similar vein, Multiplan was sold last month for 3.1bn, making BC Partners and Silver Lake Partners the new owners following on from Carlyle and initially General Atlantic.

Going one step further, a consortium of distressed debt investors led by Apollo Management and Cerberus recently took over Gala Coral, making them its fourth set of private equity owners.

What is it about these companies that means they keep passing between private equity owners rather than being floated on to the stock market or sold to a bigger trade buyer? And what do investors think about the spread of pass-the-parcel deals?

"We didn't IPO the company [Picard] now because it comes off two years of flat earnings, but it is definitely IPO-able in short order," says Andre François-Poncet, head of BC Partners' office in Paris.

Even some firms that usually steer clear of pass-the-parcel deals are starting to do some.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts recently bought UK pet accessory chain Pets at Home and Nordic healthcare group Ambea from rival buy-out groups.

"There is a lot of new stuff here at Pets at Home that can be done, without taking away from the great stuff they've already been doing," says John Pfeffer, head of KKR's retail industry team in Europe.

As examples he cites further improved sourcing of products, expansion of own-label brands, bolstering of online sales and better use of space in stores.

"We can draw on our deep retail experience, having done more than 57bn of retail deals," he said.

There are well-known cases of tertiary buy-outs hitting the wall, such as Gala Coral, which was taken over by its lenders last month, triggering 700\mathrm{m} (1bn) losses for its buy-out owners, and Simmons, the US mattress maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2009.

However, some companies have thrived after a tertiary buy-out, such as Merlin Entertainment, operator of the London Eye, Madame Tussauds and Legoland theme parks, and Jimmy Choo, the maker of diamante-encrusted stilettos.

Towerbrook bought Jimmy Choo for  $185\mathrm{m}$  three years ago, becoming the third successive private equity owner of the company that has risen from a one-man backstreet atelier to shoemaker for the stars in little more than a decade.

John Harley, Ernst & Young's global head of private equity, says: "You need to look at the entrepreneur behind these companies, as often they want to keep driving the company forward and choose another private equity owner rather than an IPO."

# Concluding comments

Hedge funds and private equity have come in for more than their fair share of sensational headlines. However, the bulk of all their business consists of perfectly acceptable financial transactions. The problem with hedge funds is that they appear to be making more money for people who are wealthy already and it is difficult to see the benefits they bring to the general public. John Paulson made over 4 billion for his fund by betting that mortgage lending in the US had reached unsustainable levels and would have to fall. His predictions were right: mortgage lending was spiralling out of control and reaching bubble proportions and millions of people suffered as the housing market contracted. The bubble had to burst, and we welcome a view different to the complacent consensus. Perhaps we should pay more attention to the signals sent to the market by people like John Paulson that investors were generally being too optimistic about US mortgages. Should a fund manager be criticised because he made correct predictions? But is it right that so much profit should be made? Paulson, and many other individuals who have made significant amounts of money out of financial markets, such as Warren Buffett and George Soros, have shown truly philanthropic conduct and donated billions of dollars to various charities.

Paulson and Soros certainly showed the ability to generate alpha in their investments, but alpha appears to have been becoming rarer for two related reasons. First, the sheer volume of trading may be reducing the chance of finding market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance. Second, the remuneration model is attracting more managers, which may dilute the talent available in the industry. It is harder to find a different path when there are so many participants.

Just as there will always be people with good business ideas but not the means to put them into production, so there will always exist people with spare money looking for an interesting investment outside the stock market and able to face the risk of a total loss of their investment. In a nutshell, that is private equity.

Private equity has come in for a considerable amount of criticism over the treatment of some investee companies. In certain cases, when private equity became involved, the reorganisation initiated major asset sales ('asset stripping' according to the critics), sacking workers and curtailing expensive research and development, which may have resulted in raised short-term profits and the increasing attractiveness of the company to other buyers, but critics feel that these actions are damaging to long-term economic stability and prosperity.

But bear in mind that without private equity many companies that now thrive as household names would not have got off the ground. Companies such as Google, Skype and CenterParcs have brought great pleasure as well as wealth. These are usually high-risk ventures and we need skilful fund managers to continue to make profits for their investors and receive suitable recompense for their efforts and risk taking.

# Key points and concepts
- A hedge fund is a collective investment vehicle that operates relatively free from regulation allowing it to take steps in managing a portfolio that other fund managers are unable to take, e.g. borrowing to invest, shorting securities.
Hedge funds originated in the US, and were based on absolute return, rather than striving to achieve a return relative to a market index as conventional funds tend to aim for.
US hedge funds are permitted to sell to accredited investors, i.e. those thought wealthy enough or professional enough not to need the protection of the SEC. They are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of a hedge fund investment – individual investors must have net worth, or joint net worth with a spouse, that exceeds  \$1m at the time of purchase, or income exceeding\$ 200,000.
- Money invested in hedge funds is often locked up for a period during which time the funds are not available for withdrawal by the ultimate investors. Funds may also be gated; a limit is placed on the amount that can be withdrawn from the fund at any one time.
- A side pocket enables a fund manager to separate a difficult to value or illiquid investment from all other investments.
- Many hedge funds register offshore (e.g. Cayman Islands) where regulations and tax are lighter.
Hedge funds are generally opaque, not obliged to disclose any dealings except to investors.
- Alpha is the return achieved above the return expected given the risk class of investment that a fund manager engages in – the 'risk-adjusted return'.
Hedge funds are managed by investment companies which are usually registered onshore.
- Typical hedge fund management fees are 1-5 per cent annual fee, 15-50 per cent performance fee. The most common is 2 per cent plus 20 per cent.
- High water marks (loss carryforward provision): where a fund's performance has dropped, the manager does not receive a performance fee until the fund reaches its previous position.
- Hurdle rates: performance fees will only be triggered once the fund has achieved a minimum annualised performance.
Fund of hedge funds - a manager invests in a range of hedge funds; two lots of fees are charged. Advantages are of diversification and a manager who investigates the quality of hedge funds.
Listed hedge funds trade on stock markets and so are available to retail investors.
- UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) regulation allows collective investment schemes to operate freely throughout the EU on the authority of a single member state. A requirement is for UCITs funds to be highly liquid, therefore the securities held by the fund must be readily tradeable. They also have to be transparent and the portfolios must be well diversified. The amount of leverage that can be used is constrained. UCITs compliant funds can use derivatives and other hedge fund strategies.
Hedge fund ETFs are more costly than normal ETFs.
- Hedge fund indices aim to replicate hedge fund performance. But there are difficulties: a general lack of reliable and independently verifiable information; the underlying investments are often obscure instruments that lack a daily price setting in a liquid market; there are hundreds of different strategies/types of assets bought and sold by hedge funds, therefore it is difficult to compare like with like; each year hundreds of funds are launched and hundreds disappear, so it is difficult to figure out which fund performances to include in an index; fund participation in an index is voluntary (self-selection bias); there is survivorship bias because those that have gone bust or folded through lack of interest due to poor performance will not report to the index compiler. There is also end-of-life bias and backfill bias.
- Leverage is used by many hedge funds, especially those using arbitrage strategies. Leverage can be achieved by borrowing to invest or by entering into a financial transaction where the fund only has to come up with, say, 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the underlying exposure as a margin or deposit.
Hedge fund strategies -
- Arbitrage is taking advantage of small discrepancies in the prices of the same financial instrument or similar securities by simultaneously selling the overpriced security and buying the underpriced security.
- Long/short strategy (relative value) involves buying one type of financial instrument long and selling another instrument short to exploit pricing anomalies between related (but not identical) assets that are mispriced relative to each other.
- Market neutral strategies are those that provide a return regardless of the overall market movement because the short position exposure is as great as the long position.
- Fixed income relative value/Fixed income arbitrage evolved from classical arbitrage, but instead of identical securities the two securities bought and sold are merely similar.
- Convertible bond (warrant) arbitrage. This is taking a long position in convertible bonds or warrants while hedging with a short position, typically by shorting shares in the same company.
Event driven strategies take advantage of special situations. For example, distressed securities investing is when hedge fund managers buy shares or debt belonging to companies which are experiencing serious financial problems and could be facing bankruptcy.
- Merger arbitrage: funds take a long position in the target and a short position in the acquirer.
- Activist strategy: the hedge fund buys a portion of the shares in a company and uses the ownership to press for improvement in returns to shareholders.
- Global macro. Funds profit (and lose) from bets taken against countries, currencies, global economic dislocations in interest rates and other macroeconomic variables.
- Fundamental growth: investing in companies funds consider to have more earnings growth and capital appreciation potential than the average company.
- Fundamental value: investing in undervalued companies currently out of favour with most investors.
- Multi strategy: funds use the same pool of investment to invest in different strategies.

Prime brokers facilitate financial transactions for hedge fund managers including lending and custody.

Private equity provides medium to long-term finance for unquoted companies.

- Venture capital often refers to investment in start-up or young companies.
Private equity funds invest in a diverse group of companies.
- General partners carry out the administration of funds. GPs' aim is to find a company suitable for investment, and eventually make a profitable sale. They earn fees which pay all administration costs, and if the venture is successful a share in the eventual gain (carried interest), usually 20 per cent of the gain made.
- Limited partners are the individuals and institutions which invest in the funds.
Financing gap occurs in established businesses not ready to float, but unable to raise more shareholder funds.
- Business angels/informal venture capitalists - wealthy individuals willing to invest their own money and often experience and time. Average investment: £25,000 to £30,000.
Angel networks enable entrepreneurs to try to attract investment from members of clubs of business angels. A member of the network needs substantial assets, perhaps £250,000, or to earn £100,000 p.a.
Angels generally like to play a significant role in strategy and management. Most take a seat on the board. They are patient investors willing to hold their investment for at least a five-year period.
- Private equity and venture capital investments are illiquid (not easily tradeable), and are last in the queue in the event of liquidation.
- Types of support are:
- seedcorn financing, to allow the development of a business concept;
- start-up finances further development and marketing of project;
- other early stage finances manufacturing and sales;
- expansion, more finance needed for growth;
- management buyout, an existing team takes over a business or section;
- management buy-in, an external group of managers takes over all or part of a company;
- leveraged buyout, is the buying out of a company using substantial amounts of borrowed funds;
- secondary purchase, a company backed by private equity is sold to another private equity fund;
- public-to-private, a company uses private equity finance to purchase its shares and returns to unquoted status.

Private equity categories are - business angels;

- venture capital; management buyouts, buy-ins and leveraged buyouts;
- listed private equity, which enables retail investors to invest and trade in private equity funds.
- private equity investment trusts (PEITs), stock market quoted investment trusts with a focus on investing their shareholders' money in more risky unquoted developing companies.
- public to private: a company quoted on a stock market returns to unquoted status.
- Venture Capital Trusts, investment vehicles with important tax breaks designed to encourage investment in small and fast-growing companies. VCTs are companies whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
- Enterprise Investment Scheme, a government initiative to encourage the flow of risk capital to smaller companies by offering investors who invest in them tax breaks.

Private equity providers are -

- independents: public or private companies, funds or trusts which have raised funding from more than one source;
- captives; funds managed on behalf of a parent institution;
- semi-captives, which manage funds on behalf of a parent and raise independent funds.
- Exit is where investors realise profits:
- repurchase: the company has prospered and repurchases its shares from the private equity fund.
- secondary/tertiary/quaternary buyouts: the company is sold on to another fund.
- trade sale: the company is sold or merged with another company.
- going public: the company is floated and its shares are sold on the stock market.
liquidation: the company fails.
