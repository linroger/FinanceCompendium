# Chapter 15: Regulation of the financial sector

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this chapter the reader should be able to:

■ discuss the market failings that lead to the need for financial industry regulation;

- weigh up the arguments for and against tighter regulation, explaining the dangers that come with extensive regulation;
■ outline the core elements of financial regulation; describe the UK regulatory system;
■ discuss the European Union financial regulatory structure and some attempts at global coordination.

Customers of financial services firms place a great deal of trust in the managers when they hand over their money or follow their advice. Naturally, in most cases clients do not understand in any great detail where their money goes. They accept a promise that it will be returned to them, or at least that, if it is put at risk in order to generate a return, the managers will be careful, thoughtful and skilled in applying their savings to investment.

The lack of customer control and lack of customer information once the money is handed over leaves investors, depositors, insurance purchasers, etc. exposed to a number of human failings. There is the danger of incompetence that either through ignorance or laziness financial service providers waste the client's money, possibly losing it all. There is also the danger of outright fraud and other criminal acts that siphon money from the innocent to the crooked.

The financial service industry recognised long ago that it is in its own best interest to establish minimum standards of behaviour. If the users of financial services fear that malpractice is prevalent they will not allow their funds to flow through the system and the financial sector will shrink. These minimum standards need some sort of enforcement mechanism beyond a gentleman's agreement that all participants will behave ethically. Crooks and incompetent would love to join an industry where the majority of providers act with probity, because they can free-ride on the industry's reputation. Thus we need regulation. This may be provided by the industry itself with the back-up of statutory laws or could be provided by the government in some form.

This chapter first explains why, despite its high cost, we have regulation, and then discusses the dangers that arise in a regulated system. The main tasks and activities required of regulators is outlined followed by an examination of one of the most sophisticated regulatory structures in the world, the UK's. We then look at the additional regulatory rules imposed at the European Union level and at the global level.

Some people draw a distinction between regulation and supervision:

Regulation The process of rule making and legislation creating the supervisory system. The rules may come from the laws of the land or from the stipulations of the regulatory agency.

Supervision Monitoring the position and behaviour of individual firms, and enforcing the regulations if required.

For our purposes we will assume that the word regulation covers supervision as well.

### Why regulate?

Financial regulation is expensive. It cost hundreds of millions, even billions, to pay for regulators to carry out their tasks in a modern economy. There are further billions to be paid by the banks, insurance companies and other financial service firms in compliance costs, i.e. putting in place systems and training to ensure that staff behave according to the rules. These additional costs are likely to be passed on to clients. Then there are the potential losses because new organisations that are keen to provide a financial service are put off entering the industry by the costs and time of obtaining a license from the regulator and the subsequent monitoring – perhaps society loses much innovatory and competitive fizz as a result. Exhibit 15.1 gives us some idea of the costs.

So, given the costs, a fundamental question is: why do we bother with regulation? This section presents some ideas to answer that question.

### Asymmetric information

Asymmetric information is one of the forms of market failure in financial services in which the market participants will drive the industry to a sub-optimal outcome if left to their own devices. The other two reasons for intervention, also forms of market failure – contagion and monopoly/ oligopoly – are discussed later.

By Brooke Masters in London

The US spends more than six times as much to supervise banks and other credit institutions as the European Union, research has found.

The various federal and state agencies that supervise banks in the US spent  \$4.4bn on 18,000 frontline employees in 2009-10, while the 27 EU nations spent\$ 2.2bn on 10,000 employees, according to analysis by the Oliver Wyman consultancy.

The US spend  $1m per $1bn of banking revenues, compared with 150,000 in the EU.

The costs cover day-to-day supervision of the system for safety and soundness as well as consumer protection and conduct issues.

There are several reasons for the differences. The US has many more very small banks and spends correspondingly more on them. It also has about 10,500 institutions to safeguard, while the EU has 6,500. The two spend roughly the same per bank, at 150,000.

The US also has more overlap between its state and federal agencies.

Asymmetric information occurs when one party in a negotiation or relationship is not in the same position as other parties, being ignorant of, or unable to observe, some information which is essential to the contracting and decision-making process.

Managers and other employees of financial service companies have an information set that is often superior to that of the clients. This can lead to exploitation; for example, buyers of a financial product are unable to assess the true risk and return. Thus a large part of regulation is about ensuring that consumers receive relevant information about products in an understandable way.

Asymmetric information manifests itself in a number of ways: reducing safety and soundness for the consumer or a financial market counterparty;

- producing conflicts of interest within financial service firms which can be deleterious to the interests of consumers or counterparties;
- facilitating bad behaviour such as fraud;
- hiding and tolerating incompetence.

We will now look at each of these in turn.

## Safety and soundness

Consumers are frequently unable to assess the safety and soundness of a financial institution or the products it provides. They simply do not have the time or the expertise to evaluate whether the organisation is taking too much risk with their money. An example here is the flood of money that went into Icelandic Banks in the mid-2000s. Large numbers of savers from all over Europe were attracted by the high interest rates offered on deposit accounts. Little did they know that the accumulated bank deposits were lent out to high risk ventures with only small amounts being retained as a safety buffer. The managers of these banks were tempted by the higher interest rates they could charge on the more risky lending, producing large short term (apparent) profits and therefore large bonuses. Regulators are supposed to conduct prudential bank regulation (discussed in Chapters 2 and 7) to protect consumers from unsound bank policies and actions. They clearly failed in the case of the Icelandic banks, so after their collapse the authorities (governments in this case) were forced to guarantee all deposits, which is an expensive way to protect depositors. They are now much keener on ensuring banks are managed for safety and soundness.

A large part of the bank regulator's role is to ensure that banks have enough capital buffer (surplus of assets over liabilities) to be able to cover their obligations, even allowing for a large potential diminution of asset value due to, say, loan defaults. They are also concerned that a bank keeps back a sizeable amount of cash and other liquid resources to be able to meet short-term liquidity outflows. Capital reserves and liquidity reserves were discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 7 and so, despite this being a very important element in financial regulation, we will not discuss it any further here. Another element of safety and soundness for banks is that they do not have too many eggs in one (or a few) basket, say an excessive proportion of lending to one sector (e.g. property developers) – called concentration risk.

Buyers of insurance are usually unable to assess the likelihood of the insurance company becoming insolvent, and therefore unable to meet obligations to policy holders. The soundness of insurance firms is of great importance, not only to those with car and house insurance but also to the tens of millions of people who now save vast amounts through insurance products, from endowment mortgages and insurance bonds to personal pensions and retirement annuities.

Other questions in this area are: How sound is the stock broker who holds your shares in one of its accounts? How safely managed is your company pension fund, or your investment trust, or unit trust? Is your venture capital trust money being applied recklessly to absurdly risky ventures without adequate diversification?

Safety and soundness concerns arise not only in the relationship between financial service providers and consumers but also in the trading that takes place between financial intermediaries, for example, interbank lending and borrowing, trading in the foreign exchange market or derivatives trading all involve a degree of counterparty risk.

## Conflicts of interest

Conflicts of interest arise when a person or institution has a number of objectives (interests) and is free to choose which receives the most emphasis, when one of them might have the potential to corrupt the motivation to act. The choice made may not be one that would suit the consumer because it might be tainted by the self-interest of the financial service provider. But the consumer is unable to see the extent of the bias due to asymmetric information. Take, for example, an independent financial advisor who is supposed to advise a client on the best home for their savings but who is tempted by the large commission paid by a unit trust company to push the client into their product.

When conflict of interest scandals come to light it diminishes the trust that potential investors have in the system. And so the financial markets do not channel as much saving into productive investment opportunities as they would in the absence of conflicted objectives. Thus, society as well as investors lose because of the reduced flow and increased cost of funds. Regulation that provides reassurance that conflicts of interest are minimised can thus add to the wealth of society.

Conflicts of interest can lead to the misuse of information, the providing of false information, the providing of biased or selective information, or the concealing of information.

- Misuse An example of the misuse of information is spinning by an investment bank organising an initial public offering of a company's shares that it thinks will rise substantially. It allocates blocks of shares to a few select clients such as directors of companies that may give the bank a mandate to assist in raising capital (e.g. an IPO) in the future. These selected executives will make a killing in the week or two following the flotation. They will then repay the investment bank by directing their company to pay fat fees for a new bond or equity issue. This might be a lot more expensive for the company than if it shopped around for an arranger of funding. Thus the cost of capital raising is inflated and bankers take home large bonuses. Another example would be where an executive of a manufacturing firm is in possession of information that, when it is released to the market, will lead to a significant rise in the company's share price. In the meantime he buys shares in the firm expecting to profit from his insider knowledge.
- False An example of false information dissemination can arise when auditing firms also supply a client company with management consulting services (e.g. advice on tax, management systems, strategy). The latter services can result in fees that are many times what they receive from the audit. Client companies may pressure auditors by threatening to move their consulting custom to another firm if they do not see things their way. In accounting much judgement is required about issues such as the value of a non-current asset or the likelihood of a customer debt being paid. There is therefore wriggle-room for putting a positive gloss on profits and balance sheet strength. This can easily tip over into false information in the sense of, while being within the letter of the accounting rules, it breaks the spirit. A similar conflict was said to have occurred when credit rating agencies were accused of being too generous in rating the chance of default of bonds issued by many banks and special purpose vehicles set up to receive interest from US sub-prime mortgages in securitisation deals in the mid-2000s (see Chapter 6). The issuing company pays for the rating but the consumers of that information are the bond investors, hence the conflict of interest. The rating agencies were accused of trying to attract future rating mandates by being less than unbiased. They defended themselves vigorously saying that they cannot afford to be seen as anything other than impartial and objective if their ratings are to be taking seriously. They stand to lose their entire business franchise if they cannot be relied upon by bond buyers. Thus they have a high degree of self-policing. If bond-buyer faith in the rating agencies did ever seriously decline there would be a danger of a much reduced flow of funds to companies and therefore lower wealth in society. Exhibit 15.2 describes the consequences flowing from an analyst providing false information.
- Biased An example of biased information arises in a badly organised investment bank which while issuing research reports and advising investors on good bond purchases also arranges a bond issue by a client company. A great deal of effort goes into understanding the company when arranging a bond issue, and the information generated may be useful to the research team supplying analysis to investors. However, the issuing firm would like to sell the bonds at

## Analyst fined over misleading message

## By Brooke Masters

A former MF Global analyst has been fined  $50,000$  for sending clients and colleagues a "misleading and inaccurate" instant message that appeared to contain inside information about a UK-listed company.

The Financial Services Authority said trading in shares of Enterprise Inns more than trebled and the price rose more than 4 per cent in the two hours after Christopher Gower sent his message, entitled "Hot off the press" to 14 clients and a message group of 60 colleagues.

The case is the first FSA enforcement action to stem from an instant message and reflects growing concern among regulators about rumour-mongering and loose treatment of potential inside information by financial professionals.

Margaret Cole, FSA head of enforcement, said: "There is no excuse for a senior retail analyst to be so careless with messages that could have such an impact on the market. Gower's dissemination of inaccurate information contributed to a large increase in the volume of shares traded and a disorderly market in ETI shares."

Mr Gower's solicitor declined to comment, as did MF Global.

The FSA said Mr Gower's message on May 7 2008, which cited a meeting he had with the chief executive of Punch Taverns, gave the impression inaccurately he was passing on inside information about Enterprise's efforts to win permission to convert to a real estate investment trust.

But the regulator stopped short of charging Mr Gower with market abuse, saying that his conduct was "careless" and failed to meet market standards.

Angele Hayes, partner at Mayer Brown, the law firm, said: "This case emphasises the scrupulous care analysts need to take when they make informal communications about companies they are following… [and] shows that the 'broker's banter' defence will not assist if analysts are caught gilding the lily."

The FSA brought a similar case in 2006 against Sean Pignatelli, a

Credit Suisse equity salesman. He was fined  $20,000$  for passing on what appeared to be inside information about US-listed Boston Scientific.

In 2008, the regulator warned in a newsletter that it was concerned about the spread of rumours and urged regulated firms to set out their policies about passing on information and do more training of their staff. It warned last year about leaks.

US regulators are also cracking down on rumours. The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008 charged a Wall Street trader with spreading false stories about a company that he was selling short.

Paul Glass, a lawyer with Taylor Wessing, said: "This case is a reminder that the FSA isn't just interested in insider dealing… Any disclosure of misleading information by an approved person which affects the market is likely to be investigated."

as high a price as possible and so would like the researchers to be optimistic. If the fee received for organising the bond is sufficiently large then the investment bank may (if not properly controlled) select the information it releases to boost the potential sales level. These banks are supposed to have high 'Chinese walls' separating different departments to prevent these conflicts of interest, but it is surprising how positive many of them are about the equity or debt securities of their client companies (it is difficult to find negative comment).

- Concealment An example of the concealment of information is when a bank has a loan outstanding to a company that it suspects is running into serious financial difficulties. Bank officers have access to this information but the bond issue department is nevertheless encouraged to sell bonds in the company without telling investors about the company's likelihood of distress. The loan is paid off and the bank earns a fee for selling the bonds.

Many conflicts of interest are not exploited even in the absence of regulation because the incentive to do so is not sufficiently high. Also, financial firms often live and die by their reputations. Any conflict that became visible would be punished as other financial organisations and clients shunned the firm. Having said that, we still need regulation because these constraints may not work on particular individuals with immediate bonuses to puff-up, or when the firm itself is excessively focused on short-term profits rather than long-term reputation.

# Fraud

Financial markets present opportunities to make large profits over short periods of time; this is especially the case if a trusted professional lacks moral fibre. While the majority of people in the financial sector are honourable and of high integrity, such a honey pot is bound to attract greedy knaves who are clever enough to dream up a range of chicanery.

## Incompetence

Consumers often receive poor service due to incompetence. This may be bad advice because of the inattention or ignorance of a financial adviser – see Exhibit 15.3 for an example. There may be incompetence in managing a client's funds or their business interests. In financial services incompetence can continue undetected for years. For example, in the handling of pension fund money, the manager will render the service of investing to supply pensions decades after the savers have injected funds into the scheme. It may only be after retirement that it is revealed whether it will meet the financial needs of the retirees.

### Exhibit 15.3

### Barclays hit with record fine

By Brooke Masters and Sharlene Goff in London

Barclay will pay a record  $\mathbb{S}7.7\mathrm{m}$  fine and up to  $\S 59\mathrm{m}$  in compensation for failing to provide adequate investment advice to more than 12,000 of its customers, many of whom were retirees who suffered losses in the financial crisis.

The fine is the largest imposed by the Financial Services Authority for a case involving retail investors and the sixth largest in the regulators history.

The FSA said Barclays had failed to ensure that two Aviva funds were suitable for clients who invested nearly  $700\mathrm{m}$  in them between 2006 and 2008. Many were seeking additional income and Barclays staff failed adequately to explain the risks involved, the regulator said.

More than 1,700 of the investors in Aviva's Global Balanced Income Fund and the Global Cautious Income Fund have already complained and received  $17\mathrm{m}$  in compensation. The FSA said Barclays may have to pay up to  $\S 42\mathrm{m}$  more.

The bank plans to write to all clients who have not already com plained and compensate them for their losses. "We are serious in our apologies to these customers. This is not something we want to ever happen again," said Paul McNamara, Barclays managing director of insurance and investments.

The FSA said Barclays also failed promptly to rectify the situation after it identified unsuitable sales in 2008. "Thousands of investors, many of whom were seeking to invest their retirement savings, have suffered… Given Barclays' position as one of the UK's major

# Exhibit 15.3 continued retail banks we view these breaches as particularly serious and fully deserving of what is a very substantial fine," said Margaret Cole, FSA enforcement director.

Aviva was urged to improve its documentation but is not facing an enforcement case, people familiar with the issue said.

Consumer groups said tougher enforcement was needed. "This is yet another example of banks giving poor financial advice to their customers," said Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of Which?, the consumer organisation. "We believe the fine imposed by the FSA is far too lenient. If we're going to deter financial institutions from failing their customers, then fines need to be much higher."

The financial crisis has led regulators around the world to focus more closely on whether retail investors are being sold suitable products and adequately warned about risks.

## Contagion

In some financial sectors, say banking, the failure of a company may lead to the failure of others leading to instability in the whole system. This is called contagion risk. As we have seen following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 contagion can have very serious consequences for the economic health of a nation as well as for consumers of financial products. If a domino effect takes hold, where one bank's failure (or perceived likely failure) to meet its obligations to other banks or clients, leads to more bank collapses and further losses it can ruin the entire system, possibly taking us down into a 1930s-style depression. Economists would describe this as an example of an 'externality' in which the social cost of failure exceeds the private cost.

The damage caused by spreading contagion is so bad that it is well worth the effort to ensure individual banks are unlikely to collapse by regulating the amount of capital and liquid assets they hold. It is also worth insisting that they write and continuously update 'living wills' so that they can be revived or closed down in an orderly way without fatally wounding other banks should they run into trouble. (Living wills are discussed in Chapter 7.) It is also advisable to insist that none is either too big to fail (i.e. the government cannot contemplate letting it go into bankruptcy) or 'too big to save', where no government can raise enough money to save it. Exhibit 15.4 describes the US regulator's tightening of scrutiny to reduce contagion risk, which stretches to insurers and hedge funds.

### Exhibit 15.4

### Regulators increase scrutiny of US banks

By Francesco Guerrera in New York

US regulators have increased their scrutiny of the country's largest banks in recent months, digging deeper into riskier activities and pushing institutions to conduct more rigorous "stress tests" of their financial health.

Wall Street executives say that since the end of the financial crisis examiners from the Federal Reserve, the main banking watchdog, have become tougher and more detailed in their policing of large financial institutions.

"They are all over us," said a senior Wall Street banker. "They want to see a lot more detail and are demanding a lot more information."

The tighter oversight is part of the authorities' effort to reduce the chances of another financial crisis as devastating as the last one by closing regulatory gaps that allowed banks to take on huge risks and unsustainable amounts of debt.

The overhaul of US financial rules that became law last month gives the Fed sweeping powers to oversee a wide range of companies - from banks to insurers and hedge funds - whose failure would endanger the financial system.

Regulators such as the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been criticised for failing to curtail the excesses that led to the implosions of Lehman Brothers, AIG and Bear Stearns and forced the government to inject funds into Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America.

The New York Fed, which oversees most large financial groups, declined to comment on its scrutiny but executives said the tougher policing centred on the severity of internal stress tests and more detailed probes of banks' profits.

Federal examiners have asked banks for more details on the profitability of different businesses, such as trading, capital markets and investment banking, rather than focusing on group-wide balance sheets as in the past, bankers said.

Corporate executives often complain about the costs and complexity of regulations but several top bankers said that the post-cri sis changes have been among the toughest in recent times.

The deeper analysis indicates authorities now recognise that before the crisis rising bank profits were often coupled with an increase in hidden risks. For example, regulators paid little attention to the increase in the amount of mortgage-backed securities on banks' books partly because their performance was good and their risks were not clearly visible on balance sheets.

Bankers say regulators are also putting pressure on them to be more pessimistic in stress tests aimed at measuring banks' ability to respond to economic shocks.

Institutions had been taking the collapse in housing prices and the economic slow-down of the recent crisis as their most extreme case but the authorities wanted them to use even more dramatic assumptions, they added.

Stricter oversight in the US is part of an overhaul of global financial rules that could force institutions to significantly alter their business models. The Fed's new stand is similar to the approach adopted by the UK's Financial Services Authority.

## Monopoly/oligopoly

Many markets will, if left to their own devices, tend towards a structure where one or a few firms exert undue market power over product pricing. Consumers need protection against monopolistic/oligopolistic exploitation.

There are many forces encouraging movement towards monopoly in financial services apart from the desire to control prices. Economies of scale are such that it makes sense for many banks and other institutions to become very large. Banks with branches in every town and with capabilities to serve multinational firms in every country have an advantage in attracting customers. With stock exchanges, liquidity in share trading may be lowered if there is more than one national exchange. There are also network effects: a single payments system linking the major banks makes more sense than a number of competing systems because each participant needs to make as many connections within the network as possible.

Where natural monopoly makes sense there is even more need to regulate to avoid abuse by over-charging. Where the benefit of lowering the cost of production by reducing the industry structure to a single firm or a handful of suppliers is roughly balanced by the social loss from ceding pricing power to the producers, there is a case for regulators to insist on a certain minimum number of players or maximum market shares for any one provider.

## The dangers to watch out for in a regulatory system

## Moral hazard

The mere presence of regulation can cause moral hazard, which is:

The presence of a safety net encourages adverse behaviour (e.g. carelessness).

Thus regulation can be counterproductive, in that, if consumers believe that they will be bailed out by the government if thing go wrong they will be tempted to take higher risk. Why not place your money in a deposit account offering an unrealistically high interest rate? The bank may go bust but your deposit is safe. Why not pay into a savings scheme offered by an insurance company offering a guarantee of doubling your money over four years? If the company fails you can insist on the government/regulatory fund making good on the promise. In this way irresponsible, badly managed and crooked banks and other financial institutions survive, drawing society's scarce resources away from more productive investment.

## Agency capture

Agency capture occurs when those that are supposed to be regulated take some control of the regulatory process. Then the regulation is modified to suit the interests of the producers rather than the consumers. For example, under Basel II (see Chapter 7) the large banks managed to persuade the regulators that it would be sensible for capital requirements to be set in the mould of the banks' own internal risk models. Many people say that the banks were too influential in lowering capital limits, manipulating the rules on risk-weighting assets and in using their own models. This helped to precipitate the 2008 crisis as banks were found to have taken too much risk.

The regulated firms usually have far more financial interest in the activities of regulators than consumers; and so they apply themselves to persuading their overseers to relax their constraints. In many cases the people working in the regulatory organisation are paid significantly less than the financial service high flyers, and they can sometimes be intimidated or outsmarted. Furthermore, many of the more senior regulators have come from the industry they are now regulating and therefore share many of their attitudes and values. Also, they may expect to return to work in the industry following their stint as policemen; they may thus avoid offending potential future employers.

## Excessive compliance cost

The cost to regulated firms of adhering to the rules will usually result in raised fees, lower return or some other penalty for consumers because the institution is likely to pass the additional burden through to clients.

## Stifling innovation and growth

The requirements to be licensed and the additional costs of subsequent compliance can impose such a bureaucratic load that few or no firms dare to enter the industry. Thus, inefficient monopolies are sustained and oligopolies with implicit cartel-type arrangements persist in over-charging consumers because they are not challenged by new entrants.

The poor level of innovation and competition in Indian's banking system is of great concern to the government that has for so long promoted state-owned banks as the way forward - see Exhibit 15.5. But India has to be careful about allowing industrial conglomerates to take control of banks and then use the money within for their own purposes.

### RBI set to decide on shape of banking

# James Lamont

The Reserve Bank of India is on the cusp of a critical decision about the future of Indian Banking.

Guidelines expected to be published by the end of this month will indicate whether big corporations can snap up highly desirable new banking licences on offer as India seeks to modernise its financial system.

After five months of consultation, central bank officials say opinion is divided over whether big corporations, such as Reliance Industries, the Tata Group or Bharti, should be permitted to own banks, as well as how much the initial capitalisation of a new bank should be. The RBI must also decide how many licences to issue and whether to offer them in waves or in a single tranche. The issuing of new banking licences, proposed last year by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, could serve

a big political goal of greater financial inclusion among India's 1.2bn people, most of whom have no access to formal banking. It could also help in loosening the state's grip on the financial sector.

Alongside the RBI's deliberations, India's largely state-owned banking sector has a deadline of end-March to detail how it intends to make services available to more people. The RBI has directed that within five years the banking system must be extended to India's "villages", or centres with populations of more than 2,000 people.

A profitable business model for bringing banking to India's millions remains elusive, and potentially politically explosive.

Microfinance companies have hit hurdles in a country mistrustful of profiting off the poor. Proponents of "financial inclusion" are putting great store in technological advances expanding financial services, but regulators and bankers acknowledge there is no simple solution, in spite of India's expertise in IT and investment in technology.

The central bank is eyeing the ingenuity of India's most successful business leaders to tap the country's large savings pool.

Margins in financial services in India are high and competition gentle, leaving wide opportunity for competitive private provision - as show by ICICI Bank, India's biggest private bank with assets of 81bn and a major provider of unsecured personal loans. Some new private sector banks have proved an overnight success, quickly gaining a reputation for innovation and eyecatching branding.

Yes Bank, launched just six years ago by former Rabo India head, Rana Kapoor, has a capitalisation of 12bn. But its success has been to target the corporate sector and wealthy individuals in advance of the wider, costlier retail deposit market. Its rise has fuelled wider corporate interest in banking licences, but is also causing a dilemma for the RBI. Regulators must ensure new entities fulfil a social mandate of providing services to the poorer market rather than mining the profits of niche markets.

The RBI is likely to attach social provisions to banking licences, something it did not do in the last round awarded. Given the financial rewards and value a banking licence brings, some companies have already expressed interest. Larsen

& Toubro, India's largest engineering and construction company, is eyeing a banking licence for subsidiary L&T Finance, which specialises in infrastructure finance.

Yet a concentration of financial resources among business houses risks unhealthy cross-subsidisation of financial and industrial operations, with a threat to transparency.

Wary of volatility, the RBI has already ruled out real estate companies diversifying into banking. Within 20 years, Indian officials expect the banking system to be much more dynamic. They foresee banks being able to offer low-income households credit and micro insurance in addition to simpler savings and remittances products, and the emergence of global Indian banks.

The guidelines will determine whether a new generation of tycoon-led banks is among them.

The City watchdog is now taking three times as long to approve new financial businesses as it did before the crisis, raising new concerns over damage to London's standing as an international financial centre.

Entrepreneurs seeking to set up new financial services businesses such as banks, brokerages or hedge funds must now wait almost three months on average for a decision from the Financial Services Authority.

The steep rise in registration time - up from just seven weeks at the beginning of 2007 - comes in spite of a fall in the number of companies applying for permission to trade, down from a peak of nearly 2,200 in the 2006-07 financial year to just over 1,500 in the 12 months to April this year.

The FSA says that the extended registration process is a reflection of heightened diligence in response to the financial crisis, but critics warn that it could become a drag on London's international position.

"These delays risk reducing competition and harming the City's international competitiveness," said Jonathan Davies, a partner at London law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain.

The FSA said the increased registration times were the result of changes implemented by the regulator to ensure a more thorough and rigorous vetting process.

# Exhibit 15.6 continued

In particular, the watchdog had increased its scrutiny of individuals seeking to set up or run new businesses.

The FSA now interviews every individual - including directors, nonexecutive directors, executives and partners - who may exercise a "significant influence function" in a new business. According to people familiar with the process, those individuals are also now subject to detailed background checks, including checks for criminal records. An FSA insider described the approach as "intensive and intrusive supervision".

It is understood that a greater number of cases than ever before are being referred to a special internal tribunal set up by the regulator to vet and advise on the suitability of individuals to work in the financial services sector.

While stricter oversight of the City has been broadly welcomed in many quarters, including many large city institutions, smaller financial services businesses claim they are being unfairly penalised by the stricter regime.

"I understand the principle of it all, but it's misdirected," said one fund manager who has recently set up a new London-based hedge fund.

"It has taken us literally months to jump through various hoops and try and get off the ground - none of which is beneficial to our investors, who are the ones that really scrutinise us."

Hedge fund managers typically run on very tight margins to begin with and can struggle to afford costs such as full-time compliance officers or lawyers. Incidences of fraud or market abuse by London-based hedge funds have been few and far between, the industry points out.

The added regulator burden, they say, is one of a growing number of factors leading many to consider starting up new businesses abroad or redomiciling to locations such as Geneva or the Channel Islands.

## Types of regulation

A key question, once you have accepted the need for regulation, is: who should carry out the task? We have three possibilities: the industry itself, government or a government agency.

## By the industry itself

Self-regulation has a number of advantages. The people within the industry have a clear need to preserve its high reputation. If the public image of a sector of financial services is badly damaged then confidence can evaporate along with the desire to place money in the hands of those in that industry. Not only does it become embarrassing to admit that you are member of that tainted service sector at dinner parties (just ask investment bankers!) but jobs might be lost in their thousands.

A further advantage of self-regulation is that the people most knowledgeable about the industry are those working in it. They know all the tricks being played and can quickly adapt the rules to deal with any new tricks. They also know the most efficient ways of running a decent industry and so can avoid regulatory overkill, such as unreasonable high safety standards or excessive compliance costs. In other words, self-regulation is usually 'lighter' than regulation by a government-imposed body.

Even self-regulation requires the back-up of legislation to ensure, say, minimum standards to be able to join the industry and then to insist that participants abide by the rules. Without this insistence, free-riders will enter to enjoy the raised reputation of the industry with consumers, without having to pay the costs of compliance or suffer the constraints.

The arguments against self-regulation include the suspicion that the institutions will be continuously tempted to slacken the rules. Second, power to permit industry entry is put in the hands of the existing players, who might be tempted to put up barriers to discourage new firms from entering the industry. A third problem is that it is difficult to regulate a firm that has activities in many different financial service industries. For example, conglomerate banks also offer investment products and insurance services, pension funds and investment advice. Unless the self-regulatory body's remit is very widely defined, misdemeanours, bad practice and fraud can seep in through the cracks between the regulators.

Self-regulatory organisations are usually dependent on funding from the industry itself to function, which could encourage it to be more favourably disposed towards the producer rather than the consumer.

## By the government

There are many cases where self-regulation is clearly not sufficient to maintain the integrity of the financial system and so governments are compelled to intervene by providing a regulatory structure. However, there is a danger here. Governments realise that they will be criticised if there is a financial scandal but will not receive much praise if a series of scandals is avoided. They can therefore have a tendency to err on the side of heavy regulation to reduce even small risks of failure. This will raise the cost to producers and consumers unreasonably. Also governments tend to be less agile than industry self-regulators in responding to new developments and tricks of the morally challenged.

## By a government agency

This is designed to capture the best elements of the other two options. An organisation is established by the government, but the government does not control its day-to-day activities, nor intervene in its decisions. Instead of government bureaucrats the agency is run by a group of experts with longstanding industry experience. The government establishes the guiding principles and goals but then stands back to avoid being tempted to meddle because of some political motivation. The government may, however, provide legislative back-up to ensure that the agency has strong powers, e.g. the right to prosecute insider dealers in a criminal court or the right to fine firms caught disobeying the rules.

Using respected industry veterans to run the agency engenders greater practitioner respect for it than would be the case if government officers were in charge. This allows a lighter touch where the key focus is on following the spirit of the rules rather than the letter of the law. This approach requires subtlety that civil servants may lack. Also, poachers turned game-keepers are likely to be more alert and agile in keeping up with the latest tricks on the financial streets.

Even though former practitioners are in charge, they have a statutory framework that prevents them from slackening the rules, or unreasonably restricting entry of new firms to a financial service. Also, the regulator can be given the powers to examine a full range of financial services and markets and so can avoid the problem of some activities falling between the cracks of an industry by industry regulatory structure.

On the downside, the agency route can be a lot more expensive than self-regulation by the industry.

## International competitiveness

Prior to the 2008 financial crisis there was much comment among those informed about financial matters concerning the problem of competitive laxity in regulation. That is, financial centres that try to impose strict rules find that financial institutions respond not by tightening their systems and raising probity, but by moving operations to a different jurisdiction, where the rules are looser. This sort of regulatory arbitrage is still very much on the minds of regulators and politicians today as they try to make the systems in their countries more robust. As soon as they announce that they will impose an extra rule to make things fairer and safer the cry goes up from the banks and others that they will lose out to overseas competitors who do not have to obey that rule. Furthermore, given that they will be at a competitive disadvantage, they, too, might have to move abroad. The danger is that the regulators and politicians around the globe each back down in turn in the face of this pressure.

One solution is to stand up to the banks, etc. and say, 'If you want to do very risky things or unfair things then we would prefer it if you did go somewhere else, so we are going to impose the rule ourselves even if no other country does the same' – this is termed the unilateral approach. A difficulty arises when the proposed curtailment is borderline in terms of fairness and risk – then you might lose thousands of jobs in financial services for little gain. Of course, the authorities would like to achieve international agreement (multilateral approach) so that all the financial centres impose the same rule to avoid regulatory arbitrage (as with Basel III), but this is difficult to attain.

Exhibit 15.7 describes the shift to de-emphasise the UK regulator's role as a champion of the City, and a greater emphasis on prudential regulation. Exhibit 15.8 is a letter published in the  $FT$  from experienced practitioners who are fully aware of the importance of fair dealing and ethical behaviour to sustain a financial centre. Exhibit 15.9 sums up the core elements of regulation. See also Exhibits 15.10 - 15.12.

### Exhibit 15.7

### Regulator to soften focus on keeping City's edge

FT

By Paul J Davies and Brooke Masters

The City regulator will put less emphasis on maintaining London's competitiveness in relation to other financial centres, its head said yesterday, in a striking acknowledgement that the approach had undermined the stability of the financial system.

Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said that prudential regulation of institutions and the financial system had suffered as regulators in many countries had in the past put too much focus on the attractiveness to the financial industry of their home markets.

"What we have just been through shows that getting it wrong in a prudential sense was so costly economically that you would have to believe the competitive advantage was extremely strong for it to have been worth it," Lord Turner said.

"We are interested in competitive markets rather than competitiveness."

The comments were made as Lord Turner answered questions after a speech at the biennial gathering of the Association of British Insurers in London.

The ABI has called on the regulator and government to strive to maintain the UK's competitiveness in its response to the financial crisis. "Over-regulation drives out capital, so consumers suffer high prices and, in the case of insurers, more risk falls on customers," it said in its recent response to the Turner Review of financial regulation.

Lord Turner did offer some succour to insurers, saying that while a regulatory revolution was needed in banking, insurance regulation faced no equivalent need.

But Lord Turner's remarks are sure to spark anxiety in the City, particularly in the banking and alternative investment sectors, where many participants fear that new regulation will increase costs and cut into profits.

Several prominent UK hedge funds warned the Treasury last week that they were prepared to move to Switzerland unless a proposed European Union directive on alternative investments was radically changed.

George Osborne, shadow chancellor, speaking at the ABI earlier in the day, had called for the public authorities to ensure they did not "needlessly undermine London's competitive advantage" with "badly designed new regulation and uncompetitive tax rates".

### Exhibit 15.8

### Bringing back the City's rock-solid reputation

From Sir John Craven, Mr Rupert Hambro and others

FT

Sir, The undersigned, among many others, were deeply involved in the creation of what is today the world's largest capital market: the Euromarket.

This market originated in the US, the Continent, and then in London in the late 1960s, where it became firmly anchored - and now flourishes with volumes undreamt of at the time. There are many reasons why it concentrated in London: the City's history, law, language, skill sets and supporting services. But a major factor was the City's international reputation for fair dealing

and ethical behaviour. This was important because, at the time, the Euromarket was unregulated and over-the-counter, involving global counterparties, large and small. Trust was paramount.

It is difficult to deny that, in recent years, behaviour in the whole sale financial services industry has resulted in a severe loss of trust. There are many reasons for this: consolidation, different career aspirations and general cultural changes are but a few. Regulation has become more prescriptive in response to the explosion in City volumes in recent years, as a result of which the letter of the law has become paramount, while its spirit has been smothered almost to extinction.

This deterioration has an impact not only on the City's international standing, but on domestic perceptions as well. The legitimate discussion on compensation practices might be less heated if the City's reputation for ethical business conduct were rock solid.

The trend towards more complex regulation is irreversible. But the trend away from the highest standards of business practice need not be. The wholesale financial services industry still attracts new talent, if in smaller numbers in the present crisis. Those responsible for inducting and mentoring new recruits should remind them that the City's reputation for fair dealing played a critical role in attracting business to London, and can do so again, in a world where competition between financial centres is even greater than it was it was when we began.

## Regulation of UK financial services

Now that we have covered the basic principles lying behind regulation we will look at the example of the UK to illustrate the range of responsibilities typically given to regulators.

Interestingly, the UK regulatory system is going through something of an upheaval at the time of writing. For more than a decade the Financial Services Authority has dominated the scene. It is a 'super-regulator' with oversight of an amazing range of financial sectors. This is in contrast to some systems (e.g. the US) where there are a dozen or more regulators, each looking after one or a limited range of types of financial service.

In 2013 the FSA will split in two. The main body, the Financial Conduct Authority will still be a super-regulator covering a very wide range of financial services – see Exhibit 15.13. One important function, that of the individual regulation of the 2,200 biggest banks, insurers and brokers on the issue of safety and soundness (micro-prudential supervision), will be transferred to the new Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), a subsidiary of the Bank of England. It will be responsible for granting permission for their activities and approving their senior management. It will have the powers to impose additional capital requirements, limit leverage and change the risk weighting of assets in order to reduce the risk of failure. It is expected that it will be staffed by old FSA hands and will be headed by Hector Sants, the current FSA chief executive.

The Bank of England previously had the responsibility together with the FSA and the Treasury of ensuring the systemic safety of the banking system; that is, setting rules on capital and liquidity reserves for banks across the sector as a whole and imposing other rules to reduce contagion risk. Following the 2008 financial crisis it was thought wise to concentrate this macro-prudential regulation in the hands of one regulator together with the micro-prudential regulation of individual banks (and other finance businesses), rather than have the 'triplite' approach where people in the Bank of England, Treasury and the FSA are not quite clear which of them should be taking charge when a systemic threat arises – as was the case up to 2008. The additional consideration is that these systemically important institutions might need access to central bank funding in an emergency and so it is best if they are regulated by the Bank.

### Exhibit 15.9 The core elements of regulation

## Licensing

Is a person fit and proper to manage a provider?

Only those who have met the standards required (integrity, honesty, capability) are allowed to provide a service in the industry.

Training schemes and qualifications are encouraged by regulators to raise standards

## Disclosure and monitoring

Disclosure of information about the operations of the financial firm and on-going monitoring may reveal whether a conflict of interest exists, whether risk management procedures are sound, whether the managers are competent and the institution is run with integrity.

This may involve off-site analysis of information provided and on-site inspections by the regulator

## Prudential limits

Examples:

Capital and liquidity requirements of banks and insurance firms.

Pension funds to have sufficient funds to meet commitments.

Whether securities firms are in a sound financial condition

## Fair trading on exchanges

A fair treatment of traders, particularly retail investors.

Prohibitions on insider dealing (using non-public information) – see Exhibit 15.10 for an example – and market manipulation or abuse (e.g. spreading false rumours) – see Exhibit 15.11.

Transparency of trading, e.g. open disclosure of price quotes by market makers.

Best execution provisions (see Chapter 8).

Prices of trades to be published.

Issuers of securities to provide prospectus and financial statements (see Chapter 9)

## Exposure limits e.g. no single borrower to account for more than  $10 \%$  of a bank's loans

## Penalties

In the event of non-compliance penalties may be imposed: e.g. fines, de-licensing, imprisonment, banning directors from the industry. For less serious offences a private warning or public censure may be sufficient

## Mandatory information provisions and consumer education

Customers should obtain the right information at the right time to help them make a decision.

Financial products/services to be clearly explained including risks, potential returns and costs such as charges. This must be presented in a consistent format to allow comparison.

Regulators often accept a responsibility to educate and foster financial literacy. This is to reduce the need for more heavy handed regulation

## Restricting activities

Prohibiting certain firms from a line of business or prohibiting a particular combination of financial services within the same organisation or a ban on anyone from engaging in the activity, e.g. no mortgage lending without proof of borrower's income.

Commercial companies are often not allowed to hold large equity stakes in a bank, and vice versa. Regulators may insist that financial service functions be separated. This may by splitting into in-house departments with

Chinese Walls between them. Or insisting on separately capitalised group companies or splitting up the company.

Anti-monopoly provisions restrict activity/prices

## Duty of care

Prescribing appropriate financial institution behaviour to avoid harm to customers.

No misrepresentation, fraud or mis-selling.

Knowing the financial position, investment goals, knowledge and experience of the customer before providing advice or selling a service to ensure that it is suitable, e.g. not selling a high risk investment to someone needing a low risk portfolio.

Eliminating unfair terms in contracts.

A firm must protect client assets while it holds them on behalf of the client - e.g. ringfencing them - see Exhibit 15.12

## Complaints handling and compensation

Put systems in place to assist consumers pursuing a complaint against a firm and to secure recompense.

Provide compensation if a firm is bust, e.g. bank deposit insurance

### China starts crackdown on insider trading

Jamil Anderlini

Market participants say the market is reacting to what appears to be the government's most serious campaign in years aimed at tackling rampant insider trading and stock manipulation.

The slide has coincided with a nationwide campaign, announced last week by the State Council, China's cabinet, to crack down on the "grim situation" of insider trading.

Mainland China's markets are notoriously opaque and speculative. Everyone, from small retail investors to top fund managers, appears to trade on tips from contacts who claim to have "inside" information.

"If you ask any Chinese investor whether they think a chairman or executive of a company is trading in their own stock, nine out of 10 would expect that to be the case just as they would expect a government official to be taking bribes," says Fraser Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism and other books on China's stock markets.

Last week's announcement marked the first time the Chinese cabinet has publicly addressed the issue of insider trading and was interpreted by investors as a signal of the government's determination to head off a new stock bubble.

Chinese investors and fund managers appear to be bracing themselves for the wave of prosecutions as the first casualties of this latest campaign begin to emerge.

Chinese media reports and market speculation claim that three top fund managers have already been investigated in the new crackdown.

All three individuals have denied they are the subject of any investigation, but two of them have resigned from their positions at leading Chinese investment funds.

Although, if true, this would be the most serious crackdown on insider trading in years, Beijing has a dismal record of catching people for a practice that everyone in the market says is rampant. In the past eight years, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has sent less than 90 cases of insider trading for criminal investigation and prosecution in Chinese courts.

And, in September this year, a real-estate company called Dragon

Wing Development became the first Chinese corporate entity convicted of insider trading since 1997.

Wu Jinglian, a Chinese government economist, recently described the country's stock market as being in the "age of robber barons" and pointed to insider trading by government officials as especially common.

In private, senior regulatory officials admit that government officials and their relatives are some of the worst offenders and the problem is serious even among those who are supposed to be policing the market.

Liu Jipeng, an economics professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, says that in China government officials have the power to influence even minor business decisions at listed companies, giving them enormous advantages over ordinary investors and a huge incentive to buy shares in anticipation of their own actions.

### FSA sinks talons into Eagle with £2.8m fine

By Brooke Masters

The Financial Services Authority has fined Simon Eagle, chief executive of defunct stock-broking group SP Bell,  $\S 2.8\mathrm{m}$  for share ramping - the largest financial penalty ever levied on an individual by the City regulator.

Mr Eagle was also banned from working in the financial services industry.

According to the FSA, Mr Eagle deliberately set out to push up the price of Fundamental-E Investments, an Aim-quoted company. He instructed SP Bell to sell the company's shares to their clients and rolled the purchases from account to account to create the impression of rising demand.

The share price rose from  $2^{1} / _{2}\mathrm{p}$  in May 2003 to  $11^{3} / _{4}\mathrm{p}$  in July 2004,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/d870b21e8b77091f03936673b26ff9f9b45e3e0af3cfdb9a03455e76a3785a08.jpg)

# Exhibit 5.11 continued earning Mr Eagle  $\S 1.2\mathrm{m}$  and enabling him to purchase 10 per cent of the company.

Mr Eagle, who represented himself and could not be reached for comment, paid disgorgement of  $1.3\mathrm{m}$  in profits and a penalty of  $\S 1.5\mathrm{m}$ .

Margaret Cole, FSA enforcement director, said: "This scheme was rotten throughout and at the core was Simon Eagle. He showed a breathtaking disregard for his clients, for his duty as an approved person and chief executive, and for the effect of his scheme on markets… This tough action shows that we are determined to keep dishonest cheats, like Simon Eagle, out of financial services."

Winterflood Securities, the marketmaker that put through Mr Eagle's manipulative trades, has already paid a  $4m$  penalty. The FSA found, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that the firm, part of Close Brothers, and its traders has committed unintentional market abuse by failing to stop suspicious trades.

Mr Eagle's case dates back to 2004, so it predates the FSA's recent efforts to bring criminal charges in serous market abuse cases. People familiar with the process said that if the investigation had started more recently, the regulator would probably have considered using its powers of prosecution.

Martyn Hopper, an attorney at Herbert Smith, called the fine a "significant result" for the FSA.

He said: "Market manipulation cases are much harder to prosecute than insider dealing because they are so complex. It's quite significant that the FSA has managed to get a result on one."

### Exhibit 15.12

### FSA fines two City brokers for not ringfencing clients' money

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/a11da77c410f6ed493590bd517af68d4e97a799585fcbd4a9133a225096e930f.jpg)

By Alistair Gray

The City watchdog flexed its muscles again yesterday when it punished divisions of Astaire Group and Close Brothers for failing to segregate clients' money from their own.

The Financial Services Authority said Rowan Dartington and Close Investments put investors at risk in breaches during the financial crisis and fined them  $\S 511,000$  and  $\S 98,000$  respectively.

The penalties came days after the FSA fined JPMorgan's securities arm a record  $33\mathrm{m}$  for similar problems. They form part of the wider investigation into how banks and brokers protect client money.

Margaret Cole, the FSA's enforcement director, said: "Firms should be in no doubt that if they fail to get their house in order in this regard we will take action against them."

Shares in Astaire were suspended eight weeks ago after the City stockbroker said  $\S 1.4\mathrm{m}$  went missing at Rowan Dartington, its wealth management arm.

The FSA said Rowan Dartington "could not rely on the accuracy of its internal books and records" after it failed to properly test and implement a new software system installed in May 2007.

Under FSA rules, banks, brokers and insurance companies are required to ringfence client money and keep it in separate accounts with trust status.

Of the  $\S 1.4\mathrm{m}$  missing money, more than  $\S 1\mathrm{m}$  remains unrecovered, Astaire added.

Meanwhile, Close Investments was fined for similarly failing to properly protect client money in the two years to January 2010.

No clients lost money as a result of the errors, both Close and Astaire said.

UK financial services industry regulation

Exhibit 15.13

The Financial Conduct Authority retains responsibility for protecting consumers and preserving market integrity, covering:

- investor protection, including that for bank customers;
- market supervision and regulation;
- business conduct of banks and financial services, including approval of consumer-related managers and the supervision of investment managers and other firms whose failure would be non-systemic (they would not cause a contagion);
- civil and criminal enforcement of market abuse rules;
- UK Listing Authority - supervision of initial public offerings and subsequent monitoring of listed companies (see Chapter 9).

While most companies will be answerable to only one regulator, the PRA-supervised firms will be under the supervision of two regulators. The FCA will cover the good treatment of customers and general business conduct while the PRA will cover safety and soundness of the institution.

The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, making decisions that apply to the entire sector to ensure systemwide financial stability including the avoidance of credit and asset bubbles, meets only four times a year to set rules. It might, for example, increase capital requirements above the Basel III minimum in normal times to ensure safety, and then lower them in a crisis so that the banks do not withdraw lending when the economy is already suffering. It may impose system-wide higher risk weights against specific classes of bank assets in markets that appear too exuberant. It may insist that banks increase their forward-looking loss provisioning when lending is growing fast. It might set nationwide borrowing limits such as maximum amount of a loan relative to the value of the property backing up that loan. The FPC has also been set the task of identifying emerging threats to the system from the 'shadow banking sector' – this comprises a group of financial institutions that individually or collectively act like banks but are not as heavily regulated as banks. See later in the chapter for more on shadow banking.

The PRA division does the hard work of day-to-day handling of individual institutions to ensure firm level stability and soundness. Of course, the Bank also has the Monetary Policy Committee to set interest rates and adjust the money supply – see Chapter 7.

The FSA/FCA can be described as semi-detached from government: it is financed by the industries it regulates, but its powers come from legislation; it often consults the financial services companies before deciding on principles, rules and codes of conduct, but it has basic principles approved by the government and it is answerable to the Treasury, which appoints its board, and through them Parliament.

The FSA/FCA tries to achieve the following:

1 Maintaining confidence in the financial system.

2 Protecting consumers.

3 Reducing financial crime, such as money laundering, fraud and insider dealing.

4 Financial stability - contributing to the protection and enhancement of stability in the UK financial system.

5 Helping people to gain the knowledge, aptitude and skills to manage their financial affairs effectively by promoting public understanding of the financial system.

While pursuing these objectives the regulator makes it clear that it is not removing all risk for the investor. Investment risk is an inherent part of the system and those who take the benefits from an investment when everything goes right have to accept that from time to time investment losses will occur. Also, the complete absence of consequences for the client should a financial firm fail may encourage laziness in choosing a place for their money and other moral hazards, and so the FSA/FCA does not promise to rescue failed firms, nor guarantee all money deposited/invested with them (but see Financial Services Compensation Scheme later). The FSA/FCA also tries to maintain healthy competition by encouraging entry into the industry and trying to strike the right balance between the costs and benefits of tighter regulation.

The FSA/FCA also has powers over unregulated firms and persons regarding breaches of money laundering regulations and short selling. In addition, it has the power to prosecute unauthorised firms or persons carrying on regulated activities. Its market abuse powers are very strong - see Exhibit 15.14 for an example.

### Broker fined for 'market abuse' in FSA commodities crackdown

By Javier Blas

A commodities broker was fined for "market abuse" by the Financial Services Authority yesterday in the first such penalty and a sign that the regulator is starting to crack down on price manipulation in the London-based raw materials markets.

The FSA said it had fined Andrew Kerr, a former broker at Sucden Financial, £100,000 and banned him from working in the financial industry. Mr Kerr has agreed to settle the case.

The regulator said Mr Kerr "deliberately manipulated" the Liffe robusta coffee futures and options markets on August 15 2007 on behalf of a client, which it did not identify. It is unclear whether the FSA will take action against the client, but coffee market participants said it was likely to do so.

Mr Kerr organised a series of trades during a key period of the day, which serves to price options, to boost artificially the price of coffee futures, the FSA said. Mr Kerr moved the market to \$1,752 a tonne, up from about \$1,145. The "small size of the coffee futures market meant that it was particularly vulnerable to price manipulation," the FSA said.

"Mr Kerr's financial benefit from the market manipulation was limited to his commission," the regulator said. But it added he was "doubtless motivated" by a desire to attract further business. Brokers estimated the commission at as low as \$100 and no more than \$500.

The FSA/FCA has a budget of over £450 million per year and employs more than 3,000 well-paid staff. The amount each of the 29,000 regulated firms pays depends on its size and the type of business it undertakes. The minimum fee of £844 in 2011 was paid by 43 per cent of those businesses. The FSA/FCA also receives money from financial penalties imposed on errant firms (raising about 10–20 per cent of its budget). Exhibit 15.15 describes the anger felt by many in the financial service sector about the high level of charges. Solvency II is a strengthening in the capital reserves and risk management standards for all EU medium and large-sized life insurance companies. It is designed to reduce the chance of consumer loss or market disruption in insurance due to the firm experiencing a large decline in asset values (e.g. the share market declining by 40 per cent or more, or a large rise in bond defaults), say because of another financial shock like that in 2008.

### Insurance industry says watchdog's fees 'unjustified'

FT

By Paul J Davies

The insurance industry has attacked the higher fees being demanded by the City watchdog as "unjustified" and expressed concerns about "the lack of effective oversight" of how it sets its budget requirements.

The Financial Services Authority said its annual funding needs would rise 9.9 per cent to  $454.7\mathrm{m}$  when it issued its business plan for 2010-11 in mid March. Today is the deadline for industry responses to the plan.

The regulator said the rise in fees, which are paid by all regulated financial companies, reflected a tougher approach to supervision and enforcement in the wake of the crisis and the cost of preparing for European capital rules - known as Solvency II - that are being drawn up in Europe.

The Association of British Insurers, however, claimed that the latest increase on top of a 36 per cent rise last year would mean many insurers will have seen their fees double over the past three years.

"It is difficult to see the justification for these increases as insurers and insurance regulation were proven to be both strong and

# Exhibit 15.15 continued stable during the financial crisis said Peter Vipond, director of regulation and tax at the ABI.

"We are concerned about the lack of effective oversight [by government and parliament] of the way in which the FSA sets its budget requirements and charges levies to firms."

The FSA said much of the increase in its funding needs stemmed from the costs of Solvency II, which alone would cost  $100\mathrm{m - }150\mathrm{m}$  by the time it was implemented in 2012. The regulator plans to take on 460 more staff, or an extra 14 per cent.

The introduction of a single super-regulator for a country was unusual when in 2001 the FSA was given powers over several areas of financial services (it was set up in 1997 with a more limited remit). However, the advantages of a unified approach are well recognised today and many countries (e.g. Japan, Germany and Sweden) have a super-regulator for their financial sectors. Increasingly, financial institutions provide a wide range of services and so a unified approach to regulation is needed. This allows greater insight into the firm's practices and avoidance of the problem of financial activities falling between the cracks of separate regulator's responsibilities. Also, there are economies of scale in investigation and monitoring (having six different regulators visiting a firm and asking similar questions is clearly inefficient for the regulated and the regulator).

## Authorisation

All firms or individuals offering financial advice, products or services in the UK must be authorised by the FSA/FCA. Engaging in a regulated activity without authorisation can result in a two-year prison sentence. The FSA insists on high standards when assessing for authorisation. These require competence, financial soundness and fair treatment of customers. Firms are authorised to carry out specific activities, e.g. giving financial advice only, or managing a client's money in a fund, or stockbrokering.

## Monitoring

Even after initial approval, firms cannot relax as the FSA/FCA continues to monitor adequacy of management, financial resources and internal systems and controls. It also insists that any information provided to investors is clear, fair and not misleading. If firms fail to meet these standards they can be fined or even stopped from doing business. The FSA/FCA also works closely with the criminal authorities and uses civil and criminal powers. The following are some of the rules it enforces:

- Independent financial advisers have to ensure the product sold to an investor is suited to their needs – this requires knowledge of the consumer's personal and financial situation.
Insurance companies, especially those providing with-profits policies, endowments and other savings products, should have significantly more assets than they owe to customers under the policies they have sold them.
- Market 'abuse' is not allowed. For example, individuals are not allowed to trade on inside information or to manipulate share prices by, for example, providing misleading information to the market.
- There must be a clear separation of clients' money from the firms' money ('ring fencing').

The FSA/FCA cannot look in detail at each of the 29,000 companies it regulates on a routine basis because this would impose an excessive cost burden on the industry, so it uses a 'risk-based approach'. It has a process for categorising firms into risk classes based on the likely impact that a firm would have on consumers or the market if it was to breach the rules (e.g. number of consumers likely to be affected and the systemic threat) and on the probability of that particular problem occurring. Firms that pose little risk of operating against the objectives of the FSA/FCA, labelled 'low-impact firms', are allowed to submit basic information in regulatory reports twice a year. They do not have regular visits. This 'light touch' regulation applies to over 90 per cent of the firms under supervision. This allows the regulator to concentrate resources on activities and institutions that appear to pose the greatest risk to customers and markets.

For medium and high-impact firms a regular (on a cycle of 1–4 years) risk assessment is made. This is used to determine a risk mitigation programme proportionate to the risks identified. More work is put in by the regulator in investigating a firm if the firm is large or particularly risky. High-impact firms will be subject to 'close and continuous' work, resulting in a schedule of regular visits to senior managers and a detailed examination of the control functions the firm has in place.

Of course, any firm that seems to be operating outside the spirit of the rules will receive a lot more attention, even if it is normally classified as low-impact. As a first step it may be required to complete a questionnaire. It may then receive a number of visits, and ultimately be punished (or individuals punished) through, for example, being fined, losing authorisation to operate or being subject to legal action.

The FSA/FCA emphasises broad principles rather than its rules. The problem with a regulator sticking strictly to rules is that they can result in inflexibility – just 'ticking boxes' – rather than concentrating the minds of the regulated on the spirit underlying the rules. Also a rule-based approach can be less flexible when it comes to permitting innovation from existing or new firms. A principles-based approach has less prescription and allows the regulator to meet new situations (e.g. new tricks by those smart people in the City) by using some degree of judgement rather than being hidebound by rules. Lawyers will forever be finding loopholes in rules; they find that more difficult if the rules are set in a framework of general principles, when the principles have greater weight.

Following the financial crisis the FSA became much less 'light-touch' and much more intrusive - see Exhibit 15.16. There is a danger that London will lose the goodwill and openness that exists between the regulated and the regulator, and end up with a more antagonistic US-type of relationship where lawyers are to the fore.

### FSA's new approach ruffles feathers

City firms say the Financial Services Authority's new approach to regulation, which includes sitting in on bank board meetings and issuing bigger fines for misbehaviour, makes the agency more like the intrusive US Securities and Exchange Commission than the "light touch" policeman they had been used to.

Before the 2007 collapse of Northern Rock, FSA supervisors were best known for a cooperative approach that, at least in the minds of those being supervised, emphasised box-ticking over deep understanding.

The relationship teams that interacted with banks would want proof that firms had policies in place to deal with common issues, such as handling customer complaints and keeping data private, but rarely delved into great detail.

If a firm called to report a compliance problem, in most cases the FSA's reaction would be to ask what the firm was doing internally to prevent a recurrence, rather than to open an investigation.

All that has changed. Hector Sants, FSA chief executive, has warned City executives that regulators will be "judging the judgments" that board members make. The shift has come as something of a shock.

"No firm is 100 per cent compliant, but now when firms report problems, they are no longer saying 'thank you for telling us about it'. We are moving from a reporting system to one where the FSA looks into things and makes its own mind up," Says Tim Dolan, lawyer with Pinsent Masons.

Lawyers and bankers round the Square Mile are saying that the regulator appears to be moving towards an "enforcement-led" approach, in which the FSA uses fines and crimi

# Exhibit 15.16 continued nal cases to deter misbehaviour rather than a quiet word.

"Five years ago, enforcement was the dog that didn't bark. Now it is very much on the top table," says a partner at one top City law firm.

In practical terms, the shift is clearly visible. City brokers and banks say that when supervisory visits uncover issues, the FSA is now requiring them to hire outside experts - usually from the big audit firms - to do what are known as section 166 investigations, after the section of the law that enables them.

The reports are funded by the firms but not controlled by them and go straight to the FSA. "It's  $600,000 to$ 1m - and you've got [an accounting firm] hanging around the place for 10 weeks," fumes one chief executive.

Executives and board members are finding they can no longer tell the FSA that particular issues are being handled by the risk or compliance departments.

"If the FSA asks someone an question, it expects them to have a answer," says Jan Putnis, of lawyers Slaughter & May. "The FSA has said: 'Why don't you know about that?"

The regulators have also invited themselves to board meetings of at least half a dozen big banks and brokers. In some cases they have made presentations, but in others they have simply watched the proceedings and interviewed directors afterwards.

"Governance is important, so how else would you assess it?" says Lyndon Nelson, the FSA's head of risk.

The FSA is also making it harder for financial services firms from other European Union countries to exercise their right to "passport" into London.

They recently demanded detailed liquidity information from a French firm and are trying to impose conditions on how the London branch would be treated in a failure.

US banks, meanwhile, report that they are being required to keep more cash or highly liquid bonds in their UK branches to prevent a repeat of the Lehman Brothers failure, when it emerged that the US parent had swept most of the UK's cash across the Atlantic before its collapse.

Above all lawyers and bankers say, the FSA is poking its nose into new areas, asking to review client files, looking at particular contracts and generally asking for more data.

"They are looking more closely at contract terms for retail custom ers and saying you need to change them. They have always had the power but they are using it in a more strategic way then we have seen before," says Michael Raffan, partner at law firm Freshfields.

Not surprisingly, many in the City are not pleased.

"Our clients feel it is a sledgehammer to crack a nut," says Tom O'Riordan of the Paul Hasting law firm. "The regulators are invasively telling them that [certain synthetic financial] products are not appropriate for these markets. They will say, if you were to sell it, we would want x, y, z conditions."

Some observers wonder if the FSA is setting itself too hard a task.

"The FSA is creating very high expectations for its engagement with banks," says James Gardner, a partner at Linklaters. "Interviewing incoming management for licensing purposes is one thing - but if the FSA really is going to carry on monitoring whether executives properly understand their business model, this may stretch its resources very thin."

## Consumer complaints

There are three steps a person with a grievance can take.

1 Raise the issue with the financial service company All firms should have a formal complaints procedure, and the complainant is encouraged by the FSA/FCA to start here, giving the firm a chance to right the wrong. After all, the firm is best placed to check its records and see what happened. Most regulated firms have compliance officers whose job it is to ensure the FSA/ FCA rules are being followed. Roughly three out of four complainants dissatisfied with the response of the company choose not to pursue it further, believing it would be futile to do so. However, there are further positive steps a complainant could take.

2 Independent complaints scheme Most financial services firms belong to an independent complaints scheme – the FSA/FCA insists in most cases. These are beneficial to the system because they increase the confidence of investors and other financial clients by responding to the fear of consumers that they lack knowledge (information asymmetry) to be able to stand up to the financial professionals. There are two types: arbitration schemes and ombudsman schemes. Under both the complaint will be investigated and, if found to be justified, the firm will be ordered to put matters right. Many of the schemes provide for a financial award, up to a maximum of £150,000. Under arbitration both the complainant and the firm agree in advance to accept the arbitrator's decision. Importantly, in accepting this the complainant gives up the right to take the case to court. The advantage is that it is much quicker and cheaper than going to court. Under the Financial Ombudsman Scheme (FOS) the independent and impartial ombudsman collects together the facts of the case and arrives at what seems to them a reasonable and fair settlement. The firm is then under an obligation to accept the decision, but the complainant remains free to take the case to court. The service is free to consumers. The ombudsman's approach is less legalistic than arbitration and allows for more 'common-sense' factors of fairness. The FOS looks at complaints about most financial problems involving:

banking; insurance;

- mortgages; credit cards and store cards;
loans and credit; pensions;
- savings and investments;
- hire purchase and pawnbrokering; money transfer;
- financial advice;
- stocks, shares, unit trusts and bonds.

If the FOS finds in the complainant's favour it can order a firm to pay compensation up to a maximum of £150,000. The FOS may even order the firm to pay compensation for distress and inconvenience on top of financial loss.

3 Go to court Litigation is often expensive, time-consuming and frustrating, and so should only be contemplated as a last resort. A relatively fast and informal service is provided by the small claims track or the small claims court (maximum claim in England £5,000, Northern Ireland £2,000 and Scotland £3,000). The complainant does not need a solicitor, and court fees are low. The complainant may not even have to attend the court as judges can make judgements on the paper evidence.

## Compensation

The complaint steps described in the last section are all well and good if the firm that has behaved badly is still in existence. But what if it is defunct? The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) can compensate consumers (and small companies) if an authorised company is unable to pay money it owes. Note that if a consumer does business with a firm not authorised by the FSA/FCA, e.g. an offshore company, they are not covered by FSCS or the complaints procedure.

The FSCS service is free for the consumer and small business. It covers investments (e.g. bad advice, bad investment management), money deposited in accounts (at banks, building societies and credit unions), insurance products (e.g. car insurance, life insurance), mortgage advice, pensions and endowments. For investments and home finance (mortgages) the maximum payout is £50,000 per person. For deposit claims (e.g. bank accounts) the scheme pays £85,000 per person (per bank). For insurance the scheme pays 90 per cent of the loss.

In order to compensate victims of mis-selling or other malpractice the FSCS raises money from the financial service firms via a regular annual levy supplemented by additional levies in years of high compensation payouts, and this can be very costly for them – see Exhibit 15.17. Examples of some of the charges for the Keydata compensation: Brewin Dolphin paid £6m, IG Group paid £4 million and Charles Stanley £2.6 million. No wonder they were upset! – but, at least the compensation helps maintain the image of fairness to customers.

### Exhibit 15.17

### Fund managers to foot Keydata bill

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/a66270212873448a268adf663be1d3bd6949f2d234cdd82849dda2f3d326aff0.jpg)

By Alice Ross

Fund management groups are being forced to pay  $236\mathrm{m}$  towards the cost of compensating investors who lost money in the collapse of Keydata, the structured product provider, in a move that has angered the industry.

Some larger fund managers face unexpected bills totalling millions of pounds after the Financial Services Compensation Scheme said the fund management industry would have to take the hit for a mis-selling case that would normally have been paid for by financial advisers.

Nearly 30,000 investors lost money after buying "death bond" packages sold by Keydata, which was put into administration in 2009.

Almost 20,000 are eligible to claim compensation from the FSCS, which this week said it would have to raise a special levy in order to make the payments.

The £326m levy was so large the FSCS had to pass most of the cost on to fund managers, even though they are in a separate group from financial advisers for compensation purposes.

Investments intermediaries are subject to a  $100\mathrm{m}$  limit on the amount they have to pay each year.

The FSCS said it was the first time it had demanded that one group pay for the errors of another.

In a sign of the impact that the stock market crash of 2008 and 2009 has had in exposing unsafe products sold to private investors, the FSCS said the need to raise the special levy was a result of the "sharply increasing costs of paying claims resulting from major investment failures".

Fund managers are privately furious that they are being expected to foot most of the bill -  $236\mathrm{m}$  out of the total of  $\mathbb{S}326\mathrm{m}$  - which will be shared among all the fund managers that sell products to retail investors.

The Investment Management Association, the trade body for fund managers, said the Keydata case related to the sale of unlisted bonds issued by a Luxembourg vehicle that owned US life assurance policies - and so had "nothing to do with fund management as conducted by its members".

## Regulation of markets

Financial markets need high-quality regulation in order to induce investors to place their trust in them. There must be safeguards against unscrupulous and incompetent operators. There must be an orderly operation of the markets, fair dealing and integrity. However, the regulations should not be so restrictive as to stifle innovation and prevent the markets from being competitive internationally. London's financial markets have a unique blend of law, self-regulation and custom to regulate and supervise their members' activities.

The FSA/FCA supervises exchanges, clearing houses and settlement houses. It also conducts market surveillance and monitors transactions on seven recognised investment exchanges (RIEs) – see Exhibit 15.13. The RIEs work with the FSA/FCA to protect investors and maintain the integrity of markets. Much of the monitoring and enforcement is delegated to the RIEs. The London Stock Exchange, for example, vets new stockbrokers and tries to ensure compliance with LSE rules, aimed at making sure members (e.g. market makers and brokers) act with the highest standards of integrity, fairness, transparency and efficiency. It monitors market makers' quotations and the price of actual trades to ensure compliance with its dealing rules. It is constantly on the look-out for patterns of trading that deviate from the norm with the aim of catching those misusing information (e.g. insider dealing), creating a false or misleading impression to the disadvantage of other investors or some other market distorting action – see Exhibit 15.18 for an example of a successful prosecution for insider dealing. Mr Littlewood received a prison sentence of over three years, Helmy Omar Sa'id got two years and faced deportation and Angie Littlewood receive a suspended prison sentence.

The LSE, in partnership with the FSA/FCA, also requires companies to disseminate all information that could significantly affect their share prices. It insists on timely and accurate director statements to the stock market so that there is not a false market in the company's shares – see Exhibit 15.19.

### Insider dealers face sentence in long-running FSA case

Jane Croft and Brooke Masters

One of the most far-reaching probes carried out by the Financial Services Authority will reach a conclusion today as the investment banker Christian Littlewood, his wife Angie and her friend Helmy Omar Sa'id are sentenced to their part in a  $\S 2.15\mathrm{m}$  insider trading scam.

The unravelling of the case began in August 2008 when a trading platform flagged a series of well-timed trades before a takeover of Highway Insurance plc.

The FSA found that four separate accounts all linked to Mr Sa'id, a Singaporean national, had collectively made  $\S 160,000$  buying shares in the two weeks before the deal, according to FSA officials who worked on the case. When the FSA looked at Mr Sa'id's other trading records, they spotted suspicious trades around 21 merger announcements.

"Insider lists" of everyone known to have had advance warning of the deals revealed that Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein bankers had worked on 15 of them - but not on the Highway takeover.

Then the FSA investigators struck gold: records showed that Mr Littlewood, a senior Shore Capital corporate financier working on the Highway deal, had previously worked at DKW.

More than two years, four search warrants and 1,700 gigabytes of data later, Mr Littlewood, his wife Angie who traded under her maiden name of Siew-Yoon Lew, and her friend Mr Sa'id have pleaded guilty to eight counts of criminal insider trading from 2000 to 2009. They are scheduled to be sentenced this morning.

The case underlines the FSA's renewed determination to uncover and punish insider dealing by market professionals.

"This outcome is the result of a long, hard slog," said Margaret Cole, FSA managing director for enforcement. Faced with 10 years of banking and trading data that showed the trio had made  \$590,000 in profits on\$ 2.15m in trades, Mr Littlewood's lawyer argued at the sentencing hearing that the other two participants were more culpable. Although the 37-year-old banker, who made as much as 350,000 a year, had repeatedly provided information to his wife, Lord Macdonald QC said his client was not aware of the "scale" of the trading.

Lord Macdonald said Mr Littlewood had told his wife to limit her trades to 20,000 rather than the hundreds of thousands she and

Mr Sa'id invested before takeovers in stocks such as RCO Holdings and Staffware.

"The level of trading is a strong pointer here, he was not aware of its scale," Lord Macdonald told the court, adding: "No sensible person could believe this trading would fail to be noticed… it was suicidal."

But Nicholas Dean QC, prosecuting, told the court that before Mr Littlewood met his wife, his then girlfriend - dubbed "Miss N" - had invested in shares linked to DKW clients, as suggested by Mr Littlewood.

"Miss N carried out all the trading and Christian Littlewood provided the capital but she added some savings," Mr Dean told the court, adding that the couple had made profits of  $20,000$ . Soon afterwards, Mr Littlewood met his wife and they married in 2000. Within months, Mrs Littlewood and Mr Sa'id, an old friend of hers from Singapore, were buying thousands of pounds in shares before pricesensitive deals that caused the price to rise.

### FSA to probe profit warnings

Leading companies are being probed by the financial watchdog over possible failures to disclose key data to the stock market, in a wide-ranging crackdown that threatens fines and prosecutions.

Top City lawyers say they have seen a surge in inquiries by the Financial Services Authority about whether businesses - including Rentokil Initial, the support services company, and Rok, the building group - kept investors properly informed ahead of profits warnings that sent shares tumbling.

Lawyers say the regulator's focus on disclosure could lead to disputes with companies over

# Exhibit 15.19 continued what information should have been revealed and when, especially given the chaotic wider circumstances surrounding many decisions during the credit crisis.

The regulator's more frequent approaches to leading multinationals during the past few months shows it was "really hot on people updating the market promptly", said Sara George, a barrister at Allen & Overy and a former FSA prosecutor.

"The expectation is you drop everything else. You gather all your directors and advisers in one room and you start drafting, overnight if necessary, to make sure there is not a false market in your shares," she said.

Lawyers for big companies said they had seen a sharp rise in the numbers of letters sent by the FSA's supervisory arm to ask for background information about profits warnings, particularly when these resulted in share price falls of 10 per cent or more.

The FSA's inquiries have led to an increase in cases referred to its enforcement department for full investigation, people familiar with the matter say. The probes, which are still at an early stage, could lead to fines for companies for breaking listing rules or criminal prosecutions of executives for "market abuse".

## Regulation of companies

If you invest in a company by buying its shares or bonds, you have a right to receive information about that company, and to expect that there are laws and other pressures to discourage the management from going astray and acting against your interests.

There are various checks and balances in the corporate world, the most important being the requirements under the Companies Acts. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills enforces the law and is able to intrude into a company's affairs. Accountants and auditors also function, to some extent, as regulators, helping to ensure companies do not misrepresent their position. The Financial Reporting Council oversees corporate reporting. Furthermore, any member of the public may access the accounts of any company easily and cheaply at Companies House (www.companieshouse.gov.uk). In the case of mergers of listed or other public limited companies, the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers acts to ensure fairness for all shareholders.

The Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission investigate, rule on and enforce remedies with regard to anti-competitive behaviour - see Exhibit 15.20 for an example of their impact on financial services.

### RBS fine sets cost on 'cosy and rotten practices'

FT

By Michael Peel and Sharlene Goff

The near- $\S 30\mathrm{m}$  fine on Royal Bank of Scotland for breaking competition rules is a small fraction of the cost of bailing out the company but a big reminder of official determination to tackle a long-neglected area of corporate law.

RBS's penalty for sharing loan-pricing data with Barclays employees dwarfs most Financial Services Authority sanctions and is almost as much as the punishment imposed this year on the arms dealer BAE Systems to settle a five-year criminal probe into suspected bribery.

The RBS fine is the latest in a series of cases brought by the Office of Fair Trading as it grapples with the cosy but illegal sharing of pricing information that it believes has become rooted in several big industries.

Ali Nikpay, the OFT's senior director of cartels and criminal enforcement, says: "What we are trying to do with cases like this is send a clear message that this kind of activity really does carry substantial penalties".

RBS is being fined because it admitted its staff "unilaterally" shared information with Barclays on the pricing of loans to large law, accountancy and property firms, the OFT says. The communication took place "on the fringes of social, client or industry events or through telephone conversations".

The penalty is the culmination of a two-year investigation triggered when Barclays volunteered information on its role, a decision that meant the bank escaped penalties under OFT leniency rules aimed at encouraging informants.

The RBS fine came on the same day as Philip Collins, the OFT chairman, said the watchdog had begun to ask questions about whether City markets were competitive and offered good value to consumers and the wider economy.

Mr Nikpay says Mr Collins's comments were not co-ordinated with the RBS announcement and not part of a wider OFT assault on the banking industry although he acknowledges the watchdog takes a "holistic look at these things"

A free press has a very important role in ferreting out and reporting foul play, poor service, incompetence and chicanery. The pensions regulator (discussed in Chapter 4) also has quite an impact on financial services – see Exhibit 15.21 for an example.

### Exhibit 15.21

### Regulator sets sights on pension fund risks

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/c3025a6226b46a1548b10fa4b8bd4336d607b594cec4996773a55ad5d5388ee6.jpg)

By Norma Cohen

Pension funds will be prevented from investing in risky assets, including stocks, by the Pensions Regulator under plans to stop weaker companies with large pension shortfalls from making huge bets.

David Norgrove, chairman of the regulator, will outline his concerns that some schemes are taking risks that could leave a bigger hole in the industry funded Pension Protection Fund in a speech to funds today.

"We have to ensure that they are not putting all their money on the 2:30 at Newmarket and if it doesn't work out, they will fall back on the PPF," he said. "To some extent, we have seen some behaviour like that."

Some schemes were so underfunded their only hope of recovery lay in big bets. The regulator was also concerned about standards of governance, particularly for smaller schemes.

"We come across a fair degree of criminality at the smaller end of schemes," said Mr Norgrove.

Investment curbs would affect a few weak companies initially but as schemes close to new members and to future accruals trustees will need to insure that the investment strategy takes as few risks as possible. "Eventually it will move up the scale," he said. Companies will need to be well funded and have few or no investment risks.

Under those circumstances, defined benefit schemes might cease to be significant investors in equities and property.

Mr Norgrove said that despite cash injections from employers, defined benefit schemes today are not much better funded. "Contributions have had to run to keep up with rising longevity, falling discount rates and shortfalls in investment returns," he said. "We clearly can't have a situation where we move from recovery plan to recovery plan."

## Fraud and money laundering

Fraud costs the UK economy an estimated £38 billion annually, equivalent to £765 for every adult member of the population. The FSA/FCA is one of several UK organisations that investigates and responds to suspicions of fraud. The City of London Police is, however, the 'National Lead

Force' for fraud with a remit to create a centre of excellence for fraud investigations and to use its expertise to help police forces across the UK. It has a large squad (178 personnel at the last count) focused solely on preventing and detecting fraud.[10] It is particularly concerned with organised crime groups and securing major convictions. It manages hundreds of fraud investigations each year. In 2010, for example, it identified 124 organised criminal gangs and had 154 defendants charged and awaiting prosecution at court.

Here are some examples of the frauds they stopped:

- In a boiler room investigation,\* a Danish man was arrested by Spanish police and extradited to the UK in May 2009. This followed a joint investigation by the City of London and Dyfed-Powys Police. The fraudster was sentenced to nearly five years in prison after pleading guilty to running criminal operations that sold worthless or highly inflated shares to more than 500 investors, with a combined loss of more than £2 million.
- Operation Soundwave led to a national and international investigation into a £25 million boiler room fraud. Over Christmas 2009, Northumbria and Greater Manchester Police assisted 20 City officers in making 12 arrests in the north of England. At the same time detectives travelled to Sweden to arrest the main suspect and later had him extradited back to the UK.
- A man who attempted to steal more than 170 million was sentenced to nine years after an international investigation. The 32-year-old Edinburgh man's complex fraud involved taking over corporate accounts before he was stopped by City of London Police officers.

*In a boiler room scam the fraudsters harass potential investors through regular telephone calls or over the internet, eventually persuading them that they should invest in a 'great opportunity'. Needless to say, they are selling something of little or no value. Millions of pounds each year are taken from savers – particularly old people.

The National Fraud Authority (NFA), operating a website Action Fraud, is the UK's national fraud reporting centre providing a central point of contact for information about fraud. People who are scammed, ripped off or conned can report a fraud, find help and support. The National Fraud Authority is an umbrella government organisation which coordinates and oversees the fight against fraud.

Insurance companies club together to pay for the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) to combat bogus insurance claims. If this was not tackled all our insurance premiums would rise to pay for payouts to criminals lying about damage, theft, etc. Even when the bogus claims are kept under control by the IFB we are still paying far more for our insurance than would be the case if everyone was honest - estimated at an extra £44 p.a. by the IFB. The IFB concentrates on networks of fraudsters who repeat the crime, leaving most of the one-off frauds, such as deliberate damage to goods, to the insurance companies.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigates and prosecutes serious or complex fraud and corruption exceeding £1 million in value. It is a part of the criminal justice system – but remains an independent government department (with a high degree of autonomy from political control). It builds cases and brings criminals to justice and so helps maintain confidence in the UK's business and financial institutions.

If a suspected fraud is likely to give rise to widespread public concern, be complex and thus require specialist knowledge to investigate, or be international in scope, then the SFO is likely to be the organisation that tackles it. While much of its work is financial service related the majority is not, for example it investigated whether BAE Systems had been involved in corruption (bribes to Saudi officials) when selling arms to Saudi Arabia in the £43 billion Al Yamamah deal. Exhibit 15.22 describes a successful SFO prosecution for fraud.

### Two found guilty in Torex fraud case

By Jane Croft and Philip Stafford

Two former Torex Retail executives have been convicted of defrauding the shareholders of former Aimquoted group.

Edwin Dayan and Christopher Ford were directors at the retail softwear company's subsidiary XN Checkout (XNC) and caused more than  $1.65\mathrm{m}$  in fictitious profits to be recognised within the company's published accounts.

The conviction draws a line under the case that was taken on by the Serious Fraud Office in 2007 after whistleblowers from Torex came to the prosecutor with information about alleged accounting irregularities at the company.

Mr Dayan was managing director of XNC and sat on Torex's main board as chief technology officer. Mr Ford was XNC's finance director.

The subsidiary had a contract to provide a depot repair service for equipment to Mitchells & Butlers, the pub and restaurant operator. After it lost the contract to IBM, it continued to provide the service as it was retained by IBM as subcontractor.

After 2003 IBM renegotiated the agreement with XNC so the amount it paid was reduced, which led to a shortfall in XNC's income.

The court heard that during the preparation of Torex's 2005 annual accounts, the two men created documents to make it look as if M&B had agreed to pay the shortfall and were liable to pay an extra sum to XNC for the service.

That was given to Torex's auditors BDO Stoy Hayward to justify an additional  $\S 756,000$  in profit that was then entered into the accounting records of the parent Torex.

The two men continued the fabrication in Torex's 2006 accounts that were also bolstered by a further  $900,000$ . In reality no money was owed by M&B and there was no agreement between the two companies about the shortfall.

Money laundering is concealing the source of illegally obtained money. It is the process of changing money obtained from crimes, such as drug trafficking, into a form that appears to be legitimate. The process often involves multiple international transactions across currencies and financial institutions in order to obscure the source. To combat money laundering the UK regulators require that any bank, share broker or other financial firm being asked to open an account for a person or company has to verify the customer's identity. Even solicitors carrying out house conveyancing are required to see purchasers' forms of identity, such as passports, driving licence and utility bills (even if they have known the client for years and asked for the same documents only months before for an earlier transaction!). Financial firms are also required to look out for suspicious transactions and report them. The FSA/FCA penalises firms that lack adequate systems and controls to detect and report money laundering. There are some people within the finance industry who help money launderers, using their contacts and knowledge about jurisdictions abroad where policing is lax. Criminal investigators are tasked with tracking them down. Suspected money laundering is reported to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), which is assisted by other investigating agencies such as the police. The City of London Police also have a major role here.

## European Union regulation

As well as national financial service regulation we have another layer for the countries in the European Union. Only a brief overview can be provided here. We will concentrate on the basic principles that the EU legislators are applying and look at a few examples of the pan-European rules that have already been introduced.

The fundamental objective of the EU is to promote movement towards a single market in financial services regardless of national boundaries. It is thought movement toward such a goal will bring about improved welfare for consumers and faster economic growth. The Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) is the process devised by the European Commission to provide momentum towards a single integrated market. It has three strategic objectives (not all are achieved):

1 Establishing a single market in wholesale financial services, including: the establishment of a common legal framework for securities and derivatives markets;

- providing the necessary legal certainty to underpin cross-border securities trading. This includes integrated securities settlement systems;
- the removal of the outstanding barriers to raising capital on an EU-wide basis.

Many national rules hinder the offering of securities in other EU countries, making it costly. One action is to have common minimum rules on the contents of a prospectus when a company is raising money by selling securities (already, once a prospectus has been approved in one EU country it has a 'passport' to sell the securities in others);

- having a single set of rules for financial statements for listed companies. To a large extent this has been achieved because all EU countries have adopted International Financial Reporting Standards;
- a joined-up pension framework so that people can move to work in another country without fear of pension complications;
- rules on cross-border mergers of public limited companies, protecting minority shareholders.

2 Making retail markets more open and secure. Creating a legal framework to allow financial institutions to offer their services throughout the EU by removing obstacles that hamper the cross-border purchasing or provision of these services (e.g. single bank account, mortgage credit). This includes:

- making sure that consumers are provided with clear and understandable information when they are investing some or all of their savings in another country;
- there are efficient and effective procedures for redress for incompetent, crooked or other malpractice in cross-border services;
- reducing the charges on low-value transfers of money between EU countries by encouraging more efficient, cheaper cross-border payments system, e.g. on credit card payments.

3 Strengthening the rules on prudential supervision. This covers areas such as capital and liquidity adequacy of banks and solvency margins for insurance companies.

The two key elements for achieving these objectives have been the principle of mutual recognition and the application of agreed minimum standards:

- Mutual recognition If a financial firm has been authorised to offer a service by one EU member state it is then free to operate in other member states selling its service there without requiring further authorisation from the host countries.
- Minimum standards Agreeing minimum standards for financial services. This ensures that if a firm is authorised by its home regulator it abides by reasonably tough rules that would protect clients throughout the EU – there is not a 'race to the bottom' by countries deliberately offering a lax regulatory environment to attract financial service firms to set up in their countries or to promote the growth of their domestic firms by lowering their costs or allowing doubtful activity.

Note that there is no attempt to create either full harmonisation in which the rules are identical in each country ('one size fits all'), or a common regulatory structure with a large centralised bureaucracy or a single European regulator in Brussels. The member states would not accept this level of interference in their economies. Politically, it is far easier for them to agree to adopt minimum standards and a 'passport' system, in which the granting of a licence in one EU country is sufficient for a financial firm to sell its services in all EU member states.

Dozens of 'directives' have been published by the European Commission and then implemented by member countries. Some of the most significant directives:

- Capital Liberalisation Directive, 1988 Money can be moved from one country to another without controls. This free movement was given a boost when the majority of EU states adopted the euro in 1999.
Capital Requirements Directive, 2006 Common minimum rules on bank and investment firm capital adequacy.12 The directive links to the Basel rules - see Chapter 7.
- First Banking Directive, 1977 Banks became free to open branches or establish subsidiaries in other member states. These were to operate under the supervisory rules of the host country. This limited the range of services to only those accepted by the host country's regulations. Thus a subsidiary of a French bank in Spain could only do what the Spanish regulators allowed local banks to do.
- Second Banking Directive, 1989 A single banking licence allowed operations throughout the EU. This allowed a bank licensed in one EU country to sell its services in other EU countries regardless of whether the host country normally allows these services to be provided by its domestic banks. The activities permitted under this rule are those on an approved list and include securities business as well as banking services. As a safeguard the home and host country supervisors exchange information as they now have to share supervision. Home country regulators have the main responsibility, but host country regulators can impose monetary policy-related rules, e.g. liquidity reserves, and supervise consumer protection.
- **Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), 2007** This is aimed at reducing the cost of trading securities and increase market competition in the investment services provided by stockbrokers, fund managers, derivative dealers and banks. Firms authorised in one member state to undertake specific services are able to perform the same ones in other EU countries. It also opened up stock exchanges to more competition by allowing trading to take place away from regulated exchanges. See Chapter 8 for more on Mifid, including a discussion of the 'best-execution' requirement for stockbrokers to obtain the best price, low cost of execution, speed and the likelihood of settlement of the trade going well.
- Market Abuse Directive, 2003 A common EU legal framework for preventing and detecting market abuse and for ensuring a proper flow of information to the market. EU countries must reach the minimum standards in the directive. National regulators may pursue market abusers, including insider dealers, by either a civil case (requiring merely proof 'on the balance of probabilities') or a criminal case ('beyond reasonable doubt' - a much higher standard of proof). It also requires greater interchange of information between national regulators to better unearth wrong-doing.
- Transparency Directive, 2004 All issuers of publicly-traded securities must provide annual financial reports within four months of their year-ends. The directive also sets the minimum content of annual, half-yearly and interim management statements. In addition there are minimum notification requirements for both issuers and investors in relation to the acquisition and disposal of the major holdings in companies, e.g. major shareholdings have to be publicly reported and any subsequent changes announced.[12]

In addition to agreeing to abide by directives, occasionally the EU states agree that they will all impose common rules on the financial sector – see Exhibit 15.23 for an example on bankers' bonuses.

There is now a college of national supervisors – the European System of Financial Supervisors. Under this, three authorities, focused on different aspects of financial services, were created in 2011:

### Exhibit 15.23

### EU sets new pay practices in stone

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/ae62e16cf8df00b5b4aba6343098a6eb4f0c646f4c9fe882f1a98e3087e149d1.jpg)

The European Union's new rules forcing banks to defer bonuses and limit cash payouts to employees would be among the strictest in the world.

The legislation sets in stone practices on pay that banks were forced to adopt after the crisis and introduces another layer of rules in an area which banks had hoped had moved out of the regulatory spotlight.

Under legislation agreed by the European Parliament and the council of member states, banks in the 27-nation bloc would have to defer 40 to 60 per cent of bonus payments for at least three years and at least half of the money would have to be paid in shares or other instruments linked to the banks' performance.

One effect, perhaps unanticipated by legislators, will be that lower-paid bankers are likely to be more affected in the short term than the high fliers in the public eye.

The biggest global institutions still generally determine the mix of cash and shares awarded on a sliding scale. Star traders allotted a  $5\mathrm{m}$  bonus will receive as little as 5 per cent of that in cash, while a relatively junior banker earmarked for  $\$100,000$  may still receive the total in cash at some banks.

That means the new EU rules would probably have the most impact on junior employees, rather than top rainmakers who already live with big deferrals.

Supporters of the EU bonus restrictions argue they will prevent banks from slipping back to the guaranteed bonuses and cash bonanzas that were common before the financial crisis.

"For too long, the incentives have been all wrong, encouraging excessive risk taking," argued Michel Barnier, EU internal market commissioner, who oversees financial regulation this week.

"These rules will help to put an end to the dangerous short-term behaviour we have seen," he claimed, adding that Brussels wants similar rules for the rest of the financial sector. But industry officials warn that inflexible legislation could undermine Europe's ability to attract and retain top talent. While the US and Asian nations in the Group of 20 have endorsed the principles of deferred bonuses and limiting cash payments, most have shield away from strict rules.

"If the G20 countries based outside of the EU fail to implement equivalent regimes these rules will have little impact in terms of eliminating risk-taking behaviour but will have a hugely detrimental impact upon our international competitiveness," said Stuart Fraser, policy chairman of the City of London.

In practice, the EU rules are not all that different from those set down in several European countries like the Netherlands and by the UK Financial Services Authority.

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) Headquartered in London, the EBA is concerned with ensuring EU-wide coordination on regulatory and supervisory standards with a focus on the stability of the financial system. It stress-tests European banks – examines and probes for weaknesses by imagining a set of adverse circumstances (e.g. a perfect storm combination of a rise in interest rates, high loan default rates and loss of bank access to money market funds). It will have much to say on the adoption of new capital and liquidity reserve standards over the next few years.
- The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) Based in Frankfurt, it focuses on EU coordination of rules for the protection of insurance policy holders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries. In the immediate future it will implement a new set of capital reserve rules for insurance companies (Solvency II), which results in more risk leading to more capital requirements.
- The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Located in Paris, it tries to improve the EU regulators' coordination on the functioning of markets and strengthen investor protection. It is charged with harmonising the regulation of issuance and trading of shares, bonds and other securities. It covers matters of corporate governance, auditing, financial reporting, takeover bids, clearing and settlement and derivative issues. It is currently working on a new directive on hedge funds and private equity and new rules on over-the-counter derivatives trading. It already has powers to fine credit rating agencies for breaching EU rules.

The committees of these three organisations, made up of the heads of national regulators, have the responsibility to try to achieve greater convergence of regulatory standards and practices across the EU. They will produce technical standards and plan for the adoption of EU regulatory law throughout the EU – some countries have been lax in adopting the EU-wide rules in the past and so need a little chivvying along.

Despite past attempts to gain greater cooperation at the EU level, regulation remains mostly a national affair, embedded in domestic regulation. However, these new bodies will have the power to override national authorities in 'emergency situations'. Also, the political mood seems to be to grant more powers to pan-EU regulatory bodies, and it is thought that their powers to override national regulators will be extended into a greater range of products and markets than those listed above.

In addition to these three, a new EU body, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), was set up in 2011. It has whistle-blowing powers to prevent future crises. That is, it has powers to issue warnings and recommendations when it sees threats to economies or financial systems. The European Central Bank takes the lead role in the ESRB, but national central bankers dominate the board. We will have to wait and see if it is merely a talking shop fretting over, say, house prices in Spain and excess property lending in Ireland, but lacking teeth to do anything about a wayward economy.

Many people, particularly in the City of London, think that too much control over financial services and markets is being granted to pan-European regulators, who may not fully understand the needs of a financial centre like the City and who may have political agendas (e.g. to grab business from London) – see Exhibit 15.24.

### Exhibit 15.24

### Traders fear threat of political agendas

# Nikki Tait

Radical changes to Europe's system of supervising its banks, insurers and securities markets, taking effect this week, are central to plans by the European Union to bolster financial regulation and oversight in the 27-country bloc.

The creation of four new pan-European agencies is aimed at helping to prevent a repeat of the region's financial crisis. But the new supervisory bodies are being watched warily by traders and executives in the City of London, Europe's biggest financial centre.

London's fear is that the new entities' job of drawing up common, harmonised rules for the finance sector and protecting it from systemic problems will be overtaken by political agendas, and that the bodies will not appreciate sufficiently the need to keep Europe competitive with other global financial centres.

"It's an unsettling process. A single market [for financial services] is a good thing… But people need to be close to the markets they're regulating," says Barney Reynolds, head of the financial regulatory group at the law firm Shearman & Sterling in London.

The concern he adds is that the agencies may follow "a moralistic political agenda", rather than conduct a "dispassionate technical exercise".

On Tuesday, a European Commission spokesman hailed the creation of the new regulators as a "turning point in financial supervision in Europe", saying they would strengthen a system whose weaknesses had been laid bare by the financial crisis. In the process, they will also make Europe's financial sector more attractive to investors and more competitive, the spokesman said.

The four new agencies comprise three European supervisory authorities (ESAs) to oversee the banking, insurance and securities markets sectors, together with a broader European Systemic Risk Board

(ESRB), which will warn about dangers building in the financial systems.

All three are being created from existing pan-European "committees" which are made up of national regulators from the 27 EU member states and function on a co-operative basis. By contrast, the new authorities will have more powers - including the ability to override national authorities in emergency situations - and greater resources, both in terms of staff and finance.

But the ESAs are expected to acquire about 150 staff in total in 2011 and cost about €40m (53m) to run. That staffing should then double during the next four years - although it will remain a pale shadow of some national supervisors. The UK's Financial Services Authority, for example, employs more than 3,000.

The process of building up the ESAs' responsibilities is likely to accelerate through this year.

# Exhibit 15.24 continued

At least a dozen significant legislative proposals for the financial services sector are due to be released in 2011, and most will give specific rulemaking rights to the ESAs.

That means City institutions and their advisers will need to keep a close watch on Brussels, but also on Paris, Frankfurt and London, as they try to guard against excessive regulation.

"Unless you're keeping a hawk-eye, you blink and miss things," warns Mr Reynolds.

## Global regulation

Following the financial crisis in 2008 there is much more enthusiasm within the policy-making classes for supra-national regulation, or, at least, coordination of regulatory rules. A good example of rules being set on a global scale (or at least for most of the world) is the Basel Committee's rules on bank capital reserves and liquidity rules - see Chapter 7.

To gain help from the International Monetary Fund, a country must open markets to overseas trade, flows of capital and liberate banks from stifling controls. The Financial Stability Board is charged with the task of developing supervisory and other policies to promote financial stability. It also coordinates with the IMF in sounding alarm bells about vulnerabilities in financial systems. For example, it is currently working on the too big to fail problem in banking.

There are a number of international organisations established by the relevant industry itself to promote higher standards of behaviour. For example, the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is a global financial trade association for the world's major institutions that deal in privately negotiated derivatives.[14] Its purpose is to identify and reduce the sources of risk in the derivatives business. It sets standards for members, writes standardised contracts that members are encouraged to use, comments on netting and collateral arrangements, promotes sound risk management practices, and advances the understanding and treatment of derivatives and risk management.

## Some gaps in the system?

One major problem is overcoming the political obstacles to effective international regulation. There is always a temptation for the country that would like to build up its financial service sector to race to the bottom, because footloose financial institutions are attracted by 'lightness of regulation' and will move. Thus regulatory arbitrage will always be with us, with some aspects of finance moving to the least regulated jurisdiction. Hence the need for robust international agreements on minimum standards. The problem is that each country examines a proposal for a tighter rule in the light of an assessment of the impact on its competitiveness. The intention of the national policy makers too often seems to be 'to find a regulatory regime that crimps competitors more than one's own companies'. Hence the slowness in achieving worldwide (or G20) agreement on issues as diverse as bankers' bonuses (the new US rules are more flexible than the EU ones) or banning investment banks from proprietary trading (the US is strict, other countries less so, leaving loopholes).

On the other hand, the widespread recognition that under-regulation contributed to the 2008 financial crisis has reinforced the view that policy makers do not serve their people well if they allow too much slack. The tension between the desire for an easy-going light-touch regulated financial centre – egged on by bankers, etc. threatening to leave for more accommodating environments – and the need to protect consumers will always be with us. It will be interesting to see how the politicians resolve the tension over the next few years (it does not help that such a high proportion of political party donations in the UK and US come from the finance sector).

Another major problem is that the regulators have paid little attention to the less obvious, but powerful, sectors within the financial system. I'm referring to the 'shadow banking system'. This is the collection of non-bank entities that move money and risk around the global financial system, bypassing the banks. The usual candidates to be included in this group include:

- Hedge funds Raising funds directly from wealthy individuals and institutional investors, they have a large and growing role in debt, equity and derivative markets. A failure of a large hedge fund could destabilise the markets and the banking system given that banks are often the counterparties in derivative and other deals, and they also lend to the funds.
- Private equity funds Originally set up to raise funds from long-term investors to invest in non-quoted companies, some have branched out into debt trading, and even have hedge fund arms. Failure of these ventures could pose a threat to banks and the wider system, as could a failure of a large leveraged buyout. Some funds have loan books larger than that of many banks. Much of that money was raised through bank borrowing, thus a failure to repay could imperil banks.
- Money market funds These bypass the banks by taking short-term money from investors to buy commercial paper and other securities. It was their abrupt withdrawal from lending via commercial paper, etc. following some defaults that caused corporates and banks to be unable to rollover their debt, leading many to failure in 2008. Many money market funds supplied cash for repayment over, say, 30 days. This was used to lend out on 25-year mortgages. Thus, non-banks (money market funds and special purpose vehicles issuing long-term bonds as securitised bonds) became conduits for maturity transformation, where short-term money is lent out into long-term securities. The expectation by those who borrowed from the money market funds was that they would always be there to supply more money, every 30 days. This was a silly assumption.
- Securitisation The securitisation of assets such as sub-prime mortgages greatly assisted the growth of the housing finance market. These securitised bonds were then repackaged (see Chapter 16) which created pockets of extreme risk in the financial system and as a result many banks failed.
- Commodity funds The banks are bypassed and money is placed at risk with large bets being taken on future movements of commodity prices using derivatives and borrowing. They might blow up resulting in huge losses, which might pose knock-on risks throughout the financial system, as banks might face bad debts.
- Clearing houses These processors of trading activity handle billions every day, asking for only a small margin in their role as central counterparties. They tend to have little capital in reserve, so in the event of a few defaults by traders the system might be in trouble. Contagious fear could spread if investors worry about the clearing house's promise to guarantee every deal. This could halt lending and other deals for a while.
- Inter-dealer broker If one of these organisations standing between traders and connecting them fails then billions could be lost.

Thus we face the problem that the regulators are busy constructing a strong Maginot Line, $^{16}$  such as raised Basel III capital and liquidity reserves, to protect banks, while the real danger may lie to the side. Risk can and has moved from the regulated and transparent elements in the system to the less regulated opaque sector. The shadow banks have become enormous sources of credit and may well fuel the next bubble, as they assisted with the Noughties one.

The Financial Stability Board has begun looking at shadow banking, and various governments and national regulators are starting to draw up lists of non-banks that might pose a systemic risk. But we are currently, 2011, only at the talking stage. The Federal Reserve Board has put together a chart showing the players in shadow banking – see www.ft.com/shadowbanks.

## Concluding comments

It is a constant battle to maintain high levels of integrity and competence in the financial service sector. It is a battle that will never be completely won. Some people, even highly paid people (viz. investment bankers in 2007), will regularly come up with new ways of losing other people's money through stupidity, greed or chicanery. Despite this pessimistic conclusion we have to acknowledge that we have come a long way in making this vital economic sector reasonably safe for savers and businesses. The financial crisis showed that there are many issues that were not properly dealt with in the past. And so we are currently going through a period of toughening up the controls to avoid risks to consumers and the taxpayer. This is being done on an international scale with an unprecedented degree of cooperation and coordination between the national regulators, as they recognise the potential to miss malpractice in nationally focused systems. We certainly live in interesting times when it comes to regulation. Much will change over the next few years, and where the balance between light-touch and strict control will fall we cannot yet tell. But at least as you hear the debate on TV and read the newspapers over the next few years you will, having read this chapter, understand the core principles and issues around which it revolves.

## Key points and concepts
- Compliance costs: putting in place systems and training to ensure that financial service staff behave according to the regulations.
- Asymmetric information occurs when one party in a negotiation or relationship is not in the same position as other parties, being ignorant of, or unable to observe, some information which is essential to the contracting and decision-making process. Managers and other employees of financial service companies have an information set that is often superior to that of the clients. This can lead to exploitation, for example, buyers of a financial product are unable to assess the true risk and return. Asymmetric information can lead to:
- Reduced safety and soundness for the consumer or a financial market counterparty, e.g. insufficient surplus of assets over liabilities to be able to cover their obligations, concentration risk or bad management of client's stock broker accounts, pension funds and collective investment vehicles.
- Producing conflicts of interest within financial service firms which can result in the misuse or concealment of information or its false or biased use.
- Facilitating bad behaviour such as fraud.
- Hiding and tolerating incompetence.
- Contagion risk: the failure of a company may lead to the failure of others leading to instability in the whole system. Regulation aims to ensure that individual banks have enough capital and liquid assets, that they write and continuously update 'living wills', insist that none is either too big to fail nor that it is too big to save.
- Monopolistic/oligopolistic exploitation: where one or a few firms exert undue market power over product pricing.

Dangers in a regulatory system:

- Moral hazard: the presence of a safety net encourages adverse behaviour.
- Agency capture: when those that are supposed to be regulated take some control of the regulatory process and modify it to suit the interests of the producers rather than the consumers.
- Excessive compliance cost: raised fees and lower returns for customers.
- Stifling innovation and growth: the requirements to be licensed and costs of compliance impose such a bureaucratic load that few or no firms dare to enter the industry, thus inefficient monopolies/oligopolies are sustained.

# - Types of regulation:
- By the industry. Positive points: a clear need to preserve high reputation; people most knowledgeable about the industry are those working in it. Negative points: temptation to slacken the rules; barriers to industry entry; difficult to regulate a firm that has activities in many different financial service industries; dependence on funding from the industry itself to function encourages softness on the producer.
- By the government. Positive point: industry needs an externally imposed regulator. Negative points: heavy handed, less agile than practitioners.
- By government agency. Positive points: legislative back-up to ensure that the agency has strong powers without political control; greater practitioner respect than would be the case if government officers were in charge; poachers turned game-keepers are likely to be more alert and agile in keeping up with the latest tricks; statutory framework that prevents a slackening of the rules or restricting entry of new firms; the regulator can be given the powers to examine a full range of financial services and markets. Negative point: can be expensive.
- Competitive laxity/regulatory arbitrage: financial centres that try to impose strict rules find that financial institutions respond not by tightening their systems and raising probity, but by moving operations to a different jurisdiction, where the rules are looser.

# Core elements of regulation:

-licensing; disclosure and monitoring;
mandatory information provisions and consumer education; prudential limits;
- restricting activities;
- fair trading on exchanges;
- duty of care; exposure limits;
- complaint handling and compensation; penalties.
- The UK's Financial Services Authority, FSA, dominated the scene for over a decade. It is a 'super-regulator' with oversight of a wide range of financial sectors. In 2013 it will split in two. The main body, the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, will be a super-regulator, retaining responsibility for protecting consumers and preserving market integrity. The Prudential Regulatory Authority, PRA, a subsidiary of the Bank of England, will handle individual regulation of the 2,200 biggest banks, insurers and brokers on the issue of safety and soundness (micro-prudential supervision).

The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, FPC, makes decisions that apply to the entire sector to ensure system-wide financial stability, including the avoidance of credit and asset bubbles.

# The FSA/FCA's objectives: maintaining confidence in the financial system;
- protecting consumers; reducing financial crime;
- financial stability; helping people to gain the knowledge, aptitude and skills to manage their financial affairs effectively by promoting public understanding of the financial system.

# The FSA/FCA's tasks:
- authorisation of financial service firms;
- monitoring of adequacy of management, financial resources, internal systems and controls, and ensuring that any information provided to investors is clear, fair and not misleading;
- insisting on systems to deal with complaints;
- through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, compensating badly treated consumers;
- regulation of markets for fair dealing and integrity. Recognised investment exchanges (RIEs) work with the FSA/FCA to protect investors and maintain the integrity of markets;
- regulation of companies.
- Other constraints on bad behaviour: Companies Acts, accountants and auditors, the Financial Reporting Council, FRC, Companies House, City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, a free press, the pensions regulator.
- Fraud investigation in the UK: FSA/FCA, City of London Police is the 'National Lead Force' for fraud, National Fraud Authority (NFA), the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), Serious Fraud Office (SFO).
- Money laundering is concealing the source of illegally obtained money. It is the process of changing money obtained from crimes, such as drug trafficking, into a form that appears to be legitimate. Suspected money laundering is reported to the Serious Organised Crime Agency, SOCA.
- European Union regulation is motivated by movement towards a single market in financial services. The Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) is the process devised by the European Commission to provide momentum towards a single integrated market. It has three strategic objectives:
- establishing a single market in wholesale financial services;
- making retail markets more open and secure;
- strengthening the rules on prudential supervision.

The two key elements for achieving the FSAP objectives have been the principle of mutual recognition and the application of agreed minimum standards. There is no attempt to create either full harmonisation in which the rules are identical in each country ('one size fits all'), or a common regulatory structure.

- Dozens of 'directives' have been published by the European Commission and then implemented by member countries.
European System of Financial Supervisors is a college of national supervisors. Under this, three authorities, focused on different aspects of financial services, were created in 2011:
- The European Banking Authority, EBA: ensuring EU-wide coordination on regulatory and supervisory standards with a focus on the stability of the financial system.
- The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA: focuses on EU coordination of rules for protection of insurance policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries.
- The European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA: tries to improve the EU regulators' coordination on the functioning of markets and strengthening of investor protection.

European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB: has whistle-blowing powers to prevent future crises, powers to issue warnings and recommendations when it sees threats to economies or financial systems.

- Global regulation: the Bank for International Settlements (e.g. Basel III); the International Monetary Fund insisting that a country must open markets to overseas trade, flows of capital and liberate banks from stifling controls; the Financial Stability Board, FSB, is charged with the task of developing supervisory and other policies to promote financial stability and sounding alarm bells about vulnerabilities in the financial system; the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is a global financial trade association for the world's major institutions that deal in privately negotiated derivatives.

Remaining gaps in regulation:

- political pressure to opt for national light-touch regulation;
- the threat posed by the shadow banking system: a collection of non-bank entities that move money and risk around the global financial system, bypassing the banks. Includes hedge funds, private equity funds, money market funds, securitisation, commodity funds, clearing houses and inter-dealer brokers.
