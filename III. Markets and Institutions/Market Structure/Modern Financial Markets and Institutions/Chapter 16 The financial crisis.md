# The financial crisis

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

Understanding the financial crisis is important for us all, so that we learn the lessons from the mistakes of others. By the end of this chapter the reader should be able to: explain, with examples, why it is wrong to rely simple-mindedly on complex mathematics and economic modelling when making financial decisions. Knowledge of history and knowledge of people are more important than algebra in finance;

describe and illustrate the concept of reflexivity which can lead markets to far-from-equilibrium states;

■ discuss the various complex derivative instruments that contributed to the crisis by obscuring from view the real risks individual banks were taking, and to which the whole system was exposed. These range from collateralised debt obligations to structured investment vehicles; provide a description of the stages of the financial crisis itself and the way in which events in the markets driven by exuberance, greed, fear and panic overwhelmed the key players;

explain the key insights we ought to always remember about markets and institutions.

This is a difficult chapter to write. It would have been easy if all I had to do was give a run-down of the sequence of events that took place, or to lay blame at the door of 'greedy bankers', 'incompetent regulators' or 'inattentive governments'. But you already know about sub-prime mortgages, fancy derivatives and relaxed overseers. What I need to do is go behind the obvious and explore the underlying causes. These lie in the rather opaque and confused land of psychology, and in the area of the structure of organisations and systems.

While I will still provide the highlights of the crisis, so you will learn what happened to Lehman Brothers, Northern Rock, etc., they will be set in the much wider context of people factors. There are two aspects to this: (i) people behaving in irrational ways, and (ii) people behaving in entirely rational ways from their perspective, given their incentives, but which result in a stupid/irrational outcome for the system as a whole.

# The autistic mathematicians and the autistic financial economists

The financial centres of the world hire thousands of people every year who are great at maths and mathematical economics. Some have degrees in engineering or physics, others in pure mathematics, economics or even rocket science. They are highly respected, usually have PhDs and can bambozzle you with their mastery of algebraic formulae and mental gymnastics. The pity is that they are applying their skills to an area of intellectual endeavour, called finance, which is not fundamentally mathematical. As the great investors, such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, both with decades of experience, tell us, all the mathematics you need was picked up at school by the time you were 14.[2] They may be exaggerating to make a point, but what the mathophiles are failing to appreciate is that finance is a multifaceted discipline, in which the largest contribution is from the study of human psychology: humans acting in rational and irrational ways as individuals, and humans acting in groups in rational and irrational ways.

So, the mathematicians turn up at the financial centres on large salaries and they impress their bosses, the leaders of the banks and other institutions, who fail to fully take on board the assumptions behind the algebra. But, by golly, they know an impressive formula when they see one – or at least they think they do. The self-confidence of the mathematician is further reinforced by the admiration and intellectual support of their closely related kin, the financial economists. These people have high algebraic skills, too, and like to practise them as often as possible. There are many opportunities to converse in algebra with fellow autistic financial economists. There are regular seminars in the economics departments of universities the world over, where old and young economists start a presentation to fellow economists by making a number of assumptions about the world.

They simplify. They model, you see, so that the problem they are dealing with is tractable. In too many cases, in reality what they are doing is rushing to the bit that they really want to do (the bit they can cope with), where everything is neat and tidy, without too many messy human factors – that is, to use algebra to show an encapsulating view of world. They love to show off modelling skill with algebra. So they spend one minute making assumptions about how humans behave. Usually these 'humans' are wonderfully rational, amazing calculating machines capable of absorbing infinite amounts of information and then ordering and processing it to make rational decisions – just as an economist would.

So, one minute for assumptions and then 49 minutes algebra, leaving 10 for questions. Ah great! Heaven. It does not matter that the assumptions might be a little unrealistic - look at the quality of the 'analysis'. The room is full of fellow blinkered followers of models, except for a few, who sit at the back and, if they are feeling brave, timidly suggest that perhaps the Emperor does not have many clothes on. The assumptions do not fit their everyday experience, it just does not feel right. But those people are quickly silenced. Don't they understand that you have to model the world in a simplistic way, so that you can understand it? 'But,' the brave soul might say, 'if the assumptions and subsequent models leave out vital human factors, such as limited cognitive processing ability, the power of emotions to corrode rational decision making, and the all too apparent failings of individual and collective memory, will they reflect the way people actual behave in market places?' The rest of the room coughs and many have patronising thoughts about the inadequacy of the questioner's thinking. They will get it eventually – one day developing the ability to suspend disbelief.

What we have here is cognitive dissonance. The financial economists have a long-held view of the way people and the markets behave while many of the rest of us may see things differently. If we try to inject the thought of irrational actions into the economist's debate they suffer pain, anxiety, frustration as their deeply embedded beliefs are challenged by clearly relevant facts. Many of the better ones have now taken on board the importance of human psychology and sociological studies, most have not. Furthermore, it is mathematical whizzes who tend to be hired in the financial centres.

Universities are not the only place for rational algebraic debate among financial economists. They have conferences all over the world where they gather and then mutually reinforce their belief in the rightness of their methodological approaches. They have journals into which the most 'sophisticated' papers, in terms of mathematical prowess, have greater chance of inclusion. Those that focus on the 'soft' disciplines, with few formulae, are relegated to the low-ranking journals.

The products of the algebra-loving factories, products in terms of both ideas and trained disciples, are now powerfully positioned throughout the world. Not only were the disciples hired by banks, but these kind of thinkers were also recruited by the very best central banks, regulatory agencies, credit rating agencies and think tanks. The brightest of them gradually learn to moderate the stances they were taught at their prestigious *alma mater*, and increasingly become more multifaceted, multi-disciplinary. After all, they know from their own family life and simple observation on the street that people do not obey mathematical rules or the economist model. Or at least not consistently. Those trained as economists have a greater opportunity to become more disciplinary-inclusive than the mathematicians hired straight into the financial centres. These poor souls have less time than the economists to see the place of mathematics in a wider perspective.

Maths, it has to be acknowledged, is a useful tool, but only one tool among many. Charlie Munger, a great investor and a great thinker, says that we should beware of 'a man with a hammer' because such a man sees every problem as a nail. The rocket scientists hired by the banks and those that rely on them (supposedly overseeing them) should have more intellectual tools in the toolbox, ranging from the idea of the madness of crowds to the psychological effect of an incentive system.

Here I provide two brief examples of the over-reliance on simplistic models to make billion (or trillion) dollar decisions. You may detect a few more instances later in the chapter where models fail to capture the complex of human-driven decision making as I run through the events of 2007 and 2008.

# Example 16.1 Modelling default rates on securitised loans and bonds

David Li wrote a paper that was published in the Journal of Fixed Income in 2000. This was very influential because it provided a neat model for pricing CDOs. These are explained in much more detail later, but for now you need to know that they are a kind of securitised bond (see Chapter 6), with the security being provided by debts owed, usually mortgage debt. Thus the holders of mortgage-based CDOs ultimately receive a return from the repayment of monthly mortgage amounts and borrowers redeeming their mortgages. I say 'ultimately' because CDOs were often (mostly) constructed from other securitised bonds, which get their income from mortgage payers.

The right to receive this flow of income needed to be valued, so that the holders, which were generally banks as well as some other financial institutions, could value their assets and estimate profits made over a period. The value of debt owed to you depends on the likelihood of the borrowers defaulting. David Li provided a formula useful for estimating CDO value without having to establish the likelihood of repayment from each of the thousands of mortgage payers. His short cut was to use the market prices of credit default swaps, CDSs (see Chapter 11) and the prices of bonds, that relate to that CDO. Now that investment bankers had a quick and easy way of valuing CDOs they could really go to town selling them and holding them on their balance sheets. From virtually nothing in 2000 the market grew to issue over  $550 billion of CDOs per year by 2006, and had more than$ 4,700 billion outstanding (for comparison, UK annual GDP is around $2,000 billion and the total balance sheet capital of any nation's banks are far less). The CDS market was also boosted from under $1,000 billion of outstanding CDSs in 2000 to over 62,000 billion in 2007 (more than the output of goods and services for the entire world for one year).

It was not just the investment banks that adopted the formula; bond investors took comfort from it when deciding how much to invest, as did commercial banks from around the world who piled into US CDOs to obtain the high yield they were offering. Even more worrying, the rating agencies and the financial regulators used the model.

The limitations of the formula were available for scrutiny, but few bothered to look as they excitedly booked 'profits' (and bonuses) from creating, dealing and holding CDOs. The problem was that these reported profits were largely illusory because they failed to take account of the true risk. The inputs to the formula relied on obtaining numbers for default rates and the correlation between two or more credit risks, such as between two or more asset-backed securitised bonds held by a CDO. The mathematicians naturally measured these default rates and correlations over recent years and assumed that these were the relevant numbers for future-orientated estimations. They assumed that correlation was constant rather than volatile, ignoring the warnings of leading statisticians and experienced derivative dealers that asset prices can switch from low correlation to being very highly correlated when prices are falling across the board. The problem was that the early and mid-2000s were unusually benign for mortgage holders. Interest rates were down to very low levels and house prices were on a rising trend, and so very few defaulted. There was also low correlation between defaults – it was rare for all the different housing markets in America to be down at the same time, or so they thought.

You cannot blame the mathematicians, they are not trained to have the wider, longer-history perspective. They do formulas and calculations, not the soft stuff. Even if the mathematicians had qualms about the model's limitations; they had bosses who wanted to hold more and more CDOs, CDSs, etc. because they seemed so profitable. The problem is the bosses did not understand the maths and how the model worked – a single correlation number came out of the end of a black-box computer calculation and that was enough for them to punt a billion or two of the company's money. Thus we had a position where the balance sheet values of trillions of dollars worth of financial instruments were dependent on the assumption of a continuing benign housing market. When house prices stopped rising and defaults increased the value of CDOs fell.

Why did the credit rating agencies rate CDOs at low default risk, despite the obvious dangers in the assumptions? Well, that is another story (one that will be addressed later in the chapter). Hint: they made a lot of money from rating CDOs. They also employed a lot of algebra lovers. For now here is a comment from Kai Gilkes, who worked for ten years at rating agencies: 'Everyone was pinning their hopes on house prices continuing to rise. When they stopped rising, pretty much everyone was caught on the wrong side, because the sensitivity to house prices was huge … Why didn't rating agencies build in some cushion for this sensitivity to a house-price-depreciation scenario? Because if they had, they would have never rated a single mortgage-backed CDO.'4

To be fair to David Li, he did try to warn people that it was false reassurance to assume that correlations on default were always going to remain the same as they had been in the benign conditions of the late 1990s and early 2000s: 'Very few people understand the essence of the model … The most dangerous part is when people believe everything coming out of it.'[5] As so often with these models the originators provide plenty of warnings and provisos, but somehow the bankers and other followers tend to ignore them or fail to understand the subtleties.

# Example 16.2 Modelling daily value at risk

Banks hold a very wide range of assets, from corporate loans to complicated derivatives, and they bear a number of obligations. Senior managers of banks can lose track as to the extent to which the firm as a whole is exposed to risk. One division might be building up large holdings of bonds while another is selling credit default swaps, and yet another is packaging up mortgage bonds and selling CDOs. Perhaps what one division is doing will offset the risk that another is taking on. On the other hand, it might be that risk is merely compounded by the combination of positions. Each day the mix of assets and liabilities changes and therefore the risk exposure changes.

Back in the 1990s some bankers thought it would be a good idea to produce a single number that encapsulated the overall risk profile of the bank each evening. The senior managers could look at that and be reassured that they were not taking excessive risk. If the number started to look dangerously high then they could instruct a reweighting of assets and obligations until a safety margin was restored. The measure that they came up with is called value at risk, or VaR, which asks: 'If tomorrow is a bad day (e.g. different asset classes, such as shares and bonds, fall in market price significantly), what is the minimum that the bank will lose?' VaR is an estimate of the loss on a portfolio over a period of time (usually 24 hours is chosen) that will be exceeded with a given frequency, e.g. a frequency of one day out of 100, or five days out of 100. Another way of looking at the frequency element is called the confidence level. Thus with a 99 per cent confidence level set the VaR might turn out to be $100 million. Therefore for 'one-day VaR' there is a 1 per cent chance that the portfolio could lose more than $100 million in 24 hours. A 95 per cent confidence level means that there is a 95 per cent chance that the loss will be less than the derived figure of say $16 million for a day, and a 5 per cent chance that it will be greater than $16 million

So, how does a bank calculate VaR estimates? They need some numbers and some assumptions. One assumption often made is that returns on a security (share, derivative, bond, etc.) follow a particular distribution. The usual assumption is the normal distribution where there is a large clustering of probabilities of returns around the average expected return and then very small probabilities of the extremes ('thin tails'). Also, the distribution of possible outturns is symmetrical about the mean - there is the same chance of being, say, £3 million above the average expected return as being £3 million below it - see Exhibit 16.1 for a normal distribution of probabilities, a bell-shaped symmetrical curve. The usual source of data, whether combined with a normal distribution assumption or not, is a long time series of an historical data set of daily return data for the securities - then the mathematicians assume that this represents the future distribution of returns. Another important source of information is the calculation of the extent to which asset returns move together. Then it is assumed that these correlations remain true for future estimations.

Exhibit 16.1 shows a possible output from using VaR. On the right-hand side the return numbers increase but the probability of earning those high returns decreases significantly the further we move away from the average expected return. The probabilities for returns below average are symmetrical with those above average in this case where we assume 'normality'. (If we used real past return data the distribution may not be quite normal and the maths for calculating the confidence level becomes more complicated, but it can still be handled. Skewed distribution just creates more fun for the mathematicians.) You can read off the 99 per cent chance of not losing more than the amount marked by the red line. If the red line is at  $100 million then one day out of 100 we would lose more than$ 100m, in theory.

A key assumption is that the past data has a very close bearing on the future probabilities. Even using the normality method you need past data to estimate the size of the various probabilities. So, you might gather data from the previous three or five years. If unusual/infrequent events are not present in that dataset you might be missing some extreme positive or negative possibilities.

Exhibit 16.1 A VaR analysis assuming a normal distribution of the probabilities of return on an asset or collection of assets

One of these events might have a massive impact on risk but might be missed if the data set is limited to a period of stability. Indeed it might be missed even if the dataset is extensive if the event is very rare. An influential writer on derivatives and market player, Nicolas Taleb, $^{8}$  was warning us long before the crisis that the mathematicians were not allowing for the possibility of extreme events (called black swans) – that the tails of the distribution are in fact much bigger, 'fatter', than generally supposed, because extreme things hit us more often then we anticipate. There are 'high-impact rare events', often caused by human reactions to apparently insignificant triggers; reactions such as exuberance, fear and panic. Asset returns and liabilities which appeared to be uncorrelated suddenly all move together to a much greater extent than short-memory players in financial markets expect. There are risks out there that we did not know existed, until it is too late. The more experienced old hands know that unexpected and unimaginable events shape the markets, leaving them with question marks concerning the extent to which they can trust historical data to be the only guide.

VaR led many senior bankers into a false sense of security prior to the crisis. They were thus emboldened to double and triple their bets on securities such as mortgage CDOs because they appeared to produce high profits without raising VaR much. Many regulators insisted on the disclosure of VaR. Indeed, under the Basel capital rules for banks VaR could be used as an argument for lowering capital requirements. Banks jumped at the chance of lowering capital buffers so as to increase return on equity (see Chapters 2 and 7) – they leveraged themselves up. They particularly liked to stock up on 'high-quality' mortgage-based CDOs because the model told them that they had trivial VaR and so they were required to hold only trivial capital reserves. Yes, the regulators have much to answer for, too. They placed far too much faith in these mathematical models. They even allowed banks to do their own calculations of risk exposure, and more or less accepted that for setting capital limits.

Prior to the summer of 2007 banks tended to use historical evidence going back between one and five years to estimate VaR. By then a large part of their exposure was to the mortgage market. In the mid-2000s this had been as placid as the sea was when the Titanic was crossing the Atlantic – no trouble encountered for day after day. It would seem that VaR gave little indication of real likely losses. For example, in the autumn of 2007 Bear Stearns reported an average VaR of  $30\mathrm{m},$  which is tiny for a bank with so many assets. It could withstand days and days of such losses and barely notice. So according to VaR it was hardly at risk at all. And yet within weeks it was bust, losing  $\$8,000$  million of value. As the complete failure of the bank approached, the VaR number did rise slightly to  $\$60$  million because it started to incorporate data for the more recent days when securities became more volatile as the market mayhem started – but it still had lots of older placid data pushing the number down. It turned out that 'highly unlikely events' such as a correlated fall in house prices all over the US, and the fall in market prices of derivatives and bonds can all happen at the same time. The average man on the street could have told them that, but these mathematicians and financial economists could not see past their complex algebra. The guys over at Merrill Lynch were perplexed: 'In the past these AAA CDO securities had never experienced a significant loss in value.'[10] But how long was that 'past' – if they could find a decade of data they would have been lucky, because these instruments were so young. As the crisis got under way most of the large banks experienced day after day losses that should only happen once in 1,000 years (according to their models). In their language these were six-sigma (standard deviation) events, which were virtually impossible from their faithful-to-the-algebra perspective. Indeed, in August 2007 the market experienced several 25-sigma events – these should happen only once every 14 billion years, that is, since the Big Bang! How confusing for them – the model let them down when it really mattered. Triana (2009) likens VaR to buying a car with an air bag which protects you 99 per cent of the time, that is when conditions are moderate, but if you have a serious crash it fails.

Bear Stearns understood the problems with VaR. Take this statement from their filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 29 February 2008:

VaR has inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data, which may not accurately predict future market risk, and the quantitative risk information generated is limited by the parameters established in creating the models. There can be no assurance that actual losses occurring on any one day arising from changes in market conditions will not exceed the VaR amounts shown below or that such losses will not occur more than once in 20 trading days. VaR is not likely to accurately predict exposures in markets that exhibit sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions or established trading relationships. Many of the Company's hedging strategies are structured around likely established trading relationships and, consequently, those hedges may not be effective and VaR models may not accurately predict actual results. Furthermore, VaR calculated for a one-day horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated in a one-day period.[11]

Despite this list of doubts they had used it because everyone else did (and the regulators allowed them to get away with it):

However, the Company believes VaR models are an established methodology for the quantification of risk in the financial services industry despite these limitations. VaR is best used in conjunction with other financial disclosures in order to assess the Company's risk profile.[12]

Being 'established' is not the same as being best suited to the task. They are basically saying: 'If all the other fellas are using it to leverage up profits and bonuses, why can't we?' This is not very scientific, no matter how much algebra you use to bamboozle.

Once faith in VaR had evaporated those lending to banks became afraid that the risk metrics they publicly announced under-reported their real exposure. They took the action that you or I would take when told that borrowers might default on what they owe: stop lending any more and try to call in old loans. The problem is the entire banking system was a complex web of loans to each other and once confidence had gone the whole system collapsed. Notice the key words here are not quantifiable – 'afraid', 'confidence' – these fuzzy things are just as important to understand about finance as the maths, if not more so.

# Reflexivity

George Soros is the most famous and the most respected of the hedge fund managers, who made a fortune for himself and the backers of his Quantum Fund. However, his first love and abiding passion is economic philosophy. Indeed, it is his understanding of the importance of human thought on market prices that made him and his investors so much money. At the heart of his ideas is reflexivity in markets, in which the behaviour of market prices results from a two-way feedback mechanism with participants (e.g. investors) moving prices and fundamentals in response to their (faulty) perceptions, and their perceptions, in turn, formed by market movements and fundamentals. Knowledge of this human tendency can help identify bubbles and irrational downward spirals.

Early in life Soros developed his philosophy of how people in social structures operate as a group to occasionally lead the economic (or political or social) fundamentals away from a near-to-equilibrium state to a far-from-equilibrium state. His observations and anticipations of financial market movements are but a sub-set of manifestations of his theory of 'reflexivity'. The same philosophical base can be used to describe and analyse, for example, the movement of a society from an open, rule-of-law, democratic form to one increasingly closed and authoritarian. It can also be used to describe and explain individual human interactions such as love and hate, amongst a host of other applications.

In contrast to the 'rational man model' assumed by most economists Soros observed that decisions are based on people's perception or interpretation of the situation. Furthermore, their decisions can change the situation, alter the fundamentals (e.g. the price of houses in a country or the price of dot.com shares). Then changes in the fundamentals thus caused are liable to change the perceptions of individuals. And so on.

Soros was born in Hungary in 1930. Living under both Nazi and Communist regimes gave Soros a healthy respect for the objective aspect of reality. His experiences of living in the farfrom-equilibrium conditions of first the German and then the Russian occupation of his country provided insight which played an important role in preparing him for a successful career as a hedge fund manager. He, more than most, became aware that stability is a commodity that comes and goes.

When admitted to the London School of Economics he chose to study economics but quickly found it a trial for two reasons: (i) he was poor at maths, and economics was increasingly becoming a mathematical discipline; and (ii) he was more interested in addressing the foundations of economics, such as the assumptions of perfect knowledge, while his teachers preferred algebraic constructs built on such time-honoured assumptions.

The bright spots in his university experience were his encounters with Professor Karl Popper, who supplied inspiring ideas and engaged with Soros seriously.

Karl Popper … maintained that reason is not capable of establishing the truth of generalisations beyond doubt. Even scientific laws cannot be verified because it is impossible to derive universally valid generalisations from individual observations, however numerous, by deductive logic. Scientific method works best by adopting an attitude of comprehensive scepticism: Scientific laws should be treated as hypotheses which are provisionally valid unless and until they are falsified … He asserted that scientific laws cannot be verified … One nonconforming instance may be sufficient to destroy the validity of the generalisation, but no amount of conforming instances are sufficient to verify a generalisation beyond any doubt.[13]

The economists' need to maintain the assumption of perfect knowledge on the part of economic actors directly contradicted Popper's contention that understanding by humans is inherently imperfect. Yet economists kept trying to create a discipline with generalisations comparable with those of Isaac Newton in physics, resulting in a discipline increasingly convoluted and mathematical.

In rejecting the standard economists' model and influenced by Popper, Soros started developing a framework of human behaviour in which misconceptions and misinterpretations play a major role in shaping the course of history. Market participants do not base their decisions on knowledge alone because biased perceptions have a powerful impact not only on market prices but also the fundamentals that those prices are supposed to reflect. Note for now the two influences of biased perceptions – many readers of Soros' work only take on board the first and thus glibly conclude that he is not saying anything particularly original – the original bit is the second element.

First element: influencing market prices.

Second element: influencing the fundamentals those prices are supposed to reflect.

# Classical economics

The Enlightenment view of the world is that reality lies there, passively waiting to be discovered. Reason acts as a searchlight to illuminate that reality. Thus, there is a separation between, on the one hand, people's thoughts and understanding of the world and, on the other, the object. The thinking agents cannot influence the underlying reality. Thus in natural science we can explain and predict the course of events with reasonable certainty.

Economic and other social areas of 'study' - Soros does not permit the use of the word 'science' with social disciplines - tried to imitate Newtonian physics and develop 'laws' to describe the fundamental processes. To make their models work in a 'scientific' manner economists would simplify reality by making assumptions, for example, that market participants base their decisions on perfect knowledge, or that supply and demand curves could be taken as independently given (with supply not influencing demand, and demand not influencing supply, except through the classical interaction on the economist's diagram).

For the physical scientists it is obvious that to gain knowledge there must be a separation between thoughts and their objective. The facts must be independent of the statements made about them. So, the Earth will move around the Sun in a fairly predictable pattern regardless of what the observer thinks about the movement. Many economists follow a sequence of logic analogous to the physics model in trying to describe economic outcomes - see Exhibit 16.2.

# Exhibit 16.2 Classical economics

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/2bed7361615ae1b171f864b9392b4f4205ed3eeddca38a99a04c2d0e7fa5d037.jpg)

When we move away from the physical sciences we frequently encounter a problem. In social phenomena it is often difficult to separate fact from thoughts. The decision maker in trying to make sense of the world attempts to be a detached observer, but can never fully overcome the fact that they are part of the situation they seek to comprehend. For example, people and human organisations, such as lending institutions, try to understand the underlying facts about the housing market, but in doing so – and in taking action – they influence the reality of the house supply, demand and prices. Under the classical economics paradigm demand and supply curves are supposed to determine the market price. But it seems reasonable to suggest that in many cases these curves are themselves subject to market influences, in which case prices cease to be uniquely determined. We end up with fluctuating prices rather than equilibrium.

Another example: It is thought that the markets are on the look-out for a recession looming over the horizon, that they anticipate it. Soros takes a different viewpoint, believing that it is more correct to say that markets help to precipitate recessions; that:

1 Markets are always biased in one direction or another.

2 Markets can influence the events they anticipate.

For example, it would be difficult to argue that the reaction of the financial markets to news coming out of the US residential mortgage market in 2008 did not influence events to take us into recession.

# Soros' paradigm

So, the widely held paradigm that financial markets tend toward equilibrium is both false and misleading. Soros contends that, first, financial markets never reflect underlying reality accurately and, second, occasionally, these distortions affect the fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. These ideas provide profound insight into both the setting of prices and the movement of underlyings. Market participants' misconceptions, misunderstandings and misjudgments affect market prices and, more importantly, market prices affect the fundamentals.

The economists' classic model does allow for deviations from the theoretical equilibrium, but only in a random manner, and the deviations will be corrected in a fairly short time frame. Soros says that market prices do not reach the theoretical equilibrium point; they are in a continual state of change relative to the theoretical equilibrium.

The role of perceptions is key to understanding reflexivity. Participants in the financial markets have expectations about events. These expectations affect the shapes of both the supply and the demand curves. Decisions to buy or to sell an asset are based on expectations about future prices and future prices are, in turn, contingent on buy or sell decisions in the present.

The assets that are currently rising in price often attract buyers, whereas those that are falling encourage more sales – self-reinforcing trends. Anyone who has spent time in the financial markets becomes aware that reinforcing trends exist. Soros asks rhetorically: How could self-reinforcing trends persist if supply and demand curves were independent of market prices?

The act of thinking by market participants has a dual role. On the one hand, they are trying to understand the situation; on the other, their understanding (or misunderstanding) produces actions which influence the course of events. The two roles interfere with each other. The participants' imperfect understanding leads to actions and the course of events bears the imprint of that imperfection.

The term reflexive comes from a feature of the French language, where the subject and the object is the same. It also means reflection (not reflexes).

We are all taught to think in terms of events as a sequence of facts – one set of facts leads to another set of facts, and so on, in a never-ending chain. However, this is not how the part of the world affected by humans actually works. The facts are first subject to the participants' thinking, then the participants' thinking connects to the next set of facts. As can be seen in Exhibit 16.3, market participants look at the fundamentals through a fog of misconceptions, misunderstandings and misjudgments. They have biased perceptions. In trying to understand – 'the cognitive function' – they make mistakes. In their biased state they then take action – 'the manipulative function' – and this moves market prices.

So far, so conventional: standard economics allows for the less well-informed actors to make misinterpretations and poor decisions because markets are not perfect, and for them to do so as a herd. Soros' insight is that, rather than a return to theoretical equilibrium as the participants realise their errors (or the errors are merely part of a large set of off-setting random events), the distortions in market prices create distortions in the fundamentals – the 'prevailing trend' itself is altered – and simultaneously the perceptions of participants is altered in response to the fundamentals changing, resulting in an indeterminate outcome, as perceptions feed off the course of events and the course of events feeds off perceptions. We get indeterminacy in both the cognitive and manipulating functions because of the reflexive connection between them.

In most cases the reflexive interaction is relatively insignificant because there are forces at play that bring thinking and reality together, such as people learning from experience or new evidence

Exhibit 16.3 A two-way reflexive connection between perception and reality coming to light. These are termed 'near-equilibrium conditions' and the impact of reflexivity can be disregarded. In these cases classical economic theory applies, and the divergence between perceptions and reality can be ignored as mere noise.

Occasionally, however, the reflexive interaction can lead to massive market distortions, with no tendency for them to come together – 'far-from-equilibrium conditions' – leading to boom/ bust sequences. In this case the theories developed around the assumption of equilibrium become irrelevant. We are presented with a one-directional process in which changes in both perceptions and reality are irreversible (at least for a period). Just as mutation has a role in biology so misconceptions and mistakes play a role in human affairs.

When thinking about Exhibit 16.3 try to picture the stages presented following one another so quickly that the whole thing becomes a blur of concurrently occurring (and cross-impacting) cognitive function, manipulative function, market prices and fundamentals. People taking decisions make an impact on the situation (the manipulative function), which changes the situation, which is liable to change their perceptions (the cognitive function). 'The two functions operate concurrently, not sequentially. If the feedback were sequential, it would produce a uniquely determined sequence leading from facts to perceptions to new facts and then new perceptions, and so on. It is the fact that the two processes occur simultaneously that creates an indeterminacy in both the participants' perceptions and the actual course of events.' $^{14}$

If we take the stock market, for example, we observe that people trade shares in anticipation of future prices, but those prices are contingent on the investors' expectations. We cannot assume that expectations in the market is a form of knowledge in the same way that a physical scientist can predict the motions of the stars – the movement of the stars is truly independent of the expectations of the scientist. In the absence of knowledge, participants bring in an element of judgement or bias into their decision making. Thus, outcomes diverge from expectations.

Soros uses 'equilibrium' as a figure of speech. He does not see a stable equilibrium from which deviates the occasional boom/bust process. Equilibrium should be seen as a moving target because market prices get buffeted by the fundamentals they are supposed to reflect.

Example of a reflexive statement outside of finance: 'You are my enemy.' Whether this is true or not depends on how you react to it. It is indeterminate.

Example of an act of the manipulative function that failed to achieve the outcome intended: President George W. Bush declared a War on Terror and used it to invade Iraq on false pretenses.

The outcome was the exact opposite of what he intended: He wanted to demonstrate American supremacy and garner political support in the process; but he caused a precipitous decline in American power and influence and lost political support in the process.[15]

# Bubbles

Soros sees bubbles as consisting of two components:

1 a trend based on reality;

2 a misconception or misinterpretation of that trend.

Usually financial markets correct misconceptions, but, occasionally misconceptions can lead to the inflation of a bubble. This happens when the misconception reinforces the prevailing trend. Then a two-way feedback might occur in which the prevailing trend, now puffed up by the initial misconception, then reinforces the misconception. Then the gap between reality and the market's interpretation of reality can grow and grow. In maintaining the growth in the gap the participants' bias needs a short circuit so that it can continue to affect the fundamentals. This is usually provided by some form of leveraged debt or equity.

At some point the size of the gap becomes so large that it is unsustainable. The misconception is recognised for what it is, and participants become disillusioned. The trend is reversed. As asset prices fall the value of collateral that supported much of the loans for the purchases melts away, causing margin calls and distress selling. Eventually, there is an overshoot in the other direction.

The boom/bust sequence is asymmetrical. It slowly inflates and accelerates, followed by a more rapid reversal. Soros says that there are eight stages to the boom/bust sequence. We will take the example where the underlying trend is earnings per share ('the prevailing trend') and the participants' perceptions (cognitive function) are reflected in share prices through the manipulative function, i.e. they buy or sell shares pushing the prices up or down. In turn, the change in share prices may affect both the participants' bias and the underlying trend.

Thus, share prices are determined by two factors:

(a) the underlying trend - earnings per share, eps;

(b) the prevailing bias.

Both (a) and (b) are influenced by share prices, hence a feedback loop.

In Exhibit 16.4 the divergence between the two curves is an indication of the underlying bias. (Soros said that the true relationship is more complex than we are representing here because the earnings curve includes, as well as the underlying trend, the influence of share prices on that trend. Thus the prevailing bias is expressed only partially by the divergence between the two curves – it is also partially already reflected in those curves.)

# Stage 1 - no trend recognition

The underlying trend is gently sloping upwards, but is not yet recognised.

# Stage 2 – recognising the trend and reinforcement

The trend is recognised by market participants. This changes perceptions about the underlying. The newly developing positive prevailing bias pushes shares along. At this stage the change in share prices may or may not affect the underlying trend, i.e. the level of earnings of companies. If it does not then the reflexive boom does not materialise – the correction in share prices leads to the loss of the underlying trend, i.e. eps do not continue to rise abnormally.

If the underlying trend is affected by the rise in share prices then we have the beginning of a self-reinforcing process, and we start to move into a far-from-equilibrium state. The underlying trend becomes increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias and the bias becomes increasingly exaggerated.

# Exhibit 16.4 The boom/bust model

# Stage 3 - testing

Both the prevailing bias and the trend are tested by external shocks – there may be several tests, but here we show only one. Prices suffer setbacks. If the test causes the bias and trend to fail to survive then the potential bubble dies.

# Stage 4 - period of acceleration

Survival through the tests makes both the bias and the trend stronger. The underlying trend (eps) becomes increasingly influenced by share prices. Also the rise in share prices becomes increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias. Both the bias and the trend become seemingly unshakable. Conviction is so strong that share price rises are no longer affected by setbacks in the earning trend. Now far-from-equilibrium conditions become firmly established – the normal rules no longer apply.

# Stage 5 - unsustainability

Exaggerated expectations reach such a peak that reality can no longer sustain them. This is 'the moment of truth'.

# Stage 6 - twilight period

Participants realise that their prevailing bias is high and they lower their expectations. The trend may be sustained by inertia, but is no longer reinforced by belief, so it rises at a lower rate. This is the twilight period or period of stagnation – people no longer believe in the game, but continue to play.

# Stage 7 - tipping point

The loss of belief eventually causes a reversal in the trend that had become ever more dependent on an ever stronger bias. When the trend reverses we have the crossover or tipping point.

# Stage 8 - catastrophic downward acceleration

A downward trend reinforces the now negative prevailing bias – the gap between share price, as a reflection of expectations, and the eps levels is now negative. A crash occurs. Eventually the pessimism goes too far and the market stabilises.

# Reflexivity does not follow a predetermined pattern

Soros emphasises that this is only one possible path resulting from the interplay of a trend and a prevailing bias. Some far-from-equilibrium reflexive situations follow this pattern of initial self-reinforcement, unsustainability of the gap between thinking and reality, followed by collapse, creating a historically significant event. But there are also reflexive interactions that correct themselves before they reach boom proportions, and thus do not become historically significant. There is nothing determinate or compulsory about the boom/bust pattern. The process may be aborted at any time. Also, there are many other processes going on at the same time, e.g. changes in other asset markets, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in the political or social environment. The various processes may interfere with one another leading to boom/bust sequences being hit by external shocks. There may be patterns that tend to repeat themselves in far-from-equilibrium situations, but the actual course of events is indeterminate and unique.

# Applying reflexivity to the crisis

The housing bubble of the 2000s is a sub-part of a much larger super-bubble that stretches back to the early 1980s.

# Housing bubble

The US housing bubble followed the course described by Soros' in his boom/bust model. Lax lending standards were supported by a prevailing misconception that the value of the collateral for the loans was not affected by the willingness to lend. Loans were packaged up into financial securities and sold on to unsuspecting investors around the world. Those securitised bonds issued in the early stages of the boom showed a low default rate on the underlying mortgages. Credit rating agencies based their estimates of future default rates on the recent benign past – another misconception. As house prices rose the rating agencies became even more relaxed as they rated collateralised debt obligations. In trying to perceive future risks and returns all participants failed to recognise the impact that they, themselves, made.

While Wall Street was creating all these weird and obscure financial instruments – and getting fat fees for arranging them – mortgage originators became increasingly aggressive in encouraging ordinary people to take on the responsibilities of a mortgage. The value of a loan as a proportion of the value of a house got higher and higher. Towards the end of the boom people who had no job and nothing to put down as a deposit on a house were being granted mortgages. The attraction of fee income lies at the heart of this. The mortgage arrangers received a fee for arranging the mortgage regardless of what happened to the house owner thereafter; the banks received fees for arranging securitised bonds, and yet more fees for CDOs, and yet more fees for even more complex instruments.

But all of this was okay if you believed that the value of homes and thus collateral for the loans, was growing and would continue to grow. This belief, for a while, created its own fulfilment: faith in the housing market led to more loans; the additional demand for housing stimulated by the availability of cheap mortgages led to house prices rising, providing more collateral; confidence in the housing market rose due to the additional collateral and low rates of default on mortgages because home owners could easily refinance in a rising market to avoid default; more loans were forthcoming; and so on.

People became dependent on double-digit house price rises to finance their lifestyles. As they withdrew housing 'equity' through remortgages the savings rate dropped below zero. When home owners became over-extended and house prices stopped rising they had to cut back on remortgaging. There was a reduction in demand from both people moving and from people staying put and remortgaging. The moment of truth came in the spring of 2007 when New Century Financial Corp. went into bankruptcy. People started to ask questions: perhaps the value of the collateral for mortgages was not destined to rise for ever and was artificially supported by the willingness of lenders to make fresh loans. If they stopped, perhaps much of the 'value' in houses would prove to be an illusion.

A twilight period followed when house prices were falling but participants continued to play the game – new mortgages were signed and securitisations created. In August 2007 there was a significant acceleration in downward price movements. Over the next year contagion spread from one segment of financial markets to another, until Lehman's collapse sparked a further downward lunge.

# The super-bubble

The super-bubble also reached its tipping point in 2007-2008. This reflexive process evolved over a period of a quarter of a century. The main prevailing trend was ever more sophisticated methods of credit expansion, supported by the trend to globalisation and the trend towards the removal of regulations with increasing financial innovation.

The prevailing misconception was 'market fundamentalism', which promotes the notion that markets should be free to find their own level with very little intervention by regulators. Market fundamentalism became a guiding principle in the financial system in the early 1980s.

The long-term boom combined three major trends, each of which contained at least one defect.

# Trend 1 - ever increasing credit expansion

The long-term credit expansion was manifest in rising consumer loan to value of asset (house) ratios and the expansion of credit as a percentage of GDP. This trend has been helped along by the authorities' response to any sign of economic downturn or threat to the banking system. Learning lessons from the Great Depression they were quick to stimulate the economy through countercyclical lower interest rates or loose fiscal policy, and if anything endangered the banks there would be bail-outs.

After a few years of intervention the participants started to think there was an asymmetry to the risk of credit expansion. If they expand credit (lower lending standards) and things go right, then the lenders are the winners. If they expand and things go wrong, then they will be bailed out by the authorities. This is an example of the moral hazard problem, in which the presence of a safety net encourages adverse behaviour.

High levels of leverage became normal. Indeed, banks, hedge funds and private equity firms thrived on it. Credit terms for car loans, credit card debt, commercial loans as well as mortgages all reached absurdly easy levels. Japan was another source of credit expansion. During its grindingly long recession it held interest rates near to zero. This encouraged the 'carry trade': international financial institutions borrow in yen and invest the borrowed funds elsewhere in the world at higher yields. The US was not alone. The love of leverage infected other economies from the UK to Spain.

# Trend 2 - globalisation of financial markets

The process of globalisation of financial markets accelerated with the petro-dollar recycling in the 1970s, but it got a significant boost with Thatcherism and Reaganism in the 1980s. They saw globalisation of financial markets as a useful development because freeing up financial capital to move around the world makes it difficult for any state to intervene, to tax capital or to regulate it because it can evade such moves by transferring somewhere else. Financial capital was promoted to a privileged position. Governments often have to put the aspirations of their people in second place behind the requirements of international capital – we saw this in 2010–2011 with the Eurozone financial crisis as governments desperate to impress the financial markets with their stewardship of the economy cut budget deficits. The market fundamentalists, who dominated political and financial thinking in the quarter century until the 2007 crisis, thought that taking our lead from the markets was a good thing.

According to the market fundamentalists, globalisation was to bring about a level playing field. In reality, the international financial system ended up in the hands of a consortium of financial authorities answerable to the developed countries. The whole system has favoured the US and the other developed countries at the centre of the financial system, while penalising the developing economies at the periphery. The 'Washington consensus' (IMF, World Bank, etc.) sought to impose strict market discipline on individual less developed countries if they ran into difficulties. But when the western financial system is threatened, the rules are bent.

Furthermore, the US has the benefit of the dollar being the main international reserve currency, accepted by central banks around the world – these organisations, such as the central bank of China, would often invest current account surpluses in US government and agency bonds. This permitted the US to intervene in markets to counter its downturns and financial crises – inflating credit – while other countries were forced to live within their means. Also, it was safer to hold assets at the centre, and thus the US sucked up the savings of the world as US consumers went on a spending spree. Perversely capital flowed from the less developed world to the US.

# Trend 3 - progressive removal of financial regulations and the accelerating pace of financial innovation

Between the end of the Second World War and the early 1980s banks and markets were strictly regulated. President Reagan, however, would refer to the 'magic of the marketplace', especially after market fundamentalism received a significant fillip from the manifest failures of communism and other forms of state intervention. An amazing array of new financial instruments was invented and many were widely adopted. The more complicated the financial system became, the less participants and regulators could understand what was going on.

Periodic financial crises over the quarter century (such as the Long Term Capital Asset Management crisis, the dot.com bubble crash, the 2001 terrorist attack) served as tests of the prevailing trend and the prevailing misconception. When these tests were passed, the trend and the misconception were reinforced. Progressively, in an atmosphere of laissez-faire, the authorities lost control of the financial system and the super-bubble developed.

The US housing bubble brought the super-bubble to a point of unsustainability – both the trends and the misconceptions became unsustainable; then a tipping point was reached for both bubbles, with the sub-prime crises acting merely as a trigger that released the unwinding of the super-bubble.

The flaw in the market fundamentalist view is that just because state intervention is subject to error does not mean that markets are perfect.

The cardinal contention of the theory of reflexivity is that all human constructs are flawed. Financial markets do not necessarily tend towards equilibrium; left to their own devices they are liable to go to extremes of euphoria and despair. For that reason they are not left to their own devices; they have been put in the charge of financial authorities whose job it is to supervise them and regulate them … The belief that markets tend towards equilibrium is directly responsible for the current turmoil; it encouraged the regulators to abandon their responsibility and rely on the market mechanism to correct its own excesses.[17]

# Some of the more proximate causes of the crisis

The decade leading up to 2008 was unprecedented in terms of innovation in the financial markets. But alongside some good innovations there was an out-of-control complexity, combined with ignorance and misaligned incentives.

# Low interest rates

The September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center led to a loss of confidence which compounded the cautiousness of consumers and investors following the dot.com bust of 2000. Recession and deflation were a possibility and so interest rates were lowered in the West. In the US, short-term rates stayed around 1 per cent between 2002 and 2004. Deflation did not occur and the rate of interest was frequently less than the inflation rate. Interest rates were further lowered by the huge amount of Chinese savings being invested in US government Treasury bills and bonds.

Low interest rates encouraged a boom in house prices and in economic output. Low interest rates also led to a 'search for yield': investors and bankers, discontented with low returns on deposits and safe investments, became prepared to accept more risk to obtain higher rates of return.

# Innovation in the mortgage market

In the US, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were at the centre of mortgage securitisation at the start of the 1990s. They bought bundles of mortgages from mortgage originators (e.g. banks) and then created and sold mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), a type of asset-backed security (ABS) (see Chapter 11). The GSEs guaranteed the interest and principle on these MBSs. And given that the government was likely to rescue its creations if they ran into trouble, a guarantee from the GSEs was taken to be as good as a guarantee from the US Treasury.

The GSEs would not take just any old mortgage. They usually insisted that the house owner owed no more than 80 per cent of the value of the house (loan-to-value ratio, LTV) and the maximum size of mortgage was 417,000. They also investigated the borrower's income, state of employment, history of bad debts (if any) and amounts of other assets. In other words, this system is pretty safe because only the most creditworthy enter it. It was for 'prime' mortgages only.

Now for some innovation. In the early 1990s new lenders emerged who were willing to lend to people who did not qualify as prime borrowers. They would often employ independent firms of mortgage brokers to persuade families to take out a mortgage. The brokers received a commission for each one sold. The number of sub-prime lenders grew significantly over the 12 years to 2005 and the proportion of mortgages that were sub-prime rose to over 20 per cent. The rise of this market attracted the interest of the big names on Wall Street (e.g. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns and Morgan Stanley), which bought up sub-prime lenders. These borrowers could be charged higher interest rates than prime borrowers. They could also be charged large fees for setting up the loan. The sub-prime market boomed. By 2005 the largest US mortgage provider was the sub-prime lender Countrywide Financial, which had grown fast from 1980s obscurity.

A key characteristic of the new lenders is that they lent at different interest rates to different groups of mortgagees classified on the basis of likelihood-of-default statistical models. These relied heavily on the borrower's credit score. These scores were calculated by examining a number of borrower characteristics, the most important of which became the absence (or low incidence) of missed or delayed payments on previous debts. The statisticians had discovered a high correlation between credit scores and defaults on mortgages in the 1990s and so it made sense to them to carry on with them in the 2000s. The problem is that the statisticians had not fully taken on board the extent to which mortgages in the 2000s were different to mortgages in the 1990s, particularly at the sub-prime end of the market.

Many of the 2000s mortgages required much less documentation than in the 1990s. People were often not even required to prove their level of income. They could just state their income. Nor was it necessary to pay for an independent valuation of the house; borrowers could just state the value of the house. Stated income loans were convenient for those without regular work, but anyone with common sense can see the potential temptation to overstating income to speculate on rising prices (they quickly became known as 'liar loans' on the street - a clue that the mathematicians could have picked up on if they had taken time to glance up from the algebra).

Another change was the help given with the deposit on the house. Whereas traditionally households would have to find 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the house value as a down-payment, in the new era brokers could offer a second mortgage (called a 'piggyback') which could be used as the deposit, so 100 per cent of the value of the house could be borrowed. Taking things a stage further, the UK's Northern Rock offered mortgages that were 125 per cent of the value of the house.

A further change was the increasing use of mortgages that had very low interest rates for the first two years ('teaser rates'), but after that they carried rates significantly higher than normal - 600 basis points above LIBOR was merely the average, many paid much more, i.e. well into double figures.

More rational players in this market allowed for the qualitative changes that had taken place in the housing markets in the noughties, rather than simplistically using a mathematical model developed in the 1990s for estimating default likelihood. Those wedded to quantified data in the statistical series had difficulties adjusting to the new reality.

# Originate-and-hold to originate-and-distribute

Traditionally, if a bank grants a mortgage it keeps it on its books until it is repaid. This is called the originate-and-hold model. In this way banks have every incentive to ensure that the mortgagee can repay and can help those few who have temporary problems along the way. Fewer and fewer banks kept mortgages on the books in the 2000s. They preferred the originate-and-distribute model, selling them to other investors, usually through securitisations. Alongside this development was the movement of investment banks to use their own money to invest in securities rather than only provide (lower-risk) advice and other fee-based activities.

In the 1990s only around one-quarter of sub-prime mortgages were packaged up into securitisation vehicles and sold to bond investors; by the mid-2000s three-quarters were. In the good old days Freddie and Fannie dominated this market; in the boom of the mid-2000s the private firms overtook the GSEs and issued vast quantities of mortgage-based securities – more than $1,000 billion per year, cumulating to $11,000 billion by 2007. The leaders of this pack included the Wall Street investment banks as well as Countrywide and Washington Mutual.

Pressure was applied to the mortgage brokers to generate more mortgages which could then be repackaged so that the investment banks could generate fees and other profits from the transaction. The mortgage brokers were only too happy to oblige, so they ran after people to sign up for mortgages to receive commission. No job, no deposit, on welfare benefits? Don't worry, we have just the mortgage for you!

Despite losing their lead, the GSEs still participated. Apart from holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of MBSs they had created, they also bought more than 1,000 billion of MBSs issued by the private firms. They felt safe because they had put in place 'safeguards'. First, if the loans were at more than 80 per cent of LTV they insisted on insurance being purchased from private insurance firms that pay out in the event of default. Second, the credit rating agencies had checked out the default likelihood on the private MBSs they bought and had concluded that they should be granted AAA status. What could go wrong?

# Collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)

The financial markets were not only awash with freshly minted plain-vanilla securitised bonds, with mortgage income being paid into a trust (company or partnership), which then serviced the bond coupons. Something as simple as that was so 1990s. No, in the bright new era the innovators had to go one stage further, and then two and then three.

In straightforward securitisations (see Chapter 6) the bonds issued by the special purpose vehicle are all the same. Each bond holder has an equal share in the returns generated on the underlying loans and will suffer an equal loss in the event of a proportion of the borrowers defaulting. But, thought the innovators, there are bond investors who are willing to take the high risk of say the first 5 per cent of borrowers defaulting. They will do this for a high interest rate, say 25 per cent per year. They will then hope that only say 4 per cent actually default over the next ten years. Now that the first hit from defaulters has been accepted by the high-risk takers the other bonds that could be sold on that pool of loan obligations have a much lower chance of suffering a loss. If the underlying loans are mortgages then investors can see from the statistical data that it is rare that more than 4 per cent of mortgagees fail to repay. Thus, if the first 5 per cent of defaults is to be absorbed by the holders of the high-risk bonds – often called the 'equity tranche' even though they are bonds – then there is hardly any chance of the low-risk bond holder suffering any loss through defaults.

A collateralised debt obligation is a bond issued by an SPV, set up by a deal structurer, usually an investment bank, where the SPV holds a pool of loans or a pool of debt securities.[18] The bonds are issued in a number of different classes or tranches, each with their own risk and return characteristics.

Note that while the underlying securities might be mortgages, credit card debts, car loans debts, etc. from the first stage of securitisation, they can also be a collection of securitised bonds. Thus, many (most in 2005-2007) CDOs were actually securitisations of securitised bonds.

We will start with an example where the CDO holds a collection of mortgages, rather than ABSs. Imagine that Hubris and Grabbit, that well-known investment bank, has granted 1 billion of mortgages to families throughout America. These are all sub-prime and so have a relatively high chance of default, therefore it would be difficult to persuade bond investors, most of whom can only invest in AAA rated bonds, to purchase securitised bonds in a plain vanilla asset-backed securitisation. If the overall rate of interest charged to mortgagees is 9 per cent then Hubris and Grabbit could create a CDO vehicle as shown in Exhibit 16.5. It sells the rights to the mortgage income and principal to the SPV, which issues CDO bonds.

# Exhibit 16.5 An example of a collateralised debt obligation

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/2fde9b36-2cff-4924-bde9-385c6eb1f001/bf989937667e8669fde8fb141824b151f9918bf3268559155308585eb29c42c8.jpg)

If it is accepted by potential CDO bond holders that there is a 4 per cent default rate then an equity tranche of CDOs could be created raising $100 million for the SPV by selling bonds in it. If the estimates of default prove overtime to be spot on, then of the original $1 billion, $40 million will be lost. The only tranche holders that will suffer will be the equity tranche, and they will still have $60 million left, plus the interest that has accumulated. To take this risk let us assume that these investors require 25 per cent per year interest. They might be lucky and only 2 per cent default in which case they accumulate a large sum. On the other hand if say 13 per cent of the mortgagees default it will wipe out their investments, as well as impact on the returns for the next tranche. This is the junior tranche. They have invested 150 million on a deal that gives them a fairly high rate of return at 12 per cent. But some of this will be forfeited if the default rate goes above 10 per cent. Because of the risk of experiencing a default these securitised bonds might be given a credit rating of around BBB- ('investment grade' but only just) and so could be bought by a range of financial institutions.

Tranche 3 is the mezzanine tranche, paying 8 per cent and will only suffer losses if the defaults amount to more than  $250 million (the amounts absorbed by the equity and junior tranche holders). It might gain a single A credit rating. If Tranche 3 raised$ 200 million then the final tranche, 'senior tranche', will comprise $600 million paying, say, 5.2 per cent per annum and will be granted an AAA rating. Thus Hubris and Grabbit have put in $1 billion of mortgage assets but sold CDOs (via the SPV) worth 1,050 million.

If you think this is complicated enough, the innovators had hardly warmed up. Some CDOs were structured to have 17 or more different tranches. A CDO squared  $(\mathrm{CDO}^2)$  was made up of a package of other CDOs (which, in turn, might be made up of a variety of asset-backed bonds). Then there were synthetic CDOs of ABS: these take on credit risk using credit default swaps rather than holding ABSs or CDOs.

Banks were greatly encouraged to create CDOs by the capital reserve rules. If they held  $1 billion of mortgages on their books they were required to hold, say,$ 40 million (4 per cent) of regulatory capital. If the bank sold 95 per cent of the loans in the form of CDOs, retaining 5 per cent in the form of the equity tranche, then it was required to hold much less equity capital.

# Rating agencies

The credit rating agencies generally do not rate the equity tranche because of the high risk of loss. However, they play a pivotal role when it comes to the perception held by investors of the other tranches. We have already covered how these overseers of default risk became entranced by algebraic constructs such as David Li's (Gaussian copula) model with its emphasis on correlation between assets in a pool. On top of the default rates and correlations of defaults we need to add the difficulties for the rating agencies of (a) figuring out likely recovery rates should a mortgage or a mortgage-backed securitised bond default – will the organisers of the CDO be able to recover 70 per cent of what was lent to a mortgagee? Or will it be 40 per cent? This is difficult to judge (or is the correct word 'guess'? and (b) the possibility of renegotiating or rescheduling the interest payments for a borrower that is running into difficulty. Being flexible with borrowers on conventional loans when they go through difficult times is relatively straightforward for the originate-and-hold lenders, but once the original mortgage has been through a couple of rounds of securitisation the connection with the mortgagee is greatly weakened and so specially tailored rescue reschedulings of payments become more difficult – which in itself increases the odds of total default. Thus, trying to measure the possible outcomes and likely future default rate/cash flow from owning a CDO is incredibly difficult.

Despite the difficulties and therefore the obvious need to err on the side of conservatism, the credit rating agencies were fully aware that they were in competition with each other. The customers for their services are the people trying to sell a bond or CDO. These customers need a rating from only one of the raters, thus they shopped around. To start with, Moody's developed a reputation for being fairly tough in granting investment grade status. The result was that Standard & Poor's picked up more fees from CDO issuers. Moody's later modified its cautious stance. Its mathematical models were altered and more asset-backed securities, ABSs and CDOs could be accepted as investment grade. This resulted in a booming fee income. You may think that they were persuaded to stray from the path of rigour, but I could not possibly comment.

But consider this: when it comes to rating corporate bonds there are thousands of potential customers, from BP to Unilever. It is fairly easy to be forceful in turning down a fee if one bond issuer out of a thousand is being too pushy in wanting an excessively favourable rating. The raters' long-term reputation can be preserved so that ratings on the thousands of other bonds rated are better trusted by bond holders. When it came to CDOs and other new-fangled securities such as SIVs (see below) the rating agencies were faced with a small group of banks that dominated the market. With the banks threatening to take their large fees to another rating agency you may think it far more difficult to resist the pressure to look at an issue favourably. They, quite naturally, did not want to offend the banks, especially given that towards the end of the boom half of their fee income could be from this 'structured finance' sector. The rating agencies worked very closely with the issuers of CDOs to advise on the cut-off points for the various tranches; they would help them structure them in such a way that the top AAA-rated element was as large as possible to maximise profit from selling the CDOs. To do this they did not investigate the underlying individual mortgages but relied on statistical databases: 'We aren't loan officers. Our expertise is as statisticians on an aggregate basis. We want to know, of 1,000 individuals, based on historical performance, what percentage will pay their loans?'[20] They used these statistical databases even when

40-50 per cent of the mortgages going into a CDO SPV were stated income loans for people with chequered credit histories. To have such a high proportion of loans to high-risk mortgages was a relatively new phenomenon – so what reliable data on default could they use?

To demonstrate the academic rigour of their models the rating agencies showed investors exactly how they worked. They even published them on the internet. This had a side effect: it presented an opportunity for the bankers to tweak any new complex financial engineering scheme they were contemplating, so that they could exploit loopholes in the agencies' models, and achieve that all-important triple A rating (this game is called 'ratings arbitrage').

# Structured investment vehicles (SIVs)

Here is an idea: mortgage-backed securities, composed of long-term debt obligations, carry higher interest rates than can be obtained by borrowing short term through the money markets. So, thinks a bright banker, why not create billions and billions of dollars worth of MBS paying, say, 8 per cent per year and then put them into a special purpose vehicle that is financed by commercial paper, paying, say, 7 per cent per year. The extra 1 per cent can come to us, the bankers, less a few expenses, of course. The more MBSs we create, the more we can make on the difference between the short-term interest rate and the long-term interest rate. So what we need to do is put lots of pressure/incentive on mortgage brokers to generate more mortgages so that our bonus next year can be even greater than last year.[21]

In ancient financial history, that is the 1980s, when bankers were more cautious, these types of vehicles were known as conduits. In order for them to obtain the very high credit ratings needed to sell commercial paper they had to offer investors belt-and-braces security. The sponsoring organisation, usually an investment bank, would provide an equity buffer by placing money in the conduit, and would also guarantee a line of credit. In other words, if the pool of mortgages ran into trouble and/or the commercial paper buyers refused to purchase paper for the next three-month period or whatever, the bank would step in to provide money to repay the maturing asset-backed commercial paper, so that the legally separate SPV did not have sell its assets in a 'fire sale' to repay the short-term money market investors.

Over time, with statistical models saying that the 2000s were a much calmer and safer environment in which to lend on the security of mortgages and ABSs, the idea of the conduit grew into the structured investment vehicle (SIV). These, too, needed high ratings to sell commercial paper, but this time the sponsoring bank's guarantee of a line of credit was smaller and outside investors (other than the bank) were brought in to take an equity stake in the SIV. The advantage of these changes was that the investment bank could keep SIVs off their balance sheets. So they had a nice profit earner without the need to hold much regulatory capital. This could lead to great improvements in bank return on equity. Under the Basel rules for capital requirements, because the SIVs raised a proportion of their money other than from the sponsoring bank and because the credit lines offered were less than a year in duration, the bank did not have to hold capital reserves for the exposure. The amount of equity capital held within an SIV was typically only 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the assets. Thus they were 10 or 20 times geared.

Of course, you can see the flawed thinking: however many mathematical models you build to calculate past default rates on mortgages, etc., and however many databases you look at to estimate the likelihood of the commercial paper market drying up, you cannot exclude the possibility that the people making decisions will suddenly change behaviour en masse. In particular, you need to remember that money market investors are looking for very safe investments. If there is even a hint of trouble in the SIVs they will all pull their money at the same time: not just from that SIV but from the entire sector. If dozens of SIVs are then forced to sell their assets to repay commercial paper as it falls due, these assets (ABSs, CDOs, corporate bonds, Treasury bills, etc.) fall in value, undermining the asset base of banks and other institutions further. SIVs are required to regularly announce the value of their assets – that is to mark-to-market – and so they could not hide and delay reporting losses; they were there for all to see.

One of the remarkable features of this period was the lack of understanding by regulators, governments, credit agencies and the financial press22 of what the banks were doing. CDOs and SIVs were explained to them and to us only after the crash. They had grown very big in a very short period of time.

# The internationalisation of risk

The activities discussed above were not confined to the US. London became the world's leading packager of SIVs, for example. Spanish mortgages were popular for CDO creation, and German banks bought vast quantities of AAA-rated US CDOs that offered a rate of return higher than on normal AAA-rated bonds. (Perhaps the high return should have raised some questions in their minds.) Despite the doubt expressed by staff members, the Royal Bank of Scotland grew its CDO business very fast, holding large quantities. UBS of Switzerland had 50 billion of CDOs on its trading desk in 2007. 'We were just told by our risk people that these instruments are triple A, like Treasury bonds. People did not ask too many questions,' said Peter Kurer, a member of the board.[23] Ah, that all-too-human failing: trusting people who have complex models to show you, that you don't understand.

Charles Pardue, one of the team who helped create acceptance for CDOs and SIVs through the intellectual work at J.P. Morgan (which was taken to ridiculous extremes by others), made the comment:

I don't think that we should kid ourselves that everything that is being sold is fair value. I have been to dealer events where bankers are selling this stuff and the simplicity of the explanation about how it works scares me …. there are people investing in stuff they don't understand, who really seem to believe the models, and when the models change it will be a very scary thing.[24]

# Credit default swaps (CDSs)

CDSs (described in Chapter 11) were important contributors to the crisis because they could be used to speculate on defaults without the need to hold the underlying corporate bond, ABS, CDO or SIV. Thus, a seller of a CDS could sell credit protection on, say,  $10 million of bonds and receive a premium of say$ 150,000. If a default does not occur, the seller makes a $150,000 profit. CDSs are bought and sold in a secondary market, with their prices rising if the default risk rises. It was not unusual to find that the amount of CDSs outstanding for a given bond, CDO, etc. was a multiple of the underlying collateral value. Thus, there might be $500 million bonds in issue and $5 billion of CDS contract outstanding on those bonds. If the bond defaulted then the maximum loss was $500m, but if the CDS sellers had to pay out they needed to find $5 billion. So you can see how liability exposure was multiplied by the use of these derivatives, especially when you consider that by mid-2007 the total notional amount of CDSs outstanding was more than $45,000 billion (the US mortgage market was 'only' 7,100 billion).

A key contributor to the crisis is that the payout on default under a CDS is merely a promise. So it is only as good as the financial strength of the seller. There was no central counterparty to back up that promise as there is with exchange-traded derivatives. Once the financial strengths of numerous CDS sellers was demolished, the insurance that purchasers of CDSs thought they had evaporated.

# Monoline insurers

The story of the crisis would not be complete without discussing the monoline insurers. Many investors in ABSs, MBSs, CDOs and SIVs were naturally concerned that these securities might be riskier than the promoter or the credit rating indicated. So, to provide extra reassurance the sellers of these instruments sought to take out insurance, similar to car insurance, with a premium up front and a payout if an event happened, such as non-payment of interest or principal. The monoline insurance firms started out as very low-risk organisations which offered insurance on bonds issued by US municipal authorities (states, towns, etc.). The buyers of the bonds would accept a lower yield (pay a higher price) if they came with an insurance guarantee.[25] The sellers were willing to pay the insurance premium because they could then sell the bonds at a raised price (because they were now rated AAA) to more than compensate for the insurance premium.

Insurance is only as good as the soundness of the company providing the guarantee. So in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s monoline insurers had very conservative balance sheets, allowing them to raise money by selling triple-A rated bonds in themselves. Insuring US municipalities (that raise taxes) results in a completely different order of risk than insuring the new securities backed by mortgages. However, in the 2000s the monolines thought they could stretch their expertise to this arena. The mathematicians at the monolines followed the same models used by the banks, rating agencies and regulators and so concluded that these complex instruments were low risk and therefore only a small insurance premium was required. They also became greedy, with some of them insuring 150 times the amount of their equity buffer. The slightest wobble in the sub-prime housing market and they would be insolvent as they paid out on defaults. They would not be able to raise more money in the event of a rise in mortgage delinquencies because the rating agencies would quickly reduce their ratings from AAA.

Many buyers of the fancy new instruments came to rely on the reassurance provided by the monolines. When they failed to meet their obligations this led to great losses for some organisations, and when those organisations could not meet their obligations it led to losses for their creditors.

# The crash

From 2002 the foreclosure rate (that is, the proportion of US mortgage holders for whom the bank has got fed up with missed payments and repossessed the house) actually fell to 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2005. Over the same period the proportion of loans that was delinquent (mortgages had not stuck to the agreement, but not so badly as to qualify for repossession) fell to 4.31 per cent. This seemed odd because there had been a large rise in the proportion of mortgages classified as sub-prime (e.g. 800 billion were sub-prime in 2005, almost half the total). Rising house prices had helped, because those with short-term money worries could remortgage (take out an extra loan on the security of the house) or sell the house for a profit; Americans did this in great volumes as the richest people in the world borrowed to sustain consumption at higher levels than income (there was a negative savings rate). Low interest rates and low unemployment also helped. However, this was the calm before the storm.

# Some early rumblings

In the spring of 2005 the credit rating on the debt of General Motors was downgraded to junk status. This was not unusual. Many issues of corporate debt are downgraded every month. The difference this time was that investors in credit default swaps and CDOs started to panic, causing their market prices to move wildly – so wildly that they were moving more than was assumed in the models. The market was showing signs of (a) nervousness and (b) failing to behave according to the models.

US foreclosures and delinquencies rose in 2006 and 2007. In the first quarter of 2007 foreclosures rose to a record level of over 2 per cent of outstanding mortgages. In February 2007, HSBC announced that its US subsidiary focused on sub-prime lending, Household Finance, had experienced sharply rising default levels. New Century Financial (second largest sub-prime lender) made a similar announcement. Now the cost of buying default protection against BBB-rated bonds of CDOs through credit default swaps rose significantly, but at least the market was still operating and CDS protection could be bought. Many bankers retained their optimism and wanted to stay in the leveraged loan game. They could not afford to reduce the next-quarter earnings by withdrawing from a large part of their business, even if they had qualms about the long-term safety of the transactions. Chuck Prince, CEO of Citigroup, famously told the  $FT$  in the summer that the party would end at some point but there was so much liquidity that it would not be disrupted by turmoil in the US sub-prime market, 'When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will get complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing … At some point, the disruptive event will be so significant that instead of liquidity filling in, the liquidity will go the other way. I don't think we're at that point.'[26]

By the third quarter of 2007 foreclosures on sub-prime loans had reached almost 7 per cent. Analysts were starting to believe studies that estimated that about 20 per cent of sub-prime mortgages would end in foreclosure. Whereas in the old days the lenders could have negotiated extra time to sell the house to raise more for both the bank and the family, or to let the borrower stay in the house making reduced payments, now, with securitisation, there was little opportunity for negotiation and rescheduling.

Bear Stearns had established two hedge funds and retained close financial links with them. The hedge funds had borrowed heavily to buy CDOs and other high-credit rated issues (on less than  $1 billion of capital they had$ 15 billion of CDOs). While the cost of borrowing remained less than the income from the CDOs they reported high profits (and paid large bonuses). In the summer of 2007 these sub-prime-focused funds reported difficulties – in one month alone the mark-to-market value of the CDOs, etc. fell by 19 per cent. Bear tried to sell some assets to repay the creditors now demanding their money back; If they were not repaid they were entitled to take possession of their collateral. Merrill Lynch, which was owed roughly $850m, and J.P. Morgan, which was owed $500m, took possession of their collateral. Disaster was averted by Bear Stearns taking on the responsibility of compensating many of the hedge funds' creditors. And so, although the market was shaken, it was not yet too frightened.

Deutsche Industriebank, IKB, a medium-sized German lender, had sought to make large profits by entering the SIV market. It sold its commercial paper to European pension funds and investment funds of US public-sector bodies, which trusted the triple-A or double-A ratings, to invest in mortgage-linked CDOs. When in July 2007 Moody's and Standard & Poor's reduced the ratings on some sub-prime mortgage bonds, and after the collapse of Bear Stearns' funds, the investors in IKB's SIV knew they had made a mistake. They bargained for very low risk, and now the reassurance of high credit ratings was being removed. They lacked the skills or the data to value the securities that the SIV had invested in – they relied on credit ratings only. So, in their fear, they stopped buying fresh commercial paper. The offshoot SIVs of IKB had $20 billion of assets compared with the bank's liquid assets of $16 billion. The parent could not find the money to put into the SIVs to prevent the commercial paper holders insisting on a fire sale of assets to repay them within days. Such a fire sale was impossible anyway, given the lack of liquidity in the CDO markets. In the end, the German government forced a group of banks to lend enough to IKB for it to survive. Disaster averted.

Meanwhile, over in Paris, BNP Paribas stopped investors in three of its funds from being able to redeem their investments. It said that it was impossible to value the funds because of high exposure to the US sub-prime market. This disturbed investors.

Aware of a growing sense of foreboding among investors, some of the large banks, such as HSBC and Citibank, brought the assets and liabilities of their SIVs onto their balance sheets so that nervous outside investors could be paid off. Many banks started to realise that their assets were shrinking while they faced a marketplace where it was difficult to raise short-term money – confidence was slipping fast. Some managed to obtain infusions of capital from sovereign wealth funds through the selling of a number of new shares; others could not persuade anybody to buy their shares to bolster their defences.

The MBS and CDO markets worsened to the point where it became difficult to sell even plain vanilla AAA MBSs. People realised that they just did not know what the fancy securities were worth in a falling housing market.

In August 2007, American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation filed for bankruptcy due to losses on mortgage-related assets and the inability to sell commercial paper. Countrywide, which had operated an almost conveyor belt machine approach to generating mortgages to sell on in a securitised form, said it was starting to stockpile mortgages because of a scarcity of investors. Tension was starting to spread and bankers were told to stop lending to any other financial institution that looked at all risky. They were starting to hoard cash. This was a rational response from the individual banks' perspective but the result was that the interbank loan market, commercial paper and other markets experienced rising interest rates and difficulties in funding. By this stage much of the world economy was dependent on the assumption of reasonably priced money always available. When it became apparent that this was a false assumption, fear increased. It grew further when the default rates on sub-prime mortgages were announced in the autumn, now at 16 per cent. This perplexed some because the economy was still growing and unemployment was low. The answer lay in very bad financial decisions: people had become overstretched after being seduced by the offer of a loan to buy a house that they could never have repaid given their low income. The chickens were coming home to roost.

# A UK trigger

Northern Rock had built itself up from a small former building society into the fifth largest UK lender by taking advantage of the securitisation craze. By 2007 most of the funding for its mortgages came from a process of originate-and-distribute. It had nothing to do with US sub-prime, but had built up its own sub-prime operation and more damagingly it had come to rely on a quick selling-on of its loans to the wholesale financial markets to generate a flow of cash to cover mortgages it had already granted. When the psychology of fear swept over the markets, taking the place of enthusiasm for mortgage-related structured securities, suddenly the message went out around the world to stop investing in anything mortgage related. Northern Rock found itself with thousands of mortgages that it had to refinance within days or it would run out of cash. It could not find that cash in the frozen wholesale market and the possibility of attracting deposits from individual savers was a non-starter given the amount the bank now needed to fund. So it turned to the Bank of England to ask for emergency support.

Once word got out that Northern Rock was short of cash, millions of savers panicked. They quickly withdrew money from their online accounts and they queued around the block outside its branches. For the first time since the nineteenth century the UK had a bank run. The government was forced into reassuring depositors by guaranteeing all deposits with the bank. The Bank of England provided funds to keep it operating. Northern Rock was so badly wounded that no private buyer would take it on. So in early 2008 it was nationalised.

The UK regulatory system was particularly badly prepared for overseeing the financial innovations of the Noughties. Regulation was split between the Financial Service Authority, the Bank of England and the Treasury. The FSA was given responsibility for judging bank strategies. From its limited perspective, what it saw was that banks were complying with its rules and so it did not intervene. It did not have a system-wide focus and did not appreciate the threat from CDOs and SIVs. That was left up to the Bank of England, which did make noises about the worryingly fast growth of the banks' balance sheets, but without the backing of the FSA and the Treasury, it lacked the power to intervene.

Following the Northern Rock fiasco, in April 2008, the Bank of England introduced the Special Liquidity Scheme which enabled banks to swap their mortgage-backed securities and other assets for Treasury bills. These could then be sold in the market to raise cash.

# A major US trigger – Bear Stearns

By the winter of 2007/2008 analysts, particularly those at the rating agencies, were having considerable doubts about their model assumptions. For example, the recovery rate for foreclosed mortgages was assumed to be 70 per cent. But that was calculated before the massive rise of sub-prime and the growth of the worst forms of sub-prime. These were termed NINJAs – No Income, No Job or Assets. They were granted on the assumption that house price rises would pay off the mortgage when the family moved. When they knew they were to be repossessed these households would leave their property in a much worse state than those in the 1990s. And, of course, house prices were falling. So now the analysts estimated that only 40 per cent of the loan amount would be recovered on a foreclosure. What made things even worse was that in some areas, as house prices fell and repossessions rose, the neighbourhood became blighted – nobody wanted to live there. This, together with growing negative equity (house worth less than mortgage), created a reflexive feedback loop, a self-fulfilling view on the future of house prices in that area. This psychological problem was not allowed for in the mathematical models on default levels. By now even the mathematicians were becoming frightened.

Citigroup had been one of the most enthusiastic creators of CDOs, particularly in 2006 and 2007. Many of these would be held on its balance sheet until buyers could be found. By the end of 2007 the amounts reached the staggering level of  $55 billion. On top of that it had made promises to repay within days$ 25 billion of commercial paper secured by CDOs. It had to announce potential write-offs of up to $11 billion. It was not alone: Merrill Lynch wrote off $20.2 billion and UBS 15 billion. Bank shares fell dramatically.

Prior to the crisis the bankers had managed to persuade the regulators that the complex instruments they were creating would disperse risk to those most able to bear it – hinting that it would be borne by non-bank institutions and funds. In reality, the CDOs etc. seemed to be piling up on bank's balance sheets as they swapped assets between themselves and held inventories of them until they could be sold. They had concentrated risk rather than dispersed it.

For the next few months the write-offs announced by Citi, Merrill and UBS grew larger as banks found themselves at the centre of a downward spiral. The more losses that were revealed, the less confidence investors had. The less confidence, the more assets had to be sold (or marked to market) in a declining market, leading to lower confidence and thus reduced values.

Bear Stearns had become increasingly dependent on the repo market (see Chapter 5) to raise short-term funds. Using repos means that a substantial proportion of funding has to be rolled over on a daily basis. It used mortgage-backed bonds as collateral. Once confidence in these instruments declined, Bear found difficulties in obtaining short-term loans. In March 2008, the regulators realised that Bear was in trouble and that if it defaulted on its current repos it would cause panic in the wholesale markets. To prevent that they negotiated for other financial institutions to buy it. Eventually J.P. Morgan agreed to do so, but at a price that left little value for the previous shareholders in Bear. The directors had destroyed shareholder value on a massive scale.

The rescue of Bear, with the regulators to the fore, and the subsequent slashing of US prime interest rates, reassured the markets for a few months as they reasoned that the government and the Fed would not allow a major bank failure and a crash. But this sanguine view had to contend with some disturbing facts: (1) The assets of the SIVs had grown to be worth several trillion dollars – these needed regular refunding in a depressed market; (2) The shadow banks (SIVs, hedge funds, money market funds, etc. – see Chapter 15), which are regulated much less than the banks, now had a complex web of trading obligations with the banks, including 60,000 billion of CDSs. The system was so interconnected and so opaque that no one could figure how it could unravel if more confidence was lost.

# The Lehman trigger

Many of the US sub-prime mortgages granted in 2005 and 2006 offered low teaser rates for the first two years, so by 2008 when households faced much higher monthly payments, the analysts were anticipating an accelerated default rate. This would reduce confidence in mortgage-related instruments further. Some analysts in spring 2008 estimated the loss in the prices of CDOs would turn out to total 400 billion. By September, with US houses 20 per cent down from their peak prices, things had got so bad in the securitised market that the loss in value weakened Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the point where they were taken into conservatorship (nationalisation) by the Fed. They had both operated with relatively small capital bases on which was piled a great deal of debt. A number of writers of credit default swaps on Freddie and Fannie securities suffered losses, hitting sentiment hard.

Lehman Brothers, like Bear Stearns, had drawn a high proportion of its funding from the repo market and had enormous exposure to residential mortgage bond instruments and commercial property. Once the other financial institutions suspected that Lehmans was losing money to the point where it might default, they simply stopped lending to it. It was on the point of collapse when the Fed assembled the heads of the major banks to cajole them into rescuing it. The government or the Fed could not rescue another irresponsible financial institution. They were already receiving criticism for rescuing Bear and the GSEs. If the regulators go on like this, it was said, they will create moral hazard in which financial institutions take outlandish risks knowing that the authorities will step in to prevent failure and the loss of those highly paid jobs and all those bonuses for 'risk taking'.

'No more soft touch' was the message. An example had to be made to ram home the idea that financial organisations would suffer the consequences of their actions. Ideally, Lehman's operations, asset and liabilities would be taken over by another bank(s), with its shareholders' value being wiped out and senior management removed. However, no other bank wanted to take on Lehman's positions and it was made bankrupt on 15 September. Not only did writers of CDSs on Lehman's debt have to take a hit but on that day it was counterparty to roughly 800 billion of CDSs. Because of the intertwined financial obligations institutions around the world had with Lehman's investors, the failure of Lehmans to meet its obligation had a whole series of knock-on effects. They panicked.

Some examples of the knock-on effects included:

- London-based hedge funds with money held by Lehman's had their assets frozen, so they could not complete deals they had made.
- Managers and investors in money market funds had believed that the authorities would save Lehman's and therefore their holdings of Lehman's debt was safe. Now the perception changed. They swallowed losses on Lehman and nervously looked around for who might be next. Fear and caution led to sharp reduction of short-term money availability, and spiralling interest rates. The Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund, 'broke the buck' (the net asset value dropped below the amount put in by investors) causing even greater aversion to supplying finance to the commercial paper market – the market size fell by 500 billion in one week.
- The largest writer of credit default swaps, AIG, the world's largest insurance company, was headed toward losses of over 180 billion. It had nowhere near this amount of money to make good on its promises. Ben Bernanke of the Fed said that he was very angry that AIG, a stable insurance company, had developed hedge fund-type derivative positions (CDOs) that completely overshadowed its normal business.
Stock markets fell, wiping away billions of paper wealth, helping to create a sense of doom.
- Institutions refused to deal with one another as rumours flew around about which would be the next to collapse. Trust had evaporated. Those financial economists, mathematicians and heads of banks were made painfully aware that markets need human trust and confidence more than they need complex mathematics.

Now the dominoes fell fast. In September 2008 AIG was granted an 85 billion loan from the Fed in exchange for a 79.9 per cent equity stake in the business (effectively nationalisation). It was too big and too interconnected to be allowed to fail. In the same month Merrill Lynch was so desperate that it agreed to be taken over by Bank of America. A few days later one of the largest UK banks the ailing HBOS was bought by Lloyds, and Washington Mutual (sixth largest US bank) collapsed and was sold to J.P. Morgan for a fraction of its previous value. Then the UK government was forced into nationalising Bradford and Bingley.

# Government actions

# Bank rescues

In the days after the loss of Lehmans the US Treasury and the Fed were shocked at the extent of the knock-on effects, and knew they had to do something. They proposed the creation of a fund of 700 billion to buy 'troubled assets' from the banks.[27] However, this was quickly changed to a plan to inject money directly into banks rather than merely purchase assets from them. The bank leaders were gathered together and told that they would have to accept the injection of government money for preferred share stakes or they would not be eligible for any future bailout. The government holding of shares in Citigroup was increased so that it was, in effect, nationalised. When Bank of America realised just how rotten the assets of Merrill Lynch were they needed a further government injection. The government also permitted Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to change from being technically classified as brokers into banks, allowing them to benefit from government bailouts including access to the Fed funds discount window (the US lender of last resort function – see Chapter 7). Goldman was forced to ask for an infusion of cash by selling 5 billion of preferred stock offering a very high dividend to Berkshire Hathaway (chairman – Warren Buffett).

The US Treasury insured the  $3,400 billion money market mutual fund industry (it would not allow shares in money market funds to fall below the$ 1 in value put in by savers) to encourage investors to retain their savings in the system. This was bailing out 30 million Americans and comprised one half of all deposits at domestic US banks. If this had not been done US savers would have become very wary. The cascade of fear might have caused a Depression.

Over in London the government and the Bank of England were dead set against bank bailouts because they did not want to encourage moral hazard. However, once they realised the full extent of leverage in the system and that the banks faced not just a liquidity problem (as with Northern Rock) but a solvency problem (see Chapter 7), they decided to act. Mervyn King at the BoE was shocked: 'When we started this crisis there was a widespread view that banks were well capitalised. But now we realise that the problem was that assets sitting on their balance sheets which were supposed to be risk-free, carried a lot of risk. Perceptions of the value of those assets and the risks changed radically.'[28] The BoE set about injecting £200 billion of cash into the money markets. The government guaranteed £250 billion of bonds issued by banks as well buying equity stakes in some leading banks. Royal Bank of Scotland received £20 billion in new equity and Lloyds which had avoided the lure of structured finance and was strong before it bought the less disciplined HBOS received £17 billion.

Dexia was rescued by the governments of Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, while the Irish government stopped a run on their banks by guaranteeing all deposits (a move that was to later virtually bankrupt the government). Hypo Real Estate was saved by the German government and Fortis was nationalised by the Dutch. Iceland nationalised its banks which had liabilities many times the size of the economy of its 320,000 people, and was forced to seek financial help from the International Monetary Fund.

# Economy rescues

Recession started in the US economy at the end of 2007 and grew worse through 2008 to become the worst since the 1930s. Similar downturns were experienced in Europe, and the leading developing countries suffered a slowing down in growth. To combat lowered confidence in the economic future and rising unemployment, western governments pumped demand up in the economy by dramatically increasing deficit spending – i.e. spending far more than is raised in taxes by borrowing the difference. The rapidly rising levels of government debts will have severe long-term consequences as we ask later generations to pay off the bill for this borrowing. They also have dramatic political consequences, with many governments being rejected by the electorate for not preventing, or failing to effectively deal with, the crisis.

Western central banks reduced interest rates to close to zero to encourage economic activity (see Chapter 7 for a discussion on monetary policy). Governments and central banks also purchased bonds from the private sector (usually banks) to lower interest rates at the medium and longer end of the yield curve as well as supplying money to the system. This quantitative easing is discussed in Chapter 7 as are a number of other regulatory responses such as living wills and tighter bank capital ratios (see also Chapter 15).

# Concluding comments

Following each crisis there is always a feeling that, as we rush around tightening that regulation, banning that type of security, or changing that incentive, we are merely preparing for the last war. Even now, so soon after the last bust, clever bankers with mastery of complex maths will be working on innovative securities that will be designed to get around this or that regulation (regulatory arbitrage); fool this or that credit rating agency; bemuse and impress impressionable trustees of other people's money from pension funds to insurance funds and hedge funds. Hopefully there is a greater proportion of mathematical model sceptics who, while accepting that the models have their uses, realise that they need to be moderated, supplemented and even overridden by human decision makers, who take into account a wide range of factors beyond those immediately quantifiable.

# Golden rules:

1 If you cannot understand it, don't invest in it. Have an acute awareness of the perimeter of your circle of competence: do you know what you know and know what you don't know? Don't trust others peddling complexity because you fear looking foolish when everyone else is saying what wonderful clothes the Emperor has. Complexity, particularly mathematical complexity, is not the same as sophistication. Modification for regulators: if you don't understand it, why are you allowing it?

2 If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. How did anyone believe that a CDO of ABSs could hold a credit rating of AAA, the same as for a highly reputable corporation, and yet offer hundreds of basis points more in interest?

3 Be wary of the power of some innovations to grow a new market quickly and then destroy. 'Successful innovation by its very nature initially outstrips our ability to regulate it' said Robert Merton.[29] Paul Volcker, a former chairman of the Fed, has doubts about the value of increasing the complexity of financial instruments. As he reflected on the financial scene he put the complexity-merchants in their place by saying that over the past 30 years the most useful innovation was the automatic teller machine: 'I wish somebody would give me some shred of neutral evidence about the relationship between financial innovation recently and the growth of the economy.'[30]

4 Beware of collective delusion. The pressure from the crowd to believe in a bad idea is powerful. Think independently. Even those supposedly great authorities, the regulators and the credit rating agencies, were proved to have hopelessly inadequate methods and a weakness for believing the prevailing wisdom, so you need to think for yourself.

5 High leverage is dangerous. Warren Buffett says: 'It's kind of like alcohol. One drink is fine, but ten will get you in a lot of trouble. With leverage, people have a great propensity to use it because it's so much fun when it works. There should be some ways of controlling leverage.'[31] Bankers focus on return on equity in the short run. So, for a given return on assets, the greater the proportion of those assets financed by leverage, the higher the return on equity. They can become addicted to raising earnings per share each quarter or half year by increasing leverage. They can do this for many years before the risk becomes apparent. They need help in controlling their addiction, which is where the regulators come in.

6 Avoid situations of interdependence that result in confused entanglement, where no one knows who is really holding the risk.

7 Do not have incentive systems where it's heads I win, tails the other guy loses. Many of the bankers working in ABSs, CDOs, CDSs and SIVs took home large bonuses in the good times (over 1 million each year) regardless of the impact on those they were dealing with. Even when things turned sour many retained highly paid positions.

8 When financial bubbles blow up remember Cinderella, who knew it could not last but could not see clocks on the wall to tell her when it would all turn to pumpkins and mice, and besides which she was having so much fun. Everyone thinks they will be able to get out five minutes before midnight.[32]

9 Recognise that banks are not very good at self-regulation. As well as the authorities insisting on robust capital and liquidity reserves, they must implement some form of separation of the 'casino' activities of investment banking trading and derivatives activities from the retail banking operations. This must be structured so that the former can be allowed to go bust taking shareholder and wholesale market creditor wealth with them, but the retail bank activities can carry on following a government bailout, preserving the value to society of the deposit taking, business lending and money transmission functions. They should also insist on detailed and regularly updated plans for the orderly recovery or liquidation of a bank if it should at some point in the future run into trouble.

10 Remember that banks are full of smart people who will exploit a gap or loophole created because national authorities do not create regulatory structures that work across borders.

There will be another crisis; in fact, there will be many. I don't know when or where or what form they will take, but I do know that structures created by humans are subject to emotional surges, cognitive failure, hubris born of neat modelling and the tendency to forget most of the golden rules and the lessons of history. The best that we can hope for is that it is not too soon.

# Key points and concepts

Finance is a multidisciplinary subject, and not primarily mathematical.

The algebra lovers, with their complex, yet unsophisticated, modelling of the world of human constructs, such as markets, can lead us astray.

- Value at risk, or VaR, is an estimate of the loss on a portfolio over a period of time (usually 24 hours is chosen) that will be exceeded with a given frequency, e.g. a frequency of one day out of 100, or five days out of 100.
- Mathematicians were not allowing for the possibility of extreme events (called black swans) – that the tails of the distribution are in fact much bigger, 'fatter', than generally supposed, because extreme things hit us more often than we anticipate.
VaR led many senior bankers into a false sense of security prior to the crisis. They were thus emboldened to double and triple their bets on securities such as mortgage CDOs because they appeared to produce high profits without raising VaR much. Under the Basel capital rules for banks VaR could be used as an argument for lowering capital requirements.
- Reflexivity: decisions are based on people's perception or interpretation of the situation. Furthermore, their decisions can change the situation, alter the fundamentals. Changes in the fundamentals thus caused are liable to change the perceptions of individuals.
- Occasionally the reflexive interaction can lead to massive market distortions – 'far-from-equilibrium conditions' – leading to boom/bust sequences.
The super-bubble reflexive process evolved over a period of a quarter of a century. The main prevailing trend was ever-more sophisticated methods of credit expansion, supported by the trend to globalisation and the trend of the removal of regulations with increasing financial innovation.

Some of the main elements:

- Low interest rates in early 2000s.
Growth of asset-backed securitisation.
- Growth of sub-prime mortgages in 2000s, with increasingly lax criteria.
- Incentives for mortgage brokers to sell high volumes.
Credit score models used data from a time when the mortgage market was significantly different.
- Movement from the originate-and-hold model, where banks retain the loan on their books and therefore have every incentive to ensure that the mortgagee can repay and can help those few who have temporary problems along the way, to the originate-and-distribute model, selling them to other investors, usually through securitisations.
- Massive growth in collateralised debt obligation market: a bond issued by a special purpose vehicle, SPV, set up by a deal structurer, usually an investment bank, where the SPV holds a pool of loans or a pool of debt securities. The bonds are issued in a number of different classes or tranches, each with their own risk and return characteristics.
Credit rating agencies seemed to follow the same limited mathematical models as others.
- Structured investment vehicles, SIVs buy assets such as mortgages or ABSs after raising finance mostly by selling commercial paper.
- The amount of CDSs outstanding for a given bond, CDO, etc. was often a multiple of the underlying collateral value. And the promise to pay was only as good as the financial strength of the CDS seller.
- The monoline insurance firms started out as very low risk organisations who offered insurance on bonds issued by US municipal authorities. In the 2000s the monolines thought they could stretch their expertise to the mortgage backed securities market. The mathematicians at the monolines followed the same models used by the banks, rating agencies and regulators, and so concluded that these complex instruments were low risk and therefore only a small insurance premium was required. They also became greedy with some of them insuring 150 times the amount of their equity buffer.

4 (a) FRA The treasurer agrees a 6 against 9 FRA whereby the counterparty will pay compensation to the company should interest rates fall below 8 per cent. These payments will exactly offset any loss of interest below 8 per cent. However, if interest rates rise above 8 per cent the company will pay compensation to the counterparty such that the company effectively receives 8 per cent return on deposited money. Certainty is achieved.

Interest rate future

Three-month sterling interest future contracts (September contracts) are bought at 92.00. Each contract is for a nominal £500,000; therefore 40 contracts are bought to hedge the full £20 million. If interest rates fall, the rise in the value of the future will offset the fall in interest on deposited money.

(a)

(b) Future variable interest rates may fall below 9 per cent (i.e. Libor @ 7.5 per cent). This will impose an opportunity cost of entering the swap arrangements.

- Black must accept the possibility of counterparty default.
- Transaction costs (e.g. legally binding contracts) may be considerable.
- Black needs to consider its overall asset and liability profile.

(c) The cap seller compensates Black:

$$
5 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 (0. 1 0 - 0. 0 8 5) \quad = \quad £ 7 5 0, 0 0 0

$$

The compensation from the cap seller means that Black will not pay more than £5 million (net) per annum

Battik has an absolute advantage in both but Attik has a comparative advantage in borrowing at fixed rate (100 bp difference compared with 130 bp difference)

A possible swap: Attik borrows fixed @ 8\%

Battik borrows floating @ LIBOR + 1.2\%

Attik agrees to pay Battik LIBOR + 2.35\%

Battik agrees to pay Attik fixed @ 8\%

Result for Attik: Pays and receives fixed @ 8\%. Pays LIBOR + 2.35\% an improvement of 15 basis points compared with borrowing in floating rate market.

Result for Battik: Pays LIBOR + 1.2\%, receives LIBOR + 2.35\%. Resulting a net payment of 115 bp. It pays 8\% fixed but also benefits from the swap by 115 bp therefore the net fixed cost is 6.85\%, a 15 bp improvement than if it had borrowed fixed @ 7\%.

13 Euro swap: Swap five-year floating for the fixed rate. Your firm will pay  $4.37 + 0.20 = 4.57\%$  to swap market counterparty. Then your firm will pay LIBOR + 230 bp to original lender and receive floating rate @ LIBOR, effectively setting the overall interest rate at 230 bp + 457 bp = 687 bp fixed for five years. €400 million × 0.0687 = €27.48 million per year.

Sterling swap: Swap a four -year obligation to pay LIBOR in return for receiving 4.56  $-0.20\% = 4.36\%$ . Pay 620 bp and receive 436 bp. Net payment  $= 184\mathrm{bp} +$  LIBOR

\begin{array}{l l} \text {E x e r c i s e o p t i o n t o e x c h a n g e @ R 7 . 5 / £ (1 5 0 / 7 . 5)} & = \quad £ 2 0. 0 0 0 m \\ \text {l e s s c o s t o f o p t i o n (p r e m i u m)} & \quad £ 0. 4 0 0 m \\ & \quad £ 1 9. 6 0 0 m \end{array}
$$

This is better than having to exchange @ R8.00/£ which would have produced merely £18.75 million.

Numerical aspects only. (Students should also describe and explain instruments and methods used. They should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each – for more details of these consult the chapter.)

Forward market hedge

At the current time agree a forward contract whereby Lozenge plc will purchase  $12 \times 50,000 = \mathrm{M}\$  600,000$ in three months. To do this it will need to provide  $600,000 / 5.425 = £110,599$  to the counterparty in three months.

Then, if the Malaysian dollar rises against sterling in the intervening period, Lozenge will not have to pay more than £110,599. Say the exchange rate moved to M4.00/£: an unhedged Lozenge would pay 600,000/4.00 = £150,000. Hedging has 'saved' the firm a sum of £150,000 - £110,599. On the other hand, the firm cannot take advantage of a favourable forex move.

If the Malaysian dollar had weakened to M7.00/£ and the firm was able to exchange at the spot rate, it would pay only 600,000/7 = £85,714. Thus £110,599 - £85,714 = £24,885 foregone by entering into the forward contract.

Option hedge

An option permits the firm to benefit from a favourable exchange rate while hedging against an unfavourable movement. However, a premium has to be paid, which reduces net income.

Lozenge could purchase the right, but not the obligation, to sell sterling and buy Malaysian dollars at a cost of  $600,000 / 5.425 = £110,599$  for a premium of  $15,000 / 5.4165 = £2,769$ .

If the Malaysian dollar strengthens to M $4.00/£, then Lozenge will exercise the right to purchase at M$ 5.425/£. This will 'save' £150,000 - £110,599 - £2,769 = £36,632 compared with a no hedge policy.

If the Malaysian dollar weakens against sterling to M7.00/£, then Lozenge will abandon the option and exchange at spot rate.

Cost of imports:  $(600,000 / 7) + 2,769 = £88,483.$

This is cheaper than if a forward contract approach or money market approach were adopted, but more expensive (due to the option premium) than if a no hedge approach were adopted.

Money market hedge

Exchange sterling now for Malaysian dollars, so that there will be M600,000 with accumulated interest in three months:

$$
\frac {6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 . 0 3} = \mathrm {M} \$ 5 8 2, 5 2 4
$$

Sterling required  $= \frac{582.524}{5.4165} = 107,546$

If the sterling is borrowed, then to be comparable with the alternative hedging approaches (which involve the handing over of sterling in three months), we need to increase by three months' interest:

$$
£ 1 0 7, 5 4 6 (1. 0 3) = £ 1 1 0, 7 7 3
$$

In three months:

Pay supplier with Malaysian dollars already purchased (including accumulated interest) M600,000.

(b)  $\frac{1.06}{1.09} \times 1.77 = \epsilon 1.7213 / \mathrm{US}$

11 (a) Forward purchase of sterling

$$
\frac {\mathrm {W o n} 1 , 5 0 7 \mathrm {m}}{1 , 4 5 0} = £ 1. 0 3 9 3 1 \mathrm {m}
$$

(b) Borrow in won and exchange for sterling immediately.

Amount borrowed:  $\frac{1,507}{1.005} = \mathrm{Won} 1,499.5 \mathrm{~m}$

Exchange:  $\frac{1,499.5\mathrm{m}}{1,507} = £995,023$

In one month the lender is paid with the won received from the customer.
