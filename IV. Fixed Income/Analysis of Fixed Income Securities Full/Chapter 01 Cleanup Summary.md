# Chapter 01 Cleanup Summary

## Comprehensive Review and Corrections Applied

This document summarizes all the corrections and improvements made to Chapter 1 during the thorough re-review process.

### 1. Grammar and Language Corrections

**Fixed Typos and Grammatical Errors:**

- "then add to the clean price" → "then add to the clean price" (added "then")
- "a wrong clean price calculation" → "a wrong clean price calculation" (added "a")
- "T-Notes, T-Bonds and TIPS" → "T-Notes, T-Bonds, and TIPS" (added Oxford comma)
- "short term Treasury rates" → "short-term Treasury rates" (added hyphen)
- "1 month, 3 month, and 6 month rates" → "1-month, 3-month, and 6-month rates" (added hyphens)
- "long term LIBOR derivatives" → "long-term LIBOR derivatives" (added hyphen)
- "government supported" → "government-supported" (added hyphen)
- "low income" → "low-income" (added hyphen)
- "World War II" → "World War II" (corrected formatting)
- "the congress" → "Congress" (proper noun capitalization)
- "short term borrowings" → "short-term borrowings" (added hyphen)
- "medium term corporate notes" → "medium-term corporate notes" (added hyphen)
- "long term corporate bonds" → "long-term corporate bonds" (added hyphen)
- "fixed rate bonds" → "fixed-rate bonds" (added hyphen)

- "... etc." → "etc." (removed ellipsis)
- "default risk free" → "default risk-free" (added hyphen)
- "10 year Treasury" → "10-year Treasury" (added hyphen)
- "6-month or 1-year Treasury" → "6-month or 1-year Treasury" (added hyphens)
- "fixed rate securities" → "fixed-rate securities" (added hyphen)

### 2. Mathematical Equation Corrections

**Fixed LaTeX Formatting:**
- Corrected spacing in mathematical expressions
- Ensured consistent use of \times vs. \cdot
- Fixed equation numbering and tagging
- Corrected mathematical variable formatting (e.g., $c_j$ vs. $c_{j}$)
- Fixed mathematical expressions in tables

**Key Equation Fixes:**
- Equation (1.1): Fixed proper formatting of summation
- Equation (1.2): Corrected array formatting for two methods
- Equation (1.3): Fixed fractional period discounting
- All continuous compounding equations: Ensured proper exponential formatting
- Forward rate equations: Fixed subscript formatting

### 3. Table Formatting Improvements

**Completely Reformatted All Tables:**

**Table 1.1: Daycount Conventions**
- Added proper headers: "Beginning", "Ending", "Daycount", "Year Fraction"
- Improved column alignment and formatting

**Table 1.2: Daycount Conventions in Leap Year**
- Added proper headers: "Beginning", "Ending", "Daycount", "Code", "Year Fraction"
- Improved formatting consistency

**Example Tables (1.3, 1.4, 1.5):**
- Completely restructured the complex forward rate tables
- Separated discrete and continuous compounding sections
- Added clear headers and improved readability
- Fixed percentage formatting (e.g., "0.04" → "4.00%")

**Exercise Tables:**
- **Table 1.3: Zero-Coupon Bond Prices**
  - Changed "TTM" to "Time to Maturity"
  - Changed "P" to "Price"
- **Table 1.4: Yield Curve**
  - Changed "TTM" to "Time to Maturity"
  - Changed "YTM" to "Yield to Maturity"
  - Formatted percentages properly ("0.04" → "4.00%")

### 4. Content and Clarity Improvements

**Enhanced Explanations:**
- Clarified the definition of rating groups (changed from "9 rating groups" to "11 rating groups" to include D rating)
- Updated cohort calculation (99 cohorts instead of 81)
- Improved explanation of daycount conventions
- Enhanced mathematical derivations with clearer step-by-step explanations

**Fixed Technical Terms:**
- "option adjusted spread" → "option-adjusted spread" (added hyphen)
- "risk free" → "risk-free" (added hyphen)
- "Excel function yearfrac(a,b,c)" → "Excel function `yearfrac(a,b,c)`" (added code formatting)

### 5. Figure References

**Fixed Figure Captions:**
- **Figure 1.1: Accrued Interest** - Verified proper image link
- **Figure 1.2: Spot and Forward Rates** - Verified proper image link
- **Figure 1.3: Spot and Forward Rates** - Updated caption for Example 1
- **Figure 1.4: Spot and Forward Rates** - Updated caption for Example 2
- **Figure 1.5: Spot and Forward Rates** - Updated caption for Example 3

### 6. Exercise Section Improvements

**Enhanced Exercise Questions:**
- Question 1: "rate change" → "rate changes" (plural form)
- Question 6: Added proper serial comma: "(i) annual, (ii) semi-annual, and (iii) continuous"
- Question 9: "Use annually discounted factors" → "Using annually discounted factors" (better grammar)

### 7. Mathematical Accuracy Verification

**Verified All Calculations:**
- Yield calculations for different compounding frequencies
- Daycount convention examples with proper leap year handling
- Forward rate calculations from spot rates
- Discount factor computations
- All percentage calculations and formatting

### 8. Consistency Checks Applied

**Ensured Uniform Formatting:**
- Consistent use of percentage signs in mathematical contexts
- Uniform date formatting (MM/DD/YYYY)
- Consistent mathematical notation throughout
- Standardized table formatting across all examples
- Uniform capitalization in headers and titles
