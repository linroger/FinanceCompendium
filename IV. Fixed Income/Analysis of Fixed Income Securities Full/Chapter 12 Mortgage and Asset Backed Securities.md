# Chapter 12: Mortgage and Asset Backed Securities

# 12.1 Introduction

MBS is the perhaps the most successful financial innovation in the world of banking and finance globally. The creation of MBS allows the US to be one of very few (could be only) countries that can offer "affordable housing" via free market and not via government subsidy. The creation of the MBS market allows individual investors like you and I can participate in helping borrowers to buy their own homes.

Not only does MBS market help borrowers to finance their home purchases, it also provides investors more choices for their investments. In an academic term, MBS help complete the financial market. See the CAMP diagram in Figure 12.1.

Figure 12.1: Where MBS Lies

There are two types of MBS: RMBS (residential) and CMBS (commercial).

The former contains mortgages made out to residential homes. It further is understood as agency-based and non-agency-based. The latter is based upon commercial mortgages which are loans made out to commercial real estate properties such as hotels, rental apartments, casinos, etc.

# 12.1.1 RMBS

# Agencies

The major player of the MBS is the three agencies: GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC (pronounced Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac). These agencies were established after the WW2 by the congress to provide affordable mortgages. Over the years, FNMA and FHLMC, after completing their missions, have become private and GNMA remains as public as it has been. That said, it is a general belief that FNMA and FHLMC are very much guaranteed by the government and 2008 proved it.

# Agency or Non-agency Based MBS

Agencies underwrite mortgages and these securities are known as agency RMBS. These RMBS must pass certain credit criteria (to name a few):

- LTV (loan to value) $\leq 0.8$
- PI (payment to income) $< \frac{1}{3}$
- FICO $> 620$

These mortgages are known as prime mortgages. Mortgages that do not pass these requirements cannot be underwritten by the agencies. They will have to be underwritten by private banks (e.g. Goldman Sachs). Hence non-agency RMBS are riskier.

Not only non-agency RMBS are more risky because of the borrowers are more likely to default, the underwriting banks are also subject to default risk. These mortgages are smaller in volume and hence these RMBS are less liquid as well.

# SMM

Investopedia:

Single monthly mortality (SMM) is a measure of the prepayment rate of a mortgage-backed security (MBS). As the term suggests, the single monthly mortality measures prepayment in a given month and is expressed as a percentage.

For investors of mortgage-backed securities, prepayment of mortgages is usually undesirable since future interest is foregone; investors prefer a lower or declining single monthly mortality on an MBS.

# CPR

Investopedia:

Single monthly mortality can be annualized into the constant prepayment rate (CPR), which gives the annual percentage rather than a monthly snapshot. MBS investors can switch between the two during important points in their holding's life span. For example, if interest rates decline over a period of time, an MBS investor will usually watch the SMM to see whether or not burnout is setting in.

Similarly, there are the first 30 months of a mortgage-backed security's life where it is considered "on the ramp" and during which SMM and CPR are expected to increase before leveling off once the MBS is "off the ramp" after 30 months. The caveat with the prepayment ramps is that they are based on the PSA model from the 1980s. Although the broad outline of this model holds up—mainly that there are two phases to an MBS lifespan—the mortgage market is a different place now, and public awareness of refinancing and interest rates is more ubiquitous than when the PSA model was created. The length of the ramps is believed to be much shorter now, as people are more likely to refinance when rates go down.

# CDR

The constant default rate (CDR) is the percentage of mortgages within a pool of loans in which the mortgagors (borrowers) have fallen more than 90 days behind in making payments to their lenders. These pools of individual outstanding mortgages are created by financial institutions that combine loans to create mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which they sell to investors.

The constant default rate (CDR) evaluates losses within mortgage-backed securities. The CDR is calculated on a monthly basis and is one of several measures that those investors look at in order to place a market value on an MBS. The method of analysis emphasizing the CDR can be used for adjustable-rate mortgages as well as fixed-rate mortgages.

The CDR can be expressed as a formula:

$$
C D R = 1 - \left(1 - \frac {D}{N D P}\right) ^ {n}
$$ where:


$D =$ Amount of new defaults during the period

NDP = Non-defaulted pool balance at the beginning of the period

$n =$ Number of periods per year


The constant default rate (CDR) is calculated as follows:

1. Take the number of new defaults during a period and divide by the non-defaulted pool balance at the start of that period.
2. Take 1 less the result from no. 1.
3. Raise that the result from no. 2 to the power based on the number of periods in the year.
4. And finally 1 less the result from no. 3.
5. It should be noted, though, that the constant default rate (CDR)'s formula can vary somewhat—that is, some analysts also include the scheduled payment and prepayment amounts.

Gargantua Bank has pooled residential mortgages on houses located across the U.S. into a mortgage-backed security. Gargantua's Director of Institutional Sales approaches portfolio managers at the Trustworthy Investment Company in hopes that Trustworthy will purchase an MBS to add to its portfolios that hold these types of securities.

After a meeting between Gargantua and his firm's investment team, one of Trustworthy's research analysts compares the CDR of Gargantua's MBS with that of a similarly rated MBS that another firm is offering to sell to Trustworthy. The analyst reports to his superiors that the CDR for Gargantua's MBS is significantly higher than that of the competitor's issue and he recommends that Trustworthy request a lower price from Gargantua to offset the poorer credit quality of the underlying mortgages in the pool.

Or consider Bank ABC, which saw \$1 million in new defaults for the fourth quarter of 2019. At the end of 20198, the bank's non-defaulted pool balance was \$100 million. Thus, the constant default rate (CDR) is  $4\%$ , or:


$$ 1 - \left(1 - \frac{\$1 \text{ million}}{\$100 \text{ million}}\right)^4 $$

In addition to considering the constant default rate (CDR), analysts may also look at the cumulative default rate (CDX), which reflects the total value of defaults within the pool, rather than an annualized monthly rate. Analysts and market participants are likely to place a higher value on mortgage-backed security that has a low CDR and CDX than on one with a higher rate of defaults.

# SDA

Another method for evaluating losses is the Standard Default Assumption (SDA) model created by the Bond Market Association, but this calculation is best suited to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. During the subprime meltdown of 2007-2008, the SDA model vastly underestimated the true default rate as foreclosure rates hit multi-decade highs.

According to http://pistulka.com by Don Pistulka (12/15/2014):

The SDA curve was developed by "The Bond Market Association". It is expressed in terms of CDR, but allows for different default rates, based upon a normal housing market. The premise is that the probability of default is low during the first months, peaks between 30 and 60 months, and then ramps down. During the housing crisis starting in 2007, it was the early months of the loan that had the highest probability of default, not the lowest. Like any curve, its usefulness will depend upon your outlook for the market.

The curve has some resemblance to the PSA prepayment model. The base curve is expressed as 100, but can be changed to increase or decrease the default rate. The base case for SDA assumes an initial CDR of 0.02% for the first month. It ramps up by 0.02% each month until the 30th month where it reaches a CDR of 0.6%. It remains at 0.6% until the 60th month. Then it starts decreasing at 0.0095% each month until it reaches month 120 at a CDR of 0.03% and stays at that level until the 360th month.

The following exhibit describes SDA pictorially:

# PSA

Public Securities Association (PSA) Prepayment Model, developed in 1985, is among the most widely used models.

Wikipedia:

The PSA Prepayment Model is a prepayment scale developed by the Public Securities Association in 1985 for analyzing American mortgage-backed securities. The PSA model assumes increasing prepayment rates for the first 30 months after mortgage origination and a constant prepayment rate thereafter.[1] This approximates real-world experience that during the first few years, mortgage borrowers: are less likely to relocate to a different home, are less likely to refinance into a new mortgage, and are less likely to make extra payments of principal. The standard model (also called "100% PSA") works as follows: Starting with an annualized prepayment rate of 0.2% in month 1, the rate increases by 0.2% each month, until it reaches 6% in month 30. From the 30th month onward, the model assumes an annualized prepayment rate of  $6\%$  of the remaining balance. Each monthly prepayment is assumed to represent full payoff of individual loans, rather than a partial prepayment that leaves a loan with a reduced principal balance.


Variations of the model are expressed in percent; e.g., "150% PSA" means a monthly increase of 0.3% in the annualized prepayment rate, until the peak of 9% is reached after 30 months. The months thereafter have a constant annualized prepayment rate of 9%.

1667% PSA is roughly equivalent to 100% prepayment rate in month 30 or later.

# FHA Experience

Wikipedia:

An FHA insured loan is a US Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance backed mortgage loan that is provided by an FHA-approved lender. FHA insured loans are a type of federal assistance. They have historically allowed lower-income Americans to borrow money to purchase a home that they would not otherwise be able to afford. Because this type of loan is more geared towards new house owners than real estate investors, FHA loans are different from conventional loans in the sense that the house must be owner-occupant for at least a year.[1] Since loans with lower down-payments usually involve more risk to the lender, the home-buyer must pay a two-part mortgage insurance that involves a one-time bulk payment and a monthly payment to compensate for the increased risk.

# Mortgage Coupon

Investopedia:

A current coupon refers to a security that is trading closest to its par value without going over par. In other words, the bond's market price is at or near to its issued face value.

Put differently, a bond has a current coupon status if its coupon is set approximately equal to the bond's yield to maturity (YTM) at the time of issuance. The concept is often used in pricing yield spreads among mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

The current coupon is commonly used to understand yield spreads of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) which are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the government agency Ginnie Mae.1 As the underlying mortgages of MBSs have different interest rates, various MBSs will have different coupons.

In the MBS market, a current coupon is defined as the to-be-announced (TBA) mortgage security of any issue for the current delivery month that is trading closest to, but not exceeding par value. A TBA qualification means that the pool of mortgages that will back the security has not been assigned, even though the contract is about to be made. A synthetic 30-year fixed-rate MBS in the TBA market is the current coupon used as a benchmark throughout the industry to price and value mortgages.

Determining the MBS Current Coupon

To determine which security is the current coupon, it is necessary to know the par value of the mortgages, which is the sum of the outstanding principals on the underlying mortgages. The current coupon is calculated by interpolating the highest coupon below par and the lowest coupon above par, adjusting for the delay days associated with the securities in question.

Alternatively, it is obtained by extrapolating from the lowest coupon above par in case no coupon is trading below par. For example, TBA mortgage securities often trade with interest rates in increments of 0.5%. Therefore, assuming a par value of 100, if Fannie Mae 8% mortgage securities are trading at 99.5 and Fannie Mae 8.5% mortgage securities are trading at 100.75, Fannie Mae's 8% security would be the current coupon.

Special Considerations

A principle of mortgage analysis is that the higher a mortgage-backed security's coupon is relative to the current coupon, the more likely that mortgage-backed security is to prepay. Mortgage investors make this relative value analysis in calculating MBS yields and valuations. In addition, the current coupon reflects the state of the mortgage market. Thus, lenders and borrowers can use it as an indicator of what the fair rate for new mortgages should be.


# WAC, WAM, WALA, WAL

WAM/WALA are very similar to duration.

Weighted average maturity (WAM) is the weighted average amount of time until the maturities on mortgages in a mortgage-backed security (MBS). This term is used more broadly to describe maturities in a portfolio of debt securities, including corporate debt and municipal bonds. The higher the WAM, the longer it takes for all of the mortgages or bonds in the portfolio to mature. WAM is used to manage debt portfolios and to assess the performance of debt portfolio managers.

The weighted average loan age (WALA) measures the average age of the loans in a pool of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The weights are based on the dollar amount of each loan at each maturity in proportion to the aggregate total of the pool and can be weighted on the remaining principal balance dollar figure or the nominal value of the loan.

The weighted average life (WAL) is the average length of time that each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan, a mortgage, or an amortizing bond remains outstanding. Calculating WAL shows an investor, an analyst, or a portfolio manager how many years it will take to receive roughly half of the amount of the outstanding principal. The formula is useful in measuring the credit risk associated with fixed-income securities.

# 12.1.2 CMBS

Commercial mortgage backed securities refer to securities that are products of securitizing commercial mortgage loans. These loans are made out to commercial real estate properties such as rental apartments, hotels, casinos, etc. that earn rental incomes. Hence, the cash flows paid out to the investors do not come from salaries or wages of the borrowers but from the rental revenues.

In addition, CMBS are not securitized by agencies and hence defaults are not guaranteed. Consequently, CMBS suffer credit risk. Contrary to RMBS, CMBS investors are guaranteed a certain period of interests, known as the "yield maintenance" period. During this period, borrowers cannot prepay (or subject to a high prepayment penalty which is prohibited by law in RMBS).


# 12.1.3 ABS

Asset backed securities include everything that is not an RMBS or CMBS. They suffer from both prepayment and credit risks.

# 12.2 Securitization Process

Figure 12.5 demonstrates how the securitization process looks like. In the primary market, individuals borrow money to buy their homes (so these loans are collateralized) from either commercial (BoA) or mortgage-specialized banks (e.g. Norwest).

The banks that make the loans can decide to keep the loans for themselves (and make a handsome spread) or sell them to the agencies. If latter, then these loans will go through the underwriting process held by the agencies. In the process, the agencies will sell these loans to a chosen set of dealers (also banks, and could be the same banks as those that made the loans earlier). These dealers (banks) have a retail channel to sell these MBS to their clients.

# 12.3 RMBS

# 12.3.1 Paththroughs

# Investopedia:

"A pass-through security is a pool of fixed-income securities backed by a package of assets. A servicing intermediary collects the monthly payments from issuers and, after deducting a fee, remits or passes them through to the holders of the pass-through security (that is, people or entities who have invested in it). A pass-through security is also known as a "pay-through security" or a "pass-through certificate"—though technically the certificate is the evidence of interest or participation in a pool of assets that signifies the transfer of payments to investors; it's not the security itself."

In the secondary market, various types of RMBS are sold. The first type is a passthrough structure, as in Figure fig:pt. A passthrough (PT) RMBS is, as its name suggests, like a tiny mortgage. The agencies collect similar demographic mortgages (hence homogeneous) and divide them up equally.

This is known as the vertical partition.

# 12.3.2 CMO

Investopedia:

"A collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) refers to a type of mortgage-backed security that contains a pool of mortgages bundled together and sold as an investment. Organized by maturity and level of risk, CMOs receive cash flows as borrowers repay the mortgages that act as collateral on these securities. In turn, CMOs distribute principal and interest payments to their investors based on predetermined rules and agreements."

This is a horizontal partition.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/50a83d59-0129-4701-a939-9f0396f0b64f/a8a09149a1b965a3392e22738f7bcce22a78f9c123df7b49189ca6c3167d31a1.jpg)
Figure 12.7: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations

Like CMOs, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) consist of a group of loans bundled together and sold as an investment vehicle. However, whereas CMOs only contain mortgages, CDOs contain a range of loans such as car loans, credit cards, commercial loans, and even mortgages. Both CDOs and CMOs peaked in 2007 just before the global financial crisis, and their values fell sharply after that time. For example, at its peak in 2007, the CDO market was worth \$1.3 trillion, compared to\$850 million in 2013.

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and the Global Financial Crisis

First issued by Salomon Brothers and First Boston in 1983, CMOs were complex and involved many different mortgages. For many reasons, investors were more likely to focus on the income streams offered by CMOs rather than the health of the underlying mortgages themselves. As a result, many investors purchased CMOs full of subprime mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgages held by borrowers whose income wasn't verified during the application process, and other risky mortgages with high risks of default.

The use of CMOs has been criticized as a precipitating factor in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Rising housing prices made mortgages look like fail-proof investments, enticing investors to buy CMOs and other MBSs, but market and economic conditions led to a rise in foreclosures and payment risks that financial models did not accurately predict. The aftermath of the global financial crisis resulted in increased regulations for mortgage-backed securities. Most recently, in December 2016, the SEC and FINRA introduced new regulations that mitigate the risk of these securities by creating margin requirements for covered agency transactions, including collateralized mortgage obligations.

# 12.3.3 Interest Only and Principle Only

The partition can be diagonal too. Figure 12.8

# 12.4 CMBS

Investopedia:

# Types of CMBS

The mortgages that back CMBS are classified into tranches according to their levels of credit risk, which typically are ranked from senior—or highest quality—to lower quality. The highest quality tranches will receive both interest and principal payments and have the lowest associated risk. Lower tranches offer higher interest rates, but the tranches that take on more risk also absorb most of the potential loss that can occur as the tranches go down in rank.

The lowest tranche in a CMBS structure will contain the riskiest—and possibly speculative—loans in the portfolio. The securitization process that's involved in designing a CMBS's structure is important for both banks and investors. It allows banks to issue more loans in total, and it gives investors easy access to commercial real estate while giving them more yield than traditional government bonds.

Investors should understand, however, that in the case of a default on one or more loans in a CMBS, the highest tranches must be fully paid off, with interest, before the lower tranches will receive any funds.

# Criticism of CMBS

Typically, only very wealthy investors invest in CMBS because there are not many options here for the average investor. It's difficult to find mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETF) that invest solely in this asset class, though many real estate mutual funds invest a portion of their portfolios into CMBS.

# Requirements for CMBS

In December 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) introduced new regulations to mitigate some of the risks of CMBS by creating margin requirements for covered agency transactions, including collateralized mortgage obligations.

# 12.5 ABS

Asset backed securities (ABS) are "leftovers" securitized products from the RMBS and CMBS. It includes everything from subprime mortgages to credit card loans.

# 12.5.1 Subprime (Alt-A)

# What Is Subprime?

Subprime is a below-average credit classification of borrowers with a tarnished or limited credit history, and which are subject to higher than average interest rates.

Lenders will use a credit scoring system to determine which loans a borrower may qualify for. Subprime loans carry more credit risk, and as such, will carry higher interest rates as well.

KEY TAKEAWAYS Subprime refers to borrowers or loans, usually offered at rates well above the prime rate, that have poor credit ratings.

Subprime lending is higher risk, given the lower credit rating of borrowers, and has in the past contributed to financial crises.

Subprime makes up about one-quarter of the domestic housing market, but subprime products may also include non-mortgage loans and credit.

Investopedia:

An alt-A mortgage lands somewhere in between a prime and subprime mortgage. Borrowers who have higher credit scores and have lower interest rates get prime mortgages. Subprime mortgages are offered to borrowers with lower credit scores and have higher interest rates. Alt-A mortgages fall in between in prime and subprime mortgages in terms of risk and interest rates.

One of the higher risks associated with Alt-A loans is less loan documentation. These types of loans were especially prominent leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Lenders of Alt-A loans issued these loans without significant documentation of income and nor verification of employment from the borrower. Alt-A loans were a substantial factor leading to the subprime crisis which reached its peak in 2008 with many borrowers defaulting on their mortgage loans. Dodd-Frank regulations, implemented as a reaction to the fallout from the crisis, has helped improved documentation and verification weaknesses prevalent prior to these new rules.

Dodd-Frank regulations require greater documentation on all types of loans (specifically mortgages). The legislation has instituted provisions for qualified mortgages, which are high-quality mortgages that meet specific standards and thus qualify for special treatment in both the primary and secondary market.

# 12.5.2 Home Equity

A home equity loan—also known as an equity loan, home equity installment loan, or second mortgage—is a type of consumer debt. Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their home. The loan amount is based on the difference between the home's current market value and the homeowner's mortgage balance due. Home equity loans tend to be fixed-rate, while the typical alternative, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), generally have variable rates.

KEY TAKEAWAYS A home equity loan, also known as a "home equity in stallment loan" or a "second mortgage," is a type of consumer debt.


Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their residence. Home equity loan amounts are based on the difference between a home's current market value and the mortgage balance due.

Home equity loans come in two varieties—fixed-rate loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Fixed-rate home equity loans provide one lump sum, whereas HELOCs offer borrowers revolving lines of credit.

# Auto Floorplan https://www.nextgearcapital.com/news/how-does-floor-plan-financing-work/


https://www.nextgearcapital.com/news/how-to-begin-a-car-dealership-floor-plan-nextgear-capital/

The terms "floor planning" and "floor plan financing" get thrown around pretty frequently in dealership and auction circles. But what do these terms really mean and how does floor plan financing work?

To put it in the simplest terms, floor planning and floor plan financing work almost like a credit card made solely for purchasing vehicle inventory.

Credit cards are issued by a bank to an individual. Individuals can then buy personal goods with the money loaned from the bank. The money borrowed from the bank collects interest, and one has the choice to either make a minimum payment or pay off the balance in full when the bill is due.

So how does floor plan financing work?

Much like a credit card, a floor plan financing company extends a line of credit to a car dealer. Dealers can then use their floor plan line of credit to purchase inventory from auctions and other inventory sources. If a dealer purchases a car on a floor plan, takes it back to their lot and it doesn't sell within a contractually determined number of days, dealers are charged a small fee. As a dealer sells their inventory, they pay back the original loan.

With a floor plan, the initial investment needed to buy a particular unit is a fraction of the vehicle's actual purchase price. As soon as that vehicle sells to a consumer, floor planning dealers have the ability to immediately realize profits, pay back the initial value of the loan plus interest and fees, and had the flexibility to keep their funds working for their dealership.

How does floor plan financing work specifically to benefit auto dealers?

Floor plan finance companies are uniquely attuned to the needs of auto dealers. Using cash or a bank line of credit to purchase inventory can work for some car dealers, but many floor plan financing companies offer a variety of dealer-specific benefits. In addition to freeing up the cash a dealer has on hand, other floor plan financing benefits can include extra flexibility in terms of paying off a particular piece of inventory, payment extensions and credit increases if necessary. Other services are also frequently offered which can include records management, title services depending on the dealer's state, collateral protection and state-of-the-art online and mobile account management tools.

Though floor plan financing can seem like a confusing concept, in practice it can be an extremely beneficial business strategy for automotive dealers.

Asset-backed securitization allows receivables holders of any kind to transfer their revenue streams to investors. The practice began with computer leases in the 1980s. Today the market includes collateral types ranging from cell phone tower leases to heavy industrial equipment to retail lending products and commercial loans.

Credit cards asset-backed securities (ABS) are a means for large issuers and lenders to sell blocks of their portfolios to investors. This allows issuers to retain servicing rights and generate fee income.

As accounts move off the financial institution's books, the issuers can continue their marketing activity, book new accounts, and reinvest the funds. Large issuers thus become marketing machines.

Issuers are not permitted to sell all their receivables to financial markets and must retain some risk. This regulatory standard requiring them to have som "skin is in the game" ensures prudent lending.

Small and middle-market lenders do not have a large enough number of cards for the ABS market, which is intended for sophisticated investors. Interest and non-interest revenue streams drive portfolio value, subclassified as risk-based tranches, that trade on the average of 800 million. Volumes this large are far beyond the realm of issuers below the top 15 credit card lenders in the United States. For practical purposes, the market has not seen an attempt to cobble together an offering from different financial institutions.

The ABS market froze during the Great Recession as investors lost confidence in the quality, and assessment of quality, of the receivables. Although mortgage-backed securities got the most attention, total credit card securitizations also dropped, from \$94.4 billion in 2007 to just\$6.2 billion in 2010. The Federal Reserve restored confidence in capital markets with an emergency institutional lending procedure, Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) also addressed the unstable market.


The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010 helped to restore confidence in the ABS market by addressing investors' concerns about the quality of underlying assets, the reliability of rating agency reports, and clarity on how funds would distribute as debtors made their regular payments. Clearer disclosures were required, along with transparent views of the underlying collateral used to secure the markets.

Asset securitizations continue in the U.S. market with more confidence now. For all asset classes, more than  \$1 trillion is in the market, with\$ 28 billion sourced in the U.S. credit card market during 2018. This is still far below the \$2 trillion mark reached just before the 2008 financial crisis though. While cards do not dominate the general ABS market, the channel has placed more than \$225 billion into the market since 2012.

# Wikipedia:

Film finance is an aspect of film production that occurs during the development stage prior to pre-production, and is concerned with determining the potential value of a proposed film. In the United States, the value is typically based on a forecast of revenues (generally 10 years for films and 20 years for television shows), beginning with theatrical release, and including DVD sales, and release to cable broadcast television networks both domestic and international and inflight airline licensing.

# 12.6 Other Real Estate Derivatives

Mortgages are loans and hence usually regarded as interest rate derivatives. Yet, mortgages are loans made out to purchasing real estate properties. As a result, MBS also inherit all the risks of their underlying real estate properties and can be regarded as RE derivatives.

In this section, we should discuss other real estate derivatives. These securities are tied closely to real estate properties.

# Wikipedia:

A property derivative is a financial derivative whose value is derived from the value of an underlying real estate asset. In practice, because individual real estate assets fall victim to market inefficiencies and are hard to accurately price, property derivative contracts are typically written based on a real estate property index. In turn, the real estate property index attempts to aggregate real estate market information to provide a more accurate representation of underlying real estate asset performance. Trading or taking positions in property derivatives is also known as synthetic real estate.

# 12.6.1 Case-Shiller Index Futures

# Wikipedia:

The Standard & Poor's CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are repeat-sales house price indices for the United States. There are multiple Case-Shiller home price indices: A national home price index, a 20-city composite index, a 10-city composite index, and twenty individual metro area indices. These indices are calculated and kept monthly by Standard & Poor's, with data points calculated for the time period of January 1987 through the present. The indices kept by Standard & Poor are normalized to have a value of 100 in January 2000. These Indices are based on original work by economists Karl Case and Robert Shiller, in which their team calculated the home price index back to 1890. That index is normalized as such that 1890 has a value of 100. The Case-Shiller Index being kept on Shiller's website is updated quarterly.[1] Due to the different set reference points, and perhaps calculation differences, the index numbers provided in each data set can be very different. For example, in 4th quarter 2013, the Standard and Poor 20 city index point was in the 160's, while the index point for 4th quarter on the Shiller data was in the 130's. Shiller claims in his book Irrational Exuberance that such a long series of home prices does not appear to have been published for any country.

# 12.6.2 RPX Swap and Forward Contracts https://realtytimes.com/headlines/item/6432-20070926_rpxmeasure


Another measure of the housing market began operating last week when trading in a new derivative known at the Residential Property Index, or RPX, got underway.

Created by Radar Logic Inc., New York, the index is based on single values representing price per square foot on actual residential real estate transactions in 25 metropolitan areas. Trading also will be available in a 25-city composite.

Dealers licensed to offer products in the RPX market include Morgan Stanley, Lehman Bros., Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns.

Radar Logic, which bills itself as "the home of tradable real estate," is a technology-driven data and analytics business that produces a daily "spot" price for residential real estate in U.S. metropolitan areas.

At nearly 23 trillion, according to the latest figures from the Federal Reserve Board, the value of U.S. housing is significantly larger than that of stocks and rivals that of fixed income. But because of its illiquid nature, methods for investing and trading in real estate essentially have been limited to buying, holding and selling individual properties.

With the new derivative, however, investors will be able to take positions on the value of the residential property market, creating liquid and efficient opportunities similar to those available for more traditional commodities, said Radar Logic's president, Michael Feder.

"The launch of the RPX market provides both investors and participants in the real estate industry with sophisticated tools that have not been available to them before," Feder said. "The granular applications of the RPX-based derivatives should allow substantial utility for all interested participants."


The company produces daily prices for housing in the 25 markets by capturing actual transaction data and translating the information into the Radar Logic Daily Prices. The Daily Prices, in turn, power the RPX market, where derivatives and other financial instruments are offered and traded.

RPX allows real estate and financial professionals to manage risk, invest in real estate without owning physical assets, and obtain more accurate insight into the residential property market, the company maintains.

Tony Tufariello, global head of the securitized products group at Morgan Stanley, said the derivatives "should provide an essential and timely investment and risk management tool for our institutional and individual clients by offering them the opportunity to express a long or short view on home price changes across the U.S."

Scott Soltas, the managing director and head of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Sales and Trading, believes that at least initially, RPX trading will be centered around price return " swaps" and simple forward contracts.

Both instruments will be quoted in terms of home price appreciation (HPA) and will vary in length from one to five years. "The variety and flexibility provided by these contracts will enable investors to quickly and easily express views on specific property markets for their desired length of time," Soltas said.

Rich McKinney, head of Residential MBS Trading at Lehman Brothers, said investors holding securities sensitive to mortgage credit and prepayment performance as well as businesses with exposure to the housing market cycles can use these instruments to hedge their housing exposure.

"Given the current volatility in the housing market, the product launch is extremely well timed," McKinney said.

In addition to generating daily RPX prices, Radar Logic has developed a series of analytic tools designed to help professionals in both the real estate and financial services industries utilize these derivatives.

# 12.6.3 REIT

What Is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)? A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.


# KEY TAKEAWAYS

A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing properties. REITs generate a steady income stream for investors but offer little in the way of capital appreciation. Most REITs are publicly traded like stocks, which makes them highly liquid (unlike physical real estate investments).

REITs invest in most real estate property types, including apartment buildings, cell towers, data centers, hotels, medical facilities, offices, retail centers, and warehouses.

# 12.6.4 REMIC

# Wikipedia:

"A real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) is "an entity that holds a fixed pool of mortgages and issues multiple classes of interests in itself to investors" under U.S. Federal income tax law and is "treated like a partnership for Federal income tax purposes with its income passed through to its interest holders". REMICs are used for the pooling of mortgage loans and issuance of mortgage-backed securities and have been a key contributor to the success of the mortgage-backed securities market over the past several decades.

The federal income taxation of REMICs is governed primarily under 26 U.S.C. §860A-860G of Part IV of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.). To qualify as a REMIC, an organization makes an "election" to do so by filing a Form 1066 with the Internal Revenue Service, and by meeting certain other requirements. They were introduced in 1987 as the typical vehicle for the securitization of residential mortgages in the United States."
