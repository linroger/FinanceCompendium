What is repo?  
Fixed Income Trading, also known as期权，是a type of short-term borrowing in which counterparties obtain cash or paying collateral. Changers such as hedge funds, investment banks, and real estate investors are often involved in the market. Marketable securities (MBS) hold the rather side of the deal for seeking a profit. In most cases, a券商 is a large bank unit as an intermediary between the parties to facilitate transactions.

The first signs of the financial crisis bubbled up in this center of the repository, also identified as the 'Walled Street' floor in the press, when dealers could no longer sell their securities.

After Lehmann Brothers failed, banks and regulators recognized the risks associated with market failure. The Bank of New York (BNY) was a major bank capital requirement, as its Basel's Voluntary Ratio and the Global Systemically Important Risk Management Guidelines (GARP) were designed to support banks' expectations associated with second lending. In response, dealer transactions in the repo market have declined and the way banks fund themselves has fundamentally been altered. As Bernanke points out, the gross value of the repo market now stands at approximately  \$1.51 trillion, according to the Fitch's most recent primary dealer financing data. Of these three deals, which is a where a dealer lends money in exchange for bonds—accounts for\$ 2.1 billion

What is sponsored repo?

Sponsor's reply: a website in which a sponsor's non-dealer partners sell fixed income Cheating Corporation's (FICC) closed-ended platform—a system that provides the same level of information as the FICC.

In a typical matched-backs resale, this dealer would borrow  \$100 from a cash transfer bank (e.g., a money market fund) and then he could sell the proceeds to a cash transfer bank (e.g., a hedge fund) in exchange for collateral. As part of this, his dealer would have to put up his own capital against\$ 100 of repayment.

In sponsored eyes, IFC Intermediate divides both sides of the trade, thereby allowing sales to net the transactions of against each other. This means the amount of capital banks have to hold is greatly decreased, allowing sales to provide more balance sheet to clients or deploy capital towards other operations.

In the near-term, FICC is expected to receive approval from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to expand its cleaned repo platform to other counterparties.

But this is inside limited, with FICC accepting how much non-bank members can engage in the same activities as those who are not. The FICC has a special interest in "well-capitalized" Bank融资业务 such as U.S. SIBs.
