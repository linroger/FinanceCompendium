# Insurance Companies and Pension Plans

The role of insurance companies is to provide protection against adverse events. The company or individual seeking protection is referred to as the policyholder. The policyholder makes regular payments, known as premiums, and receives payments from the insurance company if certain specified events occur. Insurance is usually classified as life insurance and nonlife insurance, with health insurance often considered to be a separate category. Nonlife insurance is also referred to as property-casualty insurance, and this is the terminology we will use here.

A life insurance contract typically lasts a long time and provides payments to the policyholder's beneficiaries that depend on when the policyholder dies. A property-casualty insurance contract typically lasts one year (although it may be renewed) and provides compensation for losses from accidents, fire, theft, and so on.

Insurance has existed for many years. As long ago as 200 B.C., there was an arrangement in ancient Greece where an individual could make a lump-sum payment (the amount dependent on his or her age) and obtain a monthly income for life. The Romans had a form of life insurance where an individual could purchase a contract that would provide a payment to relatives on his or her death. In ancient China, a form of property-casualty insurance existed between merchants where, if the ship of one merchant sank, the rest of the merchants would provide compensation.

An employer pension plan is a form of insurance arranged by a company for its employees. It is designed to provide the employees with income for the rest of their lives once they have retired. Typically both the company and its employees make regular monthly contributions to the plan and the funds in the plan are invested to provide income for retirees.

This chapter describes how the contracts offered by insurance companies work. It explains the risks that insurance companies face and the way they are regulated. It also discusses key issues associated with pension plans.

# 3.1 Life Insurance

In life insurance contracts, the payments to the policyholder depend—at least to some extent—on when the policyholder dies. Outside the United States, the term life assurance is often used to describe a contract where the event being insured against is certain to happen at some future time (e.g., a contract that will pay 100,000 on the policyholder's death). Life insurance is used to describe a contract where the event being insured against may never happen (for example, a contract that provides a payoff in the event of the accidental death of the policyholder). In the United States, all types of life policies are referred to as life insurance and this is the terminology that will be adopted here.

There are many different types of life insurance products. The products available vary from country to country. We will now describe some of the more common ones.

# 3.1.1 Term Life Insurance

Term life insurance (sometimes referred to as temporary life insurance) lasts a predetermined number of years. If the policyholder dies during the life of the policy, the insurance company makes a payment to the specified beneficiaries equal to the face amount of the policy. If the policyholder does not die during the term of the policy, no payments are made by the insurance company. The policyholder is required to make regular monthly or annual premium payments (usually constant predetermined amounts) to the insurance company for the life of the policy or until the policyholder's death (whichever is earlier). The face amount of the policy typically stays the same or declines with the passage of time. A policy where the premium per year is not constant is an annual renewable term policy. In this, the insurance company guarantees to renew the policy from one year to the next at a rate reflecting the policyholder's age without regard to the policyholder's health.

A common reason for term life insurance is a mortgage. For example, a person age 35 with a 25-year mortgage might choose to buy 25-year term insurance (with a declining face amount) to provide dependents with the funds to pay off the mortgage in the event of his or her death.

# 3.1.2 Whole Life Insurance

Whole life insurance (sometimes referred to as permanent life insurance) provides protection for the life of the policyholder. The policyholder is required to make regular monthly or annual payments until his or her death. The face value of the policy is then paid to the designated beneficiary. In the case of term life insurance, there is no certainty that there will be a payout, but in the case of whole life insurance, a payout is certain to happen providing the policyholder continues to make the agreed premium payments. The only uncertainty is when the payout will occur. Not surprisingly, whole life insurance requires considerably higher premiums than term life insurance policies. Usually, the payments and the face value of the policy both remain constant through time.

Policyholders can often redeem (surrender) whole life policies early or use the policies as collateral for loans. When a policyholder wants to redeem a whole life policy early, it is sometimes the case that an investor will buy the policy from the policyholder for more than the surrender value offered by the insurance company. The investor will then make the premium payments and collect the face value from the insurance company when the policyholder dies.

Suppose a man buys  $1 million of whole life insurance at age 40 and that the premium is$ 15,000 per year. In the first year, the policy will on average cost the insurance company much less than $15,000. As we will see later, an estimate of the probability of a male aged 40 dying within one year is 0.002581. The expected cost to the insurance company in the first year is therefore  $1,000,000 \times 0.002581$  or  $\$2,581$ . There is therefore an expected cash inflow of  $\$12,419$  to the insurance company in the first year. Assuming that the policy holder does not die in the first year, a premium of  $\$15,000$  is paid at the beginning of the second year. The probability of a man aged 41 dying within one year is 0.002697. This means that there is an expected cash inflow of  $\$12,303$  in the second year. The expected costs of one-year premiums continue to rise as the individual gets older and at some stage the expected cost of the policy in a year becomes greater than  $\$15,000$ . For example, assuming the man has not already died, he will pay a premium of  $\$15,000$  when he reaches 70 and have a probability of 0.022364 of dying within a year. This means that there is an expected cash outflow to the insurance company of  $\$22,364$  less  $\$15,000$  or  $\$7,364$ . This expected cash outflow, as seen at the beginning of the life of the policy, is  $\$7,364$  times the probability that a man aged 40 is still alive after 30 years, which turns out to be  $\$5,634$ . The year-by-year (undiscounted) expected cash flows, estimated at beginning of the policy, are shown in Figure 3.1. The insurance company has expected cash inflows, which we will refer to as surplus premiums, for the first 24 years. After that the expected cash flow in a year is negative. (Note that by the 60th year of the policy the expected cash flow is close to zero because the probability that the policy holder is still alive then is small.) Figure 3.1 shows that there is a savings element to whole life insurance. In the early years, expected surpluses can be invested to cover later expected payouts.

There are tax advantages associated with life insurance policies in many countries. If the policyholder invested the surplus premiums instead of paying them to the insurance company, tax would normally be payable on the income as it was earned. But, when the surplus premiums are invested within the insurance policy, the tax treatment is often better. Tax is deferred, and sometimes the payout to the beneficiaries of life insurance policies is free of income tax altogether.

# 3.1.3 Variable Life Insurance

Given that a whole life insurance policy involves funds being invested for the policyholder, a natural development is to allow the policyholder to specify how the funds are invested. Variable life (VL) insurance is a form of whole life insurance where the surplus premiums discussed earlier are invested in a fund chosen by the policyholder. This could be an equity fund, a bond fund, or a money market fund. A minimum guaranteed payout on death is usually specified, but the payout can be more if the fund does well. Income earned from the investments can sometimes be applied toward the premiums. The policyholder can usually switch from one fund to another at any time.

# 3.1.4 Universal Life

Universal life (UL) insurance is also a form of whole life insurance. The policyholder can reduce the premium down to a specified minimum without the policy lapsing. The surplus premiums are invested by the insurance company in fixed income products such as bonds, mortgages, and money market instruments. The insurance company guarantees a certain minimum return, say  $4\%$ , on these funds. The policyholder can choose between two options. Under the first option, a fixed benefit is paid on death; under the second option, the policyholder's beneficiaries receive more than the fixed benefit if the investment return is greater than the guaranteed minimum. Needless to say, premiums are lower for the first option.

# 3.1.5 Variable-Universal Life Insurance

Variable-universal life (VUL) insurance blends the features found in variable life insurance and universal life insurance. The policyholder can choose between a number of alternatives for the investment of surplus premiums. The insurance company guarantees a certain minimum death benefit and interest on the investments can sometimes be applied toward premiums. Premiums can be reduced down to a specified minimum without the policy lapsing.

# 3.1.6 Endowment Life Insurance

Endowment life insurance lasts for a specified period and pays a lump sum either when the policyholder dies or at the end of the period, whichever is first. There are many different types of endowment life insurance contracts. The amount that is paid out can be specified in advance as the same regardless of whether the policyholder dies or survives to the end of the policy. Sometimes the payout is also made if the policyholder has a critical illness. In a with-profits endowment life insurance policy, the insurance company declares periodic bonuses that depend on the performance of the insurance company's investments. These bonuses accumulate to increase the amount paid out to the policyholder, assuming the policyholder lives beyond the end of the life of the policy. In a unit-linked endowment, the amount paid out at maturity depends on the performance of the fund chosen by the policyholder. A pure endowment policy has the property that a payout occurs only if the policyholder survives to the end of the life of the policy.

# 3.1.7 Group Life Insurance

Group life insurance covers many people under a single policy. It is often purchased by a company for its employees. The policy may be contributory, where the premium payments are shared by the employer and employee, or noncontributory, where the employer pays the whole of the cost. There are economies of scale in group life insurance. The selling and administration costs are lower. An individual is usually required to undergo medical tests when purchasing life insurance in the usual way, but this may not be necessary for group life insurance. The insurance company knows that it will be taking on some better-than-average risks and some worse-than-average risks.

# 3.2 Annuity Contracts

Many life insurance companies also offer annuity contracts. While a life insurance contract has the effect of converting regular payments into a lump sum, an annuity contract has the opposite effect: that of converting a lump sum into regular payments. In a typical arrangement, the policyholder makes a lump-sum payment to the insurance company and the insurance company agrees to provide the policyholder with an annuity that starts at a particular date and lasts for the rest of the policyholder's life. In some instances, the annuity starts immediately after the lump-sum payment by the policyholder. In other cases, the lump-sum payment is made by the policyholder several years ahead of the time when the annuity is to start and the insurance company invests the funds to create the annuity. (This is referred to as a deferred annuity.) Instead of a lump sum, the policy-holder sometimes saves for the annuity by making regular monthly, quarterly, or annual payments to the insurance company.

There are often tax deferral advantages to the policyholder. This is because taxes usually have to be paid only when the annuity income is received. The amount to which the funds invested by the insurance company on behalf of the policyholder have grown in value is sometimes referred to as the accumulation value. Funds can usually be withdrawn early, but there are liable to be penalties. In other words, the surrender value of an annuity contract is typically less than the accumulation value. This is because the insurance company has to recover selling and administration costs. Policies sometimes allow penalty-free withdrawals where a certain percentage of the accumulation value or a certain percentage of the original investment can be withdrawn in a year without penalty. In the event that the policyholder dies before the start of the annuity (and sometimes in other circumstances such as when the policyholder is admitted to a nursing home), the full accumulation value can often be withdrawn without penalty.

Some deferred annuity contracts in the United States have embedded options. The accumulation value is sometimes calculated so that it tracks a particular equity index, such as the S&P 500. Lower and upper limits are specified. If the growth in the index in a year is less than the lower limit, the accumulation value grows at the lower limit rate; if it is greater than the upper limit, the accumulation value grows at the upper limit rate; otherwise it grows at the same rate as the S&P 500. Suppose that the lower limit is  $0\%$  and the upper limit is  $8\%$ . The policyholder is assured that the accumulation value will never decline, but index growth rates in excess of  $8\%$  are given up. In this type of arrangement, the policyholder is typically not compensated for dividends that would be received from an investment in the stocks underlying the index and the insurance company may be able to change parameters such as the lower limit and the upper limit from one year to the next. These types of contracts appeal to investors who want an exposure to the equity market but are reluctant to risk a decline in their accumulation value. Sometimes, the way the accumulation value grows from one year to the next is a quite complicated function of the performance of the index during the year.

In the United Kingdom, the annuity contracts offered by insurance companies used to guarantee a minimum level for the interest rate used for the calculation of the size of the annuity payments. Many insurance companies regarded this guarantee—an interest rate option granted to the policyholder—as a necessary marketing cost and did not calculate the cost of the option or hedge their risks. As interest rates declined and life expectancies increased, many insurance companies found themselves in financial difficulties and, as described in Business Snapshot 3.1, at least one of them went bankrupt.

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 3.1

# Equitable Life

Equitable Life was a British life insurance company founded in 1762 that at its peak had 1.5 million policyholders. Starting in the 1950s, Equitable Life sold annuity products where it guaranteed that the interest rate used to calculate the size of the annuity payments would be above a certain level. (This is known as a Guaranteed Annuity Option, GAO.) The guaranteed interest rate was gradually increased in response to competitive pressures and increasing interest rates. Toward the end of 1993, interest rates started to fall. Also, life expectancies were rising so that the insurance companies had to make increasingly high provisions for future payouts on contracts. Equitable Life did not take action. Instead, it grew by selling new products. In 2000, it was forced to close its doors to new business. A report issued by Ann Abraham in July 2008 was highly critical of regulators and urged compensation for policyholders.

An interesting aside to this is that regulators did at one point urge insurance companies that offered GAOs to hedge their exposures to an interest rate decline. As a result, many insurance companies scrambled to enter into contracts with banks that paid off if long-term interest rates declined. The banks in turn hedged their risk by buying instruments such as bonds that increased in price when rates fell. This was done on such a massive scale that the extra demand for bonds caused long-term interest rates in the UK to decline sharply (increasing losses for insurance companies on the unhedged part of their exposures). This shows that when large numbers of different companies have similar exposures, problems are created if they all decide to hedge at the same time. There are not likely to be enough investors willing to take on their risks without market prices changing.

# 3.3 Mortality Tables

Mortality tables are the key to valuing life insurance contracts. Table 3.1 shows an extract from the mortality rates estimated by the U.S. Department of Social Security from statistics on death rates as a function of age collected in 2019. To understand the table, consider the row corresponding to age 31. The second column shows that the probability of a man who has just reached age 31 dying within the next year is 0.001860 (or  $0.1860\%$ ). The third column shows that the probability of a man surviving to age 31 is 0.97196 (or  $97.196\%$ ). The fourth column shows that a man age 31 has a remaining life expectancy

The full table shows that the probability of death during the following year is a decreasing function of age for the first 10 years of life and then starts to increase. Mortality statistics for women are a little more favorable than for men. If a man is lucky enough to reach age 90, the probability of death in the next year is about  $16.2\%$ . The full table shows this probability is about  $34.8\%$  at age 100 and  $56.7\%$  at age 110. For women, the corresponding probabilities are  $12.9\%$ ,  $29.9\%$ , and  $53.6\%$ , respectively.

All the numbers in the table can be calculated from the "Probability of Death within 1 Year" column. The probability that an individual will survive to age  $n + 1$  is the probability that the individual will survive to age  $n$  multiplied by 1 minus the probability that an individual aged  $n$  will die within the next year. For example, the probability of surviving to age 61 can be calculated as  $0.85506 \times (1 - 0.11447)$ .

Next consider life expectancy for an individual of a certain age. This can be determined from the probability of death during the first year, the second year, the third year, and so on. Consider a man age 90. The probability that the man will die within one year is, from the table, 0.161582. The probability that he will die in the second year (between ages 91 and 92) is the probability that he does not die in the first year multiplied by the probability that he does die in the second year. From the numbers in the second column of the table, this is

$$
(1 - 0. 1 6 1 5 8 2) \times 0. 1 7 8 7 9 7 = 0. 1 4 9 9 0 7
$$

Similarly, the probability that he dies in the third year (between ages 92 and 93) is

$$
(1 - 0. 1 6 1 5 8 2) \times (1 - 0. 1 7 8 7 9 7) \times 0. 1 9 7 2 8 7 = 0. 1 3 5 8 3 4
$$

Assuming that death occurs on average halfway through a year, the life expectancy of a man age 90 is

$$
0. 5 \times 0. 1 6 1 5 8 2 + 1. 5 \times 0. 1 4 9 9 0 7 + 2. 5 \times 0. 1 3 5 8 3 4 + \dots
$$

# Example 3.1

Assume that interest rates for all maturities are 4\% per annum (with semiannual compounding) and premiums are paid once a year at the beginning of the year. What is an insurance company's break-even premium for $100,000 of term life insurance for a man of average health age 90? If the term insurance lasts one year, the expected payout is 0.161582 × 100,000 or $16,158. Assume that the payout occurs halfway through the year. (This is likely to be approximately true on average.) The break-even premium is $16,158 discounted for six months. This is 16,152/1.02 or $15,841.

Suppose next that the term insurance lasts two years. In this case, the present value of expected payout in the first year is 15,841 as before. The probability that the policy-holder dies during the second year is (1 - 0.161582) \times 0.178797 = 0.149907 so that there is also an expected payout of 0.149907 \times 100,000 or \$14,991 during the second year. Assuming this happens at time 18 months, the present value of the payout is 14,991 / (1.02^3) or \$14,126. The total present value of payouts is 15,841 + 14,126 or \$29,967.

Consider next the premium payments. The first premium is required at time zero, so we are certain that this will be paid. The probability of the second premium payment being made at the beginning of the second year is the probability that the man does not die during the first year. This is  $1 - 0.161582 = 0.838418$ . When the premium is  $X$  dollars per year, the present value of the premium payments is

$$
X + \frac {0 . 8 3 8 4 1 8 X}{(1 . 0 2) ^ {2}} = 1. 8 0 5 8 6 1 X
$$

The break-even annual premium is given by the value of  $X$  that equates the present value of the expected premium payments to the present value of the expected payout. This is the value of  $X$  that solves

$$
1. 8 0 5 8 6 1 X = 2 9, 9 6 7
$$ or  $X = 16,594$ . The break-even premium payment is therefore 16,594.


# 3.4 Longevity and Mortality Risk

Longevity risk is the risk that advances in medical sciences and lifestyle changes will lead to people living longer. Increases in longevity adversely affect the profitability of most types of annuity contracts (because the annuity has to be paid for longer), but increase the profitability of most life insurance contracts (because the final payout is either delayed or, in the case of term insurance, less likely to happen). Life expectancy varies from country to country, but has been steadily increasing in most parts of the world. Average life expectancy of a child born in the United States in 2019 is estimated to be about 20 years higher than for a child born in 1929. The statistics in Table 3.1 are based on the death rates observed in 2019 for people of different ages. If people continue to live longer, Table 3.1 understates life expectancies.

Mortality risk is the risk that wars, epidemics such as AIDS, or pandemics such as COVID-19, which started at the end of 2019, will lead to people living not as long as expected. This adversely affects the payouts on most types of life insurance contracts (because the insured amount has to be paid earlier than expected), but should increase the profitability of annuity contracts (because the annuity is not paid out for as long). In calculating the impact of mortality risk, it is important to consider the age groups within the population that are likely to be most affected by a particular event.

To some extent, the longevity and mortality risks in the annuity business of a life insurance company offset those in its regular life insurance contracts. Actuaries must carefully assess the insurance company's net exposure under different scenarios. If the exposure is unacceptable, they may decide to enter into reinsurance contracts for some of the risks. Reinsurance is discussed later in this chapter.

# 3.4.1 Longevity Derivatives

A longevity derivative provides payoffs that are potentially attractive to insurance companies when they are concerned about their longevity exposure on annuity contracts and to pension funds. A typical contract is a longevity bond, also known as a survivor bond, which first traded in the late 1990s. A population group is defined and the coupon on the bond at any given time is defined as being proportional to the number of individuals in the population who are still alive.

Who will sell such bonds to insurance companies and pension funds? The answer is some speculators find the bonds attractive because they have very little systematic risk. (See Section 1.3 for a discussion of systematic risk.) The bond payments depend on how long people live and this is largely uncorrelated with returns from the market.

# 3.5 Property-Casualty Insurance

Property-casualty insurance can be subdivided into property insurance and casualty insurance. Property insurance provides protection against loss of or damage to property (from fire, theft, water damage, etc.). Casualty insurance provides protection against legal liability exposures (from, for example, injuries caused to third parties). Casualty insurance might more accurately be referred to as liability insurance. Sometimes both types of insurance are included in a single policy. For example, a home owner might buy insurance that provides protection against various types of loss such as property damage and theft as well as legal liabilities if others are injured while on the property. Similarly, car insurance typically provides protection against theft of, or damage to, one's own vehicle as well as protection against claims brought by others.

Typically, property-casualty policies are renewed from year to year and the insurance company will change the premium if its assessment of the expected payout changes. (This is different from life insurance, where premiums tend to remain the same for the life of the policy.) Because property-casualty insurance companies get involved in many different types of insurance, there is some natural risk diversification. Also, for some risks, the "law of large numbers" applies. For example, if an insurance company has written policies protecting 250,000 home owners against losses from theft and fire damage, the expected payout can be predicted reasonably accurately. This is because the policies provide protection against a large number of (almost) independent events. (Of course, there are liable to be trends through time in the number of losses and size of losses, and the insurance company should keep track of these trends in determining year-to-year changes in the premiums.)


Property damage arising from natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes give rise to payouts for an insurance company that are much less easy to predict. These are termed catastrophic risks. The problem with them is that the claims made by different policyholders are not independent. Either a hurricane happens in a year and the insurance company has to deal with a large number of claims for hurricane-related damage or there is no hurricane in the year and therefore no claims are made. Most large insurers have models based on geographical, seismographical, and meteorological information to estimate the probabilities of catastrophes and the losses resulting therefrom. This provides a basis for setting premiums, but it does not alter the "all-or-nothing" nature of these risks for insurance companies.

Liability insurance, like catastrophe insurance, gives rise to total payouts that vary from year to year and are difficult to predict. For example, claims arising from asbestos-related damage to workers' health have proved very expensive for insurance companies in the United States. A feature of liability insurance is what is known as long-tail risk. This is the possibility of claims being made several years after the insured period is over. In the case of asbestos, for example, the health risks were not realized until some time after exposure. As a result, the claims, when they were made, were under policies that had been in force several years previously. This creates a complication for actuaries and accountants. They cannot close the books soon after the end of each year and calculate a profit or loss. They must allow for the cost of claims that have not yet been made, but may be made some time in the future.

# 3.5.1 CAT Bonds

The derivatives market has come up with a number of products for hedging catastrophic risk. The most popular is a catastrophe (CAT) bond. This is a bond issued by a subsidiary of an insurance company that pays a higher-than-normal interest rate. In exchange for the extra interest, the holder of the bond agrees to cover payouts on a particular type of catastrophic risk that are in a certain range. Depending on the terms of the CAT bond, the interest or principal (or both) can be used to meet claims.

Suppose an insurance company has a  $70 million exposure to California earthquake losses and wants protection for losses over$ 40 million. The insurance company could issue CAT bonds with a total principal of $30 million. In the event that the insurance company's California earthquake losses exceeded $40 million, bondholders would lose some or all of their principal. As an alternative, the insurance company could cover the same losses by making a much bigger bond issue where only the bondholders' interest is at risk. Yet another alternative is to make three separate bond issues covering losses in the range of $40 to $50 million, $50 to $60 million, and $60 to $70 million, respectively.

CAT bonds typically give a high probability of an above-normal rate of interest and a low probability of a high loss. Why would investors be interested in such instruments? The answer is that the return on CAT bonds, like the longevity bonds considered earlier, has no statistically significant correlations with market returns. CAT bonds are therefore an attractive addition to an investor's portfolio. Their total risk can be completely diversified away in a large portfolio. If a CAT bond's expected return is greater than the risk-free interest rate (and typically it is), it has the potential to improve risk-return trade-offs.

# 3.5.2 Ratios Calculated by Property-Casualty Insurers

Insurance companies calculate a loss ratio for different types of insurance. This is the ratio of payouts made to premiums earned in a year. Loss ratios are typically in the  $60\%$  to  $80\%$  range. Statistics published by A. M. Best show that loss ratios in the United States have tended to increase through time. The expense ratio for an insurance company is the ratio of expenses to premiums earned in a year. The two major sources of expenses are loss adjustment expenses and selling expenses. Loss adjustment expenses are those expenses related to determining the validity of a claim and how much the policyholder should be paid. Selling expenses include the commissions paid to brokers and other expenses concerned with the acquisition of business. Expense ratios in the United States are typically in the  $25\%$  to  $30\%$  range and have tended to decrease through time.

The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. Suppose that for a particular category of policies in a particular year the loss ratio is  $75\%$  and the expense ratio is  $30\%$ . The combined ratio is then  $105\%$ . Sometimes a small dividend is paid to policyholders. Suppose that this is  $1\%$  of premiums. When this is taken into account we obtain what is referred to as the combined ratio after dividends. This is  $106\%$  in our example. This number suggests that the insurance company has lost  $6\%$  before tax on the policies being considered. In fact, this may not be the case. Premiums are generally paid by policyholders at the beginning of a year and payouts on claims are made during the year, or after the end of the year. The insurance company is therefore able to earn interest on the premiums during the time that elapses between the receipt of premiums and payouts. Suppose that, in our example, investment income is  $9\%$  of premiums received. When the investment income is taken into account, a ratio of  $106 - 9 = 97\%$  is obtained. This is referred to as the operating ratio. Table 3.2 summarizes this example.

Table 3.2 Example Showing Calculation of Operating Ratio for a Property-Casualty Insurance Company

<table><tr><td>Loss ratio</td><td>75\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expense ratio</td><td>30\%</td></tr><tr><td>Combined ratio</td><td>105\%</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends</td><td>1\%</td></tr><tr><td>Combined ratio after dividends</td><td>106\%</td></tr><tr><td>Investment income</td><td>(9\%)</td></tr><tr><td>Operating ratio</td><td>97\%</td></tr></table>

# 3.6 Health Insurance

Health insurance has some of the attributes of property-casualty insurance and some of the attributes of life insurance. It is sometimes considered to be a totally separate category of insurance. The extent to which health care is provided by the government varies from country to country. In the United States publicly funded health care has traditionally been limited and health insurance has therefore been an important consideration for most people. Canada is at the other extreme: nearly all health care needs are provided by a publicly funded system. Doctors are not allowed to offer most services privately. The main role of health insurance in Canada is to cover prescription costs and dental care, which are not funded publicly. In most other countries, there is a mixture of public and private health care. The United Kingdom, for example, has a publicly funded health care system, but some individuals buy insurance to have access to a private system that operates side by side with the public system. (The main advantage of private health insurance is a reduction in waiting times for routine elective surgery.)

In 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in an attempt to reform health care in the United States and increase the number of people with medical coverage. The eligibility for Medicaid (a program for low-income individuals) was expanded and subsidies were provided for low- and middle-income families to help them buy insurance. The act prevents health insurers from taking pre-existing medical conditions into account and requires employers to provide coverage to their employees or pay additional taxes. One difference between the United States and many other countries continues to be that health insurance is largely provided by the private rather than the public sector.

In health insurance, as in other forms of insurance, the policyholder makes regular premium payments and payouts are triggered by events. Examples of such events are the policyholder needing an examination by a doctor, the policyholder requiring treatment at a hospital, and the policyholder requiring prescription medication. Typically the premiums increase because of overall increases in the costs of providing health care. However, they usually cannot increase because the health of the policyholder deteriorates. It is interesting to compare health insurance with auto insurance and life insurance in this respect. An auto insurance premium can increase (and usually does) if the policyholder's driving record indicates that expected payouts have increased and if the costs of repairs to automobiles have increased. Life insurance premiums do not increase—even if the policyholder is diagnosed with a health problem that significantly reduces life expectancy. Health insurance premiums are like life insurance premiums in that changes to the insurance company's assessment of the risk of a payout do not lead to an increase in premiums. However, it is like auto insurance in that increases in the overall costs of meeting claims do lead to premium increases.


Of course, when a policy is first issued, an insurance company does its best to determine the risks it is taking on. In the case of life insurance, questions concerning the policyholder's health have to be answered, pre-existing medical conditions have to be declared, and physical examinations may be required. In the case of auto insurance, the policyholder's driving record is investigated. In both of these cases, insurance can be refused. In the case of health insurance, legislation sometimes determines the circumstances under which insurance can be refused. As indicated earlier, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act makes it very difficult for insurance companies in the United States to refuse coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions.

Health insurance is often provided by the group health insurance plans of employers. These plans typically cover the employee and the employee's family. The cost of the health insurance is sometimes split between the employer and employee. The expenses that are covered vary from plan to plan. In the United States, most plans cover basic medical needs such as medical check-ups, physicals, treatments for common disorders, surgery, and hospital stays. Pregnancy costs may or may not be covered. Procedures such as cosmetic surgery are usually not covered.

# 3.7 Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection

We now consider two key risks facing insurance companies: moral hazard and adverse selection.

# 3.7.1 Moral Hazard

Moral hazard is the risk that the existence of insurance will cause the policyholder to behave differently than he or she would without the insurance. This different behavior increases the risks and the expected payouts of the insurance company. Three examples of moral hazard are:

1. A car owner buys insurance to protect against the car being stolen. As a result of the insurance, he or she becomes less likely to lock the car.
2. An individual purchases health insurance. As a result of the existence of the policy, more health care is demanded than previously.
3. As a result of a government-sponsored deposit insurance plan, a bank takes more risks because it knows that it is less likely to lose depositors because of this strategy. (This was discussed in Section 2.3.)

Moral hazard is not a big problem in life insurance. Insurance companies have traditionally dealt with moral hazard in property-casualty and health insurance in a number of ways. Typically there is a deductible. This means that the policyholder is responsible for bearing the first part of any loss. Sometimes there is a co-insurance provision in a policy. The insurance company then pays a predetermined percentage (less than  $100\%$ ) of losses in excess of the deductible. In addition there is nearly always a policy limit (i.e., an upper limit to the payout). The effect of these provisions is to align the interests of the policyholder more closely with those of the insurance company.

# 3.7.2 Adverse Selection

Adverse selection is the phrase used to describe the problems an insurance company has when it cannot distinguish between good and bad risks. It offers the same price to everyone and inadvertently attracts more of the bad risks. If an insurance company is not able to distinguish good drivers from bad drivers and offers the same auto insurance premium to both, it is likely to attract more bad drivers. If it is not able to distinguish healthy from unhealthy people and offers the same life insurance premiums to both, it is likely to attract more unhealthy people.

To lessen the impact of adverse selection, an insurance company tries to find out as much as possible about the policyholder before committing itself. Before offering life insurance, it often requires the policyholder to undergo a physical examination by an approved doctor. Before offering auto insurance to an individual, it will try to obtain as much information as possible about the individual's driving record. In the case of auto insurance, it will continue to collect information on the driver's risk (number of accidents, number of speeding tickets, etc.) and make year-to-year changes to the premium to reflect this.

Adverse selection can never be completely overcome. It is interesting that, in spite of the physical examinations that are required, individuals buying life insurance tend to die earlier than mortality tables would suggest. But individuals who purchase annuities tend to live longer than mortality tables would suggest.

# 3.8 Reinsurance

Reinsurance is an important way in which an insurance company can protect itself against large losses by entering into contracts with another insurance company. For a fee, the second insurance company agrees to be responsible for some of the risks that have been insured by the first company. Reinsurance allows insurance companies to write more policies than they would otherwise be able to. Some of the counterparties in reinsurance contracts are other insurance companies or rich private individuals; others are companies that specialize in reinsurance such as Swiss Re and Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway.

Reinsurance contracts can take a number of forms. Suppose that an insurance company has an exposure of  $100 million to hurricanes in Florida and wants to limit this to$ 50 million. One alternative is to enter into annual reinsurance contracts that cover on a pro rata basis 50\% of its exposure. (The reinsurer would then probably receive 50\% of the premiums.) If hurricane claims in a particular year total $70 million, the costs to the insurance company would be only 0.5 × $70 or $35 million, and the reinsurance company would pay the other $35 million.

Another, more popular alternative, involving lower reinsurance premiums, is to buy a series of reinsurance contracts covering what are known as excess cost layers. The first layer might provide indemnification for losses between  $50 million and$ 60 million, the next layer might cover losses between $60 million and $70 million, and so on. Each reinsurance contract is known as an excess-of-loss reinsurance contract.

# 3.9 Capital Requirements

The balance sheets for life insurance and property-casualty insurance companies are different because the risks taken and the reserves that must be set aside for future payouts are different.

# 3.9.1 Life Insurance Companies

Table 3.3 shows an abbreviated balance sheet for a life insurance company. Most of the life insurance company's investments are in corporate bonds. The insurance company tries to match the maturity of its assets with the maturity of liabilities. However, it takes on credit risk because the default rate on the bonds may be higher than expected.

Unlike a bank, an insurance company has exposure on the liability side of the balance sheet as well as on the asset side. The policy reserves (80\% of assets in this case) are estimates (usually conservative) of actuaries for the present value of payouts on the policies that have been written. The estimates may prove to be low if the holders of life insurance policies die earlier than expected or the holders of annuity contracts live longer than expected. The 10\% equity on the balance sheet includes the original equity contributed and retained earnings and provides a cushion. If payouts are greater than loss reserves by an amount equal to 5\% of assets, equity will decline, but the life insurance company will survive.

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Net Worth</td></tr><tr><td>Investments</td><td>90</td><td>Policy reserves</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Other assets</td><td>10</td><td>Subordinated long-term debt</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity capital</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>100</td><td>Total</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

# 3.9.2 Property-Casualty Insurance Companies

Table 3.4 shows an abbreviated balance sheet for a property-casualty life insurance company. A key difference between Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 is that the equity in Table 3.4 is much higher. This reflects the differences in the risks taken by the two sorts of insurance companies. The payouts for a property-casualty company are much less easy to predict than those for a life insurance company. Who knows when a hurricane will hit Miami or how large payouts will be for the next asbestos-like liability problem? The unearned premiums item on the liability side represents premiums that have been received, but apply to future time periods. If a policyholder pays  $2,500 for house insurance on June 30 of a year, only$ 1,250 has been earned by December 31 of the year. The investments in Table 3.4 consist largely of liquid bonds with shorter maturities than the bonds in Table 3.3.

# 3.10 The Risks Facing Insurance Companies

The most obvious risk for an insurance company is that the policy reserves are not sufficient to meet the claims of policyholders. Although the calculations of actuaries are usually fairly conservative, there is always the chance that payouts much higher than anticipated will be required. Insurance companies also face risks concerned with the performance of their investments. Many of these investments are in corporate bonds. If defaults on corporate bonds are above average, the profitability of the insurance company will suffer. It is important that an insurance company's bond portfolio be diversified by business sector and geographical region. An insurance company also needs to monitor the liquidity risks associated with its investments. Illiquid bonds (e.g., those the insurance company might buy in a private placement) tend to provide higher yields than bonds that are publicly owned and actively traded. However, they cannot be as readily converted into cash to meet unexpectedly high claims. Insurance companies enter into transactions with banks and reinsurance companies. This exposes them to credit risk. Like banks, insurance companies are also exposed to operational risks and business risks.

Regulators specify minimum capital requirements for an insurance company to provide a cushion against losses. Insurance companies, like banks, have also developed their own procedures for calculating economic capital. This is their own internal estimate of required capital (see Chapter 28).

# 3.11 Regulation

The ways in which insurance companies are regulated in the United States and Europe are quite different.

# 3.11.1 United States

In the United States, the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 confirmed that insurance companies are regulated at the state level rather than the federal level. (Banks, by contrast, are regulated at the federal level.) State regulators are concerned with the solvency of insurance companies and their ability to satisfy policyholders' claims. They are also concerned with business conduct (i.e., how premiums are set, advertising, contract terms, the licensing of insurance agents and brokers, and so on).

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is an organization consisting of the chief insurance regulatory officials from all 50 states. It provides a national forum for insurance regulators to discuss common issues and interests. It also provides some services to state regulatory commissions. For example, it provides statistics on the loss ratios of property-casualty insurers. This helps state regulators identify those insurers for which the ratios are outside normal ranges.

Insurance companies are required to file detailed annual financial statements with state regulators, and the state regulators conduct periodic on-site reviews. Capital requirements are determined by regulators using risk-based capital standards determined by NAIC. These capital levels reflect the risk that policy reserves are inadequate, that counterparties in transactions default, and that the return on investments are less than expected.

The policyholder is protected against an insurance company becoming insolvent (and therefore unable to make payouts on claims) by insurance guaranty associations. An insurer is required to be a member of the guaranty association in a state as a condition of being licensed to conduct business in the state. When there is an insolvency by another insurance company operating in the state, each insurance company operating in the state has to contribute an amount to the state guaranty fund that is dependent on the premium income it collects in the state. The fund is used to pay the small policyholders of the insolvent insurance company. (The definition of a small policyholder varies from state to state.) There may be a cap on the amount the insurance company has to contribute to the state guaranty fund in a year. This can lead to the policyholder having to wait several years before the guaranty fund is in a position to make a full payout on its claims. In the case of life insurance, where policies last for many years, the policyholders of insolvent companies are usually taken over by other insurance companies. However, there may be some change to the terms of the policy so that the policyholder is somewhat worse off than before.

The guaranty system for insurance companies in the United States is therefore different from that for banks. In the case of banks, there is a permanent fund created from premiums paid by banks to the FDIC to protect depositors. In the case of insurance companies, there is no permanent fund. Insurance companies have to make contributions after an insolvency has occurred. An exception to this is property-casualty companies in New York State, where a permanent fund does exist.


Regulating insurance companies at the state level is unsatisfactory in some respects. Regulations are not uniform across the different states. A large insurance company that operates throughout the United States has to deal with a large number of different regulatory authorities. Some insurance companies trade derivatives in the same way as banks, but are not subject to the same regulations as banks. This can create problems. In 2008, it transpired that a large insurance company, American International Group (AIG), incurred huge losses trading credit derivatives and had to be bailed out by the federal government.

The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 set up the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), which is housed in the Department of the Treasury. It is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and identifying gaps in regulation. It can recommend to the Financial Stability Oversight Council that a large insurance company (such as AIG) be designated as a nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve. It also liaises with regulators in other parts of the world (particularly, those in the European Union) to foster the convergence of regulatory standards. It may be the case that the United States will eventually move to a federal system for insurance regulation.

# 3.11.2 Europe

In the European Union, insurance companies are regulated centrally. This means that in theory the same regulatory framework applies to insurance companies throughout all member countries. The original framework (established in the 1970s) is known as Solvency I. It was heavily influenced by research carried out by Professor Cornelis Campagne from the Netherlands who showed that, with a capital equal to  $4\%$  of policy provisions, life insurance companies have a  $95\%$  chance of surviving. Investment risks are not explicitly considered by Solvency I.

In 2016, the European Union replaced Solvency I by Solvency II. This assigns capital for a wider range of risks than Solvency II and will be discussed in Chapter 25.

# 3.12 Pension Plans

Pension plans are set up by companies for their employees. Typically, contributions are made to a pension plan by both the employee and the employer while the employee is working. When the employee retires, he or she receives a pension until death. A pension fund therefore involves the creation of a lifetime annuity from regular contributions and has similarities to some of the products offered by life insurance companies. There are two types of pension plans: defined benefit and defined contribution.

In a defined benefit plan, the pension that the employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan. Typically it is calculated by a formula that is based on the number of years of employment and the employee's salary. For example, the pension per year might equal the employee's average earnings per year during the last three years of employment multiplied by the number of years of employment multiplied by  $2\%$ . The employee's spouse may continue to receive a (usually reduced) pension if the employee dies before the spouse. In the event of the employee's death while still employed, a lump sum is often payable to dependents and a monthly income may be payable to a spouse or dependent children. Sometimes pensions are adjusted for inflation. This is known as indexation. For example, the indexation in a defined benefit plan might lead to pensions being increased each year by  $75\%$  of the increase in the consumer price index. Pension plans that are sponsored by governments (such as Social Security in the United States) are similar to defined benefit plans in that they require regular contributions up to a certain age and then provide lifetime pensions.


In a defined contribution plan the employer and employee contributions are invested on behalf of the employee. When employees retire, there are typically a number of options open to them. The amount to which the contributions have grown can be converted to a lifetime annuity. In some cases, the employee can opt to receive a lump sum instead of an annuity.

The key difference between a defined contribution and a defined benefit plan is that, in the former, the funds are identified with individual employees. An account is set up for each employee and the pension is calculated only from the funds contributed to that account. By contrast, in a defined benefit plan, all contributions are pooled and payments to retirees are made out of the pool. In the United States, a  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plan is a form of defined contribution plan where the employee elects to have some portion of his or her income directed to the plan (with possibly some employer matching) and can choose between a number of investment alternatives (e.g., stocks, bonds, and money market instruments).

An important aspect of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans is the deferral of taxes. No taxes are payable on money contributed to the plan by the employee and contributions by a company are deductible. Taxes are payable only when pension income is received (and at this time the employee may have a relatively low marginal tax rate).

Defined contribution plans involve very little risk for employers. If the performance of the plan's investments is less than anticipated, the employee bears the cost. By contrast, defined benefit plans impose significant risks on employers because they are ultimately responsible for paying the promised benefits. Let us suppose that the assets of a defined benefit plan total  $100 million and that actuaries calculate the present value of the obligations to be$ 120 million. The plan is 20 million underfunded and the employer is required to make up the shortfall (usually over a number of years). The risks posed by defined benefit plans have led some companies to convert defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans.

Estimating the present value of the liabilities in defined benefit plans is not easy. An important issue is the discount rate used. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the pension plan liabilities. It used to be common to use the average rate of return on the assets of the pension plan as the discount rate. This encourages the

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 3.2

# A Perfect Storm

During the period from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2002, the S&P 500 declined by about  $40\%$  from 1469.25 to 879.82, and the 20-year Treasury rate in the United States declined by 200 basis points from  $6.83\%$  to  $4.83\%$ . The impact of the first of these events was that the market value of the assets of defined benefit pension plans declined sharply. The impact of the second of the two events was that the discount rate used by defined benefit plans for their liabilities decreased so that the fair value of the liabilities calculated by actuaries increased. This created a "perfect storm" for the pension plans. Many funds that had been overfunded became underfunded. Funds that had been slightly underfunded became much more seriously underfunded.

When a company has a defined benefit plan, the value of its equity is adjusted to reflect the amount by which the plan is overfunded or underfunded. It is not surprising that many companies have tried to replace defined benefit pension plans with defined contribution plans to avoid the risk of equity being eroded by a perfect storm.

pension plan to invest in equities because the average return on equities is higher than the average return on bonds, making the value of the liabilities look low. Accounting standards now recognize that the liabilities of pension plans are obligations similar to bonds and require the liabilities of the pension plans of private companies to be discounted at AA-rated bond yields. The difference between the value of the assets of a defined benefit plan and that of its liabilities must be recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet of the company. Thus, if a company's defined benefit plan is underfunded, the company's shareholder equity is reduced. A perfect storm is created when the assets of a defined benefit pension plan decline sharply in value and the discount rate for its liabilities decreases sharply (see Business Snapshot 3.2).

# 3.12.1 Are Defined Benefit Plans Viable?

A typical defined benefit plan provides the employee with about  $70\%$  of final salary as a pension and includes some indexation for inflation. What percentage of the employee's income during his or her working life should be set aside for providing the pension? The answer depends on assumptions about interest rates, how fast the employee's income rises during the employee's working life, and so on. But, if an insurance company were asked to provide a quote for the sort of defined benefit plan we are considering, the required contribution rate would be about  $25\%$  of income each year. (Problems 3.15 and 3.19 provide an indication of calculations that can be carried out.) The insurance company would invest the premiums in corporate bonds (in the same way that it does the premiums for life insurance and annuity contracts) because this provides the best way of matching the investment income with the payouts.


The contributions to defined benefit plans (employer plus employee) are much less than  $25\%$  of income. In a typical defined benefit plan, the employer and employee each contribute around  $5\%$ . The total contribution is therefore only  $40\%$  of what an insurance actuary would calculate the required premium to be. It is therefore not surprising that many defined pension plans are underfunded.

Unlike insurance companies, pension funds choose to invest a significant proportion of their assets in equities. (A typical portfolio mix for a pension plan is  $60\%$  equity and  $40\%$  debt.) By investing in equities, the pension fund is creating a situation where there is some chance that the pension plan will be fully funded. But there is also some chance of severe underfunding. If equity markets do well, as they have done from 1960 to 2020 in many parts of the world, defined benefit plans may find they can afford their liabilities. But if equity markets perform badly, there are likely to be problems.

This raises an interesting question: Who is responsible for underfunding in defined benefit plans? In the first instance, it is the company's shareholders who bear the cost. If the company declares bankruptcy, the cost may be borne by the government via insurance that is offered.[2] In either case there is a transfer of wealth to retirees from the next generation.

Many people argue that wealth transfers from one generation to another are not acceptable. A  $25\%$  contribution rate to pension plans is probably not feasible. If defined benefit plans are to continue, there must be modifications to the terms of the plans so that there is some risk sharing between retirees and the next generation. If equity markets perform badly during their working life, retirees must be prepared to accept a lower pension and receive only modest help from the next generation. If equity markets perform well, retirees can receive a full pension and some of the benefits can be passed on to the next generation.

Longevity risk is a major concern for pension plans. We mentioned earlier that life expectancy increased by about 20 years between 1929 and 2019. If this trend continues, the underfunding problems of defined benefit plans (both those administered by companies and those administered by national governments) may become more severe. It is not surprising that, in many jurisdictions, individuals have the right to work past the normal retirement age. Depending on the rules governing pensions in a particular jurisdiction, this can help solve the problems faced by defined benefit pension plans. An individual who retires at 70 rather than 65 makes an extra five years of pension contributions and the period of time for which the pension is received is shorter by five years.

# Summary

There are two main types of insurance companies: life and property-casualty. Life insurance companies offer a number of products that provide a payoff when the policyholder dies. Term life insurance provides a payoff only if the policyholder dies during a certain period. Whole life insurance provides a payoff on the death of the insured, regardless of when this is. There is a savings element to whole life insurance. Typically, the portion of the premium not required to meet expected payouts in the early years of the policy is invested, and this is used to finance expected payouts in later years. Whole life insurance policies usually give rise to tax benefits, because the present value of the tax paid is less than it would be if the investor had chosen to invest funds directly rather than through the insurance policy, and in some jurisdictions is zero.

Life insurance companies also offer annuity contracts. These are contracts that, in return for a lump-sum payment, provide the policyholder with an annual income from a certain date for the rest of his or her life. Mortality tables provide important information for the valuation of the life insurance contracts and annuities. However, actuaries must consider (a) longevity risk (the possibility that people will live longer than expected) and (b) mortality risk (the possibility that epidemics such as COVID-19 will reduce life expectancy for some segments of the population).

Property-casualty insurance is concerned with providing protection against a loss of, or damage to, property. It also protects individuals and companies from legal liabilities. The most difficult payouts to predict are those where the same event is liable to trigger claims by many policyholders at about the same time. Examples of such events are hurricanes or earthquakes.

Health insurance has some of the features of life insurance and some of the features of property-casualty insurance. Health insurance premiums are like life insurance premiums in that changes to the company's assessment of the risk of payouts do not lead to an increase in premiums. However, it is like property-casualty insurance in that increases in the overall costs of providing health care can lead to increases in premiums.

Two key risks in insurance are moral hazard and adverse selection. Moral hazard is the risk that the behavior of an individual or corporation with an insurance contract will be different from the behavior without the insurance contract. Adverse selection is the risk that the individuals and companies who buy a certain type of policy are those for which expected payouts are relatively high. Insurance companies take steps to reduce these two types of risk, but they cannot eliminate them altogether.

Insurance companies are different from banks in that their liabilities as well as their assets are subject to risk. A property-casualty insurance company must typically keep more equity capital, as a percent of total assets, than a life insurance company. In the United States, insurance companies are different from banks in that they are regulated at the state level rather than at the federal level. In Europe, insurance companies are regulated by the European Union and by national governments. The European Union has developed a new set of capital requirements, known as Solvency II.

There are two types of pension plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans are straightforward. Contributions made by an employee and contributions made by the company on behalf of the employee are kept in a separate account, invested on behalf of the employee, and converted into a lifetime annuity when the employee retires. In a defined benefit plan, contributions from all employees and the company are pooled and invested. Retirees receive a pension that is based on the salary they earned while working. The viability of defined benefit plans is questionable. Many are underfunded and need superior returns from equity markets to pay promised pensions to both current and future retirees.

# Further Questions

3.16 Use Table 3.1 to calculate the minimum premium an insurance company should charge for a 5 million three-year term life insurance contract issued to a man age 60. Assume that the premium is paid at the beginning of each year and death always takes place halfway through a year. The risk-free interest rate is 6\% per annum (with semiannual compounding).
3.17 An insurance company's losses of a particular type per year are to a reasonable approximation normally distributed with a mean of $150 million and a standard deviation of $50 million. (Assume that the risks taken by the insurance company are entirely nonsystematic.) The one-year risk-free rate is 5\% per annum with annual compounding. Estimate the cost of the following:

(a) A contract that will pay in one-year's time  $60\%$  of the insurance company's costs on a pro rata basis.
 (b) A contract that pays $100 million in one-year's time if losses exceed $200 million.

3.18 During a certain year, interest rates fall by 200 basis points (2\%) and equity prices are flat. Discuss the effect of this on a defined benefit pension plan that is  $60\%$  invested in equities and  $40\%$  invested in bonds.

3.19 Suppose that in a certain defined benefit pension plan

(a) Employees work for 45 years earning wages that increase at a real rate of  $2\%$ .
(b) They retire with a pension equal to  $70\%$  of their final salary. This pension increases at the rate of inflation minus  $1\%$ .
(c) The pension is received for 18 years.
(d) The pension fund's income is invested in bonds that earn the inflation rate plus  $1.5\%$ .

Estimate the percentage of an employee's salary that must be contributed to the pension plan if it is to remain solvent. (Hint: Do all calculations in real rather than nominal dollars.)
