# Financial Instruments

Financial institutions do a huge volume of trading in a wide range of different financial instruments. There are a number of reasons for this. Some trades are designed to satisfy the needs of their clients, some are to manage their own risks, some are to exploit arbitrage opportunities, and some are to reflect their own views on the direction in which market prices will move. (The Volcker rule in the Dodd-Frank Act, which will be discussed in Chapter 26, restricts the extent to which banks can engage in speculative trading.)

In this chapter, we discuss different financial instruments and how they trade. There are two main markets for trading financial instruments. These are the exchange-traded market and the over-the-counter (or OTC) market. The OTC market is discussed in the next chapter. At this stage we note that exchanges define the contracts that can be traded and organize trading to ensure that contracts are honored. The OTC market links traders who work for financial institutions, large corporations, and fund managers. Trades are typically much larger than those on an exchange and the terms of a trade do not have to be those specified by exchanges.

# 5.1 Long and Short Positions in Assets

The simplest type of trade is the purchase of an asset for cash or the sale of an asset that is owned for cash. Examples of such trades are:

The purchase of 100 IBM shares

- The sale of 1 million British pounds for U.S. dollars
- The purchase of 1,000 ounces of gold
- The sale of 1 million worth of bonds issued by General Motors

The first of these trades would typically be done on an exchange; the other three would be done in the OTC market. The trades are sometimes referred to as spot trades because they lead to almost immediate (on the spot) delivery of the asset.

When using a broker to purchase an asset on an exchange, a trader can often borrow part of the cost of the asset from the broker, pledging the asset as collateral. This is known as buying on margin. The broker's risk is that the price of the asset will decline sharply. Accordingly, the broker monitors the margin account balance. This is the part of the purchase price paid by the investor adjusted for gains or losses on the asset. If the balance in the margin account falls below a certain level, known as the maintenance margin, the trader is required to bring the balance back up to that level. Suppose a trader buys 1,000 shares at \$120 per share on margin. Suppose further the amount borrowed is 50\% of the price of the asset and the maintenance margin is 25\% of the price of the asset. The trader will have to provide half the cost or \$60,000. If the share price falls to \$78, there is a \$42,000 loss and the balance in the margin account becomes \$18,000. This is 18,000/78,000 or 23.1\% of the value of the asset, and the trader will have to provide \$1,500 of cash to bring the balance in the margin account up to 25\% of 78,000. If the trader fails to do this, the broker sells the position. This example corresponds to the limits of what is allowed in the United States. Regulations allow an investor to finance up to 50\% of the price by buying on margin. The minimum maintenance margin is 25\% of the price of the asset.

# 5.1.1 Short Sales

In some markets, it is possible to sell an asset that you do not own with the intention of buying it back later. This is referred to as shorting the asset. We will illustrate how it works by considering the shorting of shares of a stock.

Suppose an investor instructs a broker to short 500 shares of a stock that is traded on an exchange. The broker will carry out the instructions by borrowing the shares from another client and selling them on an exchange in the usual way. (A small fee may be charged for the borrowed shares.) The investor can maintain the short position for as long as desired, provided there are always shares available for the broker to borrow. At some stage, however, the investor will close out the position by purchasing 500 shares. These are then replaced in the account of the client from whom the shares were borrowed. The investor takes a profit if the stock price has declined and a loss if it has risen. If, at any time while the contract is open, the broker is unable to borrow shares, the investor is short-squeezed and is forced to close out the position immediately, even if not ready to do so.

An investor with a short position must pay to the broker any income, such as dividends or interest, that would normally be received on the asset that has been shorted. The

Table 5.1 Cash Flows from Short Sale and Purchase of Shares

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Purchase of Shares</td></tr><tr><td>April:</td><td>Purchase 500 shares for \$120</td></tr><tr><td>May:</td><td>Receive dividend</td></tr><tr><td>July:</td><td>Sell 500 shares for \$100 per share</td></tr><tr><td>Net Profit = -9,500</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Short Sale of Shares</td></tr><tr><td>April:</td><td>Borrow 500 shares and sell them for \$120</td></tr><tr><td>May:</td><td>Pay dividend</td></tr><tr><td>July:</td><td>Buy 500 shares for \$100 per share</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Replace borrowed shares to close short position</td></tr><tr><td>Net Profit = +9,500</td><td></td></tr></table> broker will transfer this to the client account from which the asset was borrowed. Suppose a trader shorts 500 shares in April when the price per share is  \$120 and closes out the position by buying them back in July when the price per share is\$ 100. Suppose further that a dividend of \$1 per share is paid in May. The investor receives 500 × $120 = $60,000 in April when the short position is initiated. The dividend leads to a payment by the investor of 500 × $1 = $500 in May. The investor also pays 500 × \$100 = 50,000 for shares when the position is closed out in July. The net gain is, therefore,

$$
\$ 60,000 - \$ 500 - \$ 50,000 = \$ 9,500
$$

Table 5.1 illustrates this example and shows that (assuming no fee is charged for borrowing the shares) the cash flows from the short sale are the mirror image of the cash flows from purchasing the shares in April and selling them in July.

An investor entering into a short position has potential future liabilities and is therefore required to provide margin (i.e., collateral). In the United States, the margin is typically  $150\%$  of the value of the shares shorted. The proceeds of the sale typically form part of the margin account, so an extra  $50\%$  of the value of the shares must be provided.

Suppose that 100 shares are shorted at \$60. The margin required is 150\% of the value of the shares or \$9,000. The proceeds of the sale provide \$6,000, so the trader must provide an extra \$3,000. Suppose that a maintenance margin of 125\% is set, so that when the balance in the margin account falls below 125\% of the value of the shares there is a margin call requiring that the balance be brought up to this level. If the share price rises to \$80, 125\% of the value of the shares shorted is \$10,000, and an extra 1,000 of margin would be required. The short trader must provide this to avoid having the short position closed out.

From time to time, regulations are changed on short selling. Prior to 2007, an uptick rule existed in the United States. This meant that stocks could only be shorted when the most recent price movement had been up. The rule was designed to stop short sellers driving down prices. In 2010, after the financial crisis of 2008, an alternative uptick rule was introduced. This states that the uptick rule applies in circumstances where there has been a decline of more than  $10\%$  in the price of a stock in one day. The rule applies for the rest of that day and the next one. Occasionally, there are temporary bans on short selling. For example, on September 19, 2008, in an attempt to halt the slide in bank stock prices, the SEC imposed a temporary ban on the short selling of 799 financial companies. This was similar to a ban imposed by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) the day before.

# 5.2 Derivatives Markets

A derivative is an instrument whose value depends on (or derives from) other more basic market variables. A stock option, for example, is a derivative whose value is dependent on the price of a stock.

Derivatives trade in both the exchange-traded and OTC markets. Both markets are huge. Although the statistics that are collected for the two markets are not exactly comparable, it is clear that the over-the-counter derivatives market is much larger than the exchange-traded derivatives market. The Bank for International Settlements (www.bis.org) collects statistics on the markets. Figure 5.1 compares (a) the estimated total principal amounts underlying transactions that were outstanding in the over-the-counter markets between June 1998 and December 2021 and (b) the estimated total value of the assets underlying exchange-traded contracts during the same period. Using these measures, in December 2021, the size of the over-the-counter market was  \ {598.4}  trillion and the size of the exchange-traded market was  \$ {80.09}  trillion. Figure 5.1 shows that the OTC market grew rapidly until 2007, but has seen little net growth since then. The decline of the market in 2014 and 2015 was largely a result of compression. This is a procedure where two or more counterparties restructure transactions with each other with the result that the underlying principal is reduced.

Figure 5.1 Size of Over-the-Counter and Exchange-Traded Derivatives Markets between 1998 and 2021

In interpreting these numbers, we should bear in mind that the principal (or value of assets) underlying a derivatives transaction is not the same as its value. An example of an over-the-counter contract could be an agreement entered into some time ago to buy 100 million U.S. dollars with British pounds at a predetermined exchange rate in one year. The total principal amount underlying this transaction is  \$100 million. However, the value of the contract might be only\$ 1 million. The Bank for International Settlements estimated the gross market value of all OTC contracts outstanding in December 2021 to be about 12.4 trillion.

# 5.3 Plain Vanilla Derivatives

This section discusses the standard, or commonly traded, contracts in derivatives markets: forwards, futures, swaps, and options. They are sometimes referred to as plain vanilla products.

# 5.3.1 Forward Contracts

A forward contract is an agreement to buy an asset in the future for a certain price. Forward contracts trade in the over-the-counter market. One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

Forward contracts on foreign exchange are very popular. Table 5.2 provides quotes on the exchange rate between the British pound (GBP) and the U.S. dollar (USD) that might be provided by a large international bank in April 2022. The quotes are for the number of USD per GBP. The first row indicates that the bank is prepared to buy GBP (also known as sterling) in the spot market (i.e., for virtually immediate delivery) at the rate of  \$1.2732 per GBP and sell sterling in the spot market at\$ 1.2736 per GBP; the second row indicates that the bank is prepared to buy sterling in one month at \$1.2746 per GBP and sell sterling in one month at \$1.2751 per GBP; and so on.

Table 5.2 Spot and Forward Quotes for the USD/GBP Exchange Rate (GBP = British pound; USD = U.S. dollar; quote is number of USD per GBP)

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bid</td><td>Ask</td></tr><tr><td>Spot</td><td>1.2732</td><td>1.2736</td></tr><tr><td>1-month forward</td><td>1.2746</td><td>1.2751</td></tr><tr><td>3-month forward</td><td>1.2772</td><td>1.2777</td></tr><tr><td>1-year forward</td><td>1.2883</td><td>1.2889</td></tr></table>

Forward contracts can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Suppose that at the time of the quotes, the treasurer of a U.S. corporation knows that the corporation will pay £1 million in one year and wants to hedge against exchange rate moves. The treasurer can agree to buy £1 million one-year forward at an exchange rate of 1.2889 by trading with the bank providing the quotes in Table 5.2. The corporation then has a long forward contract on GBP. It has agreed that in one year it will buy £1 million from the bank for \$1.2889 million. The bank has a short forward contract on GBP. It has agreed that in one year it will sell £1 million for \$1.2889 million. Both the corporation and the bank have made a binding commitment.

What are the possible outcomes in the trade we have just described? The forward contract obligates the corporation to purchase 1 million pounds at an exchange rate of 1.2889 in one year. If the spot exchange rate applicable to the corporation when buying pounds rose to, say, 1.5000, at the end of one year the forward contract leads to 1 million pounds being purchased by the corporation at an exchange rate of 1.2889 rather than at the spot exchange rate of 1.5000. This is worth  $211,100 = (1.5000 - 1.2889) \times \1,000,000$  to the corporation. Of course, it may also happen that the contract will have a negative final value to the corporation. If the exchange rate falls to 1.1000 by the end of the year, the forward contract leads to 1 million pounds being purchased by the corporation at an exchange rate of 1.2889 rather than at the 1.1000 available in the market. This costs the corporation \$188,900 (= (1.2889 - 1.1000) \times \$ 1,000,000). This example shows that a long forward contract can lead to a payoff that is a gain or loss. The payoff is the spot price of the assets underlying the forward contract minus the agreed delivery price for the assets and is shown in Figure 5.2(a).

The bank in our example has entered into a short forward contract. Its position is the mirror image of that of the corporation. The bank has agreed to sell 1 million pounds for an exchange rate of 1.2889 in one year. If the spot exchange rate applicable to the bank rose to 1.5000, at the end of the year the forward contract leads to 1 million pounds being sold by the bank at an exchange rate of 1.2889 rather than at the spot exchange rate of 1.5000. This costs the bank  \$211,100. If the exchange rate falls to 1.1000 by the end of the year, the forward contract leads to 1 million pounds being sold by the bank at an exchange rate of 1.2889 rather than 1.1000. This is worth\$ 188,900 to the bank. The payoff is the agreed delivery price for the assets underlying the forward contract minus the spot price and is shown in Figure 5.2(b). The valuation of forward contracts and the determination of forward prices are discussed in Appendix C.

# 5.3.2 Futures Contracts

Futures contracts, like forward contracts, are agreements to buy an asset at a future time. Unlike forward contracts, futures are traded on an exchange. This means that the contracts that trade are standardized. The exchange defines the amount of the asset underlying one contract, when delivery can be made, exactly what can be delivered, and so on. Contracts are referred to by their delivery month. For example, the September 2024 gold futures is a contract where delivery is made in September 2024. Whereas only one delivery day is usually specified for a forward contract, there is usually a period of time during the delivery month when delivery can take place in a futures contract. Alternative delivery times, delivery locations, and so on, are defined by the exchange. It is nearly always the party with the short position that has the right to initiate the delivery process and choose between the alternatives. As we will explain shortly, futures traders have potential future liabilities and are required to post margin.

Most futures contracts trade actively with the futures price at any given time being determined by supply and demand. If there are more buyers than sellers at a time when the September 2024 future price of gold is 1,280 per ounce, the price goes up. Similarly, if there are more sellers than buyers, the price goes down.

One of the attractive features of exchange-traded contracts such as futures is that it is easy to close out a position. If you buy (i.e., take a long position in) a September 2024 gold futures contract on March 5, 2024, you can exit on June 5, 2024, by selling (i.e., taking a short position in) the same contract. Closing out a position in a forward contract is not as easy as closing out a position in a futures contract. As a result, forward contracts usually lead to final delivery of the underlying assets, whereas futures contracts are usually closed out before the delivery month is reached. Business Snapshot 5.1 is an amusing story showing that the assets underlying futures contracts do get delivered if mistakes are made in the close out.

The futures price of an asset is usually very similar to its forward price. Appendix C at the end of the book gives the relationship between the futures or forward price of an asset and its spot price. One difference between a futures and a forward contract is that a futures is settled daily whereas a forward is settled at the end of its life. For example, if a futures price increases during a day, money flows from traders with short positions to traders with long positions at the end of the day. Similarly, if a futures price decreases during a day, money flows in the opposite direction. Because a futures contract is settled daily whereas a forward contract is settled at the end of its life, the timing of the realization of gains and losses is different for the two contracts. This sometimes causes confusion, as indicated in Business Snapshot 5.2. Table 5.3 summarizes the difference between forward and futures contracts.

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 5.1

# The Unanticipated Delivery of a Futures Contract

This story (which may well be apocryphal) was told to the author of this book many years ago by a senior executive of a financial institution. It concerns a new employee of the financial institution who had not previously worked in the financial sector. One of the clients of the financial institution regularly entered into a long futures contract on live cattle for hedging purposes and issued instructions to close out the position on the last day of trading. (Live cattle futures contracts trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and each contract is on 40,000 pounds of cattle.) The new employee was given responsibility for handling the account.

When the time came to close out a contract, the employee noted that the client was long one contract and instructed a trader at the exchange go long (not short) one contract. The result of this mistake was that the financial institution ended up with a long position in two live cattle futures contracts. By the time the mistake was spotted, trading in the contract had ceased.

The financial institution (not the client) was responsible for the mistake. As a result it started to look into the details of the delivery arrangements for live cattle futures contracts—something it had never done before. Under the terms of the contract, cattle could be delivered by the party with the short position to a number of different locations in the United States during the delivery month. Because it was long, the financial institution could do nothing but wait for a party with a short position to issue a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange and for the exchange to assign that notice to the financial institution.

It eventually received a notice from the exchange and found that it would receive live cattle at a location 2,000 miles away the following Tuesday. The new employee was dispatched to the location to handle things. It turned out that the location had a cattle auction every Tuesday. The party with the short position that was making delivery bought cattle at the auction and then immediately delivered them. Unfortunately, the cattle could not be resold until the next cattle auction the following Tuesday. The employee was therefore faced with the problem of making arrangements for the cattle to be housed and fed for a week. This was a great start to a first job in the financial sector!

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 5.2

# A Software Error?

A foreign exchange trader working for a bank enters into a long forward contract to buy 1 million pounds sterling at an exchange rate of 1.3000 in three months. At the same time, another trader on the next desk takes a long position in 16 three-month futures contracts on sterling. The futures price is 1.3000 and each contract is on 62,500 pounds. The sizes of the positions taken by the forward and futures traders are therefore the same. Within minutes of the positions being taken, the forward and the futures prices both increase to 1.3040. The bank's systems show that the futures trader has made a profit of \$4,000 while the forward trader has made a profit of only \$3,900. The forward trader immediately calls the bank's systems department to complain. Does the forward trader have a valid complaint?

The answer is no! The daily settlement of futures contracts ensures that the futures trader realizes an almost immediate profit corresponding to the increase in the futures price. If the forward trader closed out the position by entering into a short contract at 1.3040, the forward trader would have contracted to buy 1 million pounds at 1.3000 in three months and sell 1 million pounds at 1.3040 in three months. This would lead to a  \$4,000 profit—but in three months, not in one day. The forward trader's profit is the present value of\$ 4,000.

The forward trader can gain some consolation from the fact that gains and losses are treated symmetrically. If the forward/futures prices dropped to 1.2960 instead of rising to 1.3040, the futures trader would take a loss of  \$4,000 while the forward trader would take a loss of only\$ 3,900. Also, over the three-month contract life, the total gain or loss from the futures contract and the forward contract would be the same.

Table 5.3 Comparison of Forward and Futures Contracts

<table><tr><td>Forward</td><td>Futures</td></tr><tr><td>Private contract between two parties</td><td>Traded on an exchange</td></tr><tr><td>Not standardized</td><td>Standardized contract</td></tr><tr><td>Usually one specified delivery date</td><td>Range of delivery dates</td></tr><tr><td>Settled at end of contract</td><td>Settled daily</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery or final cash settlement usually takes place</td><td>Contract is usually closed out prior to maturity</td></tr><tr><td>Some credit risk</td><td>Virtually no credit risk</td></tr></table>

Futures are cleared on an exchange clearing house. The clearing house stands between the two sides and is responsible for ensuring that required payments are made. The clearing house has a number of members. If a trader or broker is not a member of the exchange clearing house, it must arrange to clear trades through a member.

The clearing house requires initial margin and variation margin from its members. The variation margin for a day may be positive or negative and covers the gains and losses during the day. The initial margin is an extra amount held by the exchange that provides protection to the exchange in the event that the member defaults. In addition, the exchange clearing house requires default fund (also known as a guaranty fund) contributions from its members. This provides additional protection to the exchange. If a member defaults and its initial margin and default fund contributions are not enough to cover losses, the default fund contributions of other members can be used.

Exchange clearing house members require margin from brokers and other traders when they agree to clear their trades and brokers require margin from their clients. Typically the relationship between broker and client involves the posting of initial margin (greater than the initial margin applicable to a member). When the balance in the client's margin account (adjusted for daily gains and losses) falls below a maintenance margin level, the client is required to bring the balance back up to the initial margin level.

# 5.3.3 LIBOR and Its Replacements

Before moving on to discuss swaps and other derivatives, it is appropriate to discuss LIBOR (short for London Interbank Offered Rate). LIBOR rates were for 40 years compiled by asking a panel of global banks to provide quotes estimating the unsecured rates of interest at which they could borrow from other banks just prior to 11 A.M. (U.K. time). Five different currencies (the U.K. pound sterling, Swiss franc, euro, Japanese yen, and U.S. dollar) and several different borrowing periods (overnight, one week, one month, two months, three months, six months, and one year) were considered. The banks submitting quotes typically had good (AA) credit ratings. LIBOR rates were therefore considered to be estimates of unsecured borrowing rates for creditworthy banks.

LIBOR rates served as key reference rates for hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions involving floating interest rates throughout the world. For example, the borrowing rate on a five-year loan in a particular situation might be specified as three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points (i.e., three-month LIBOR plus  $0.3\%$ ). The value of three-month LIBOR would then be noted at the beginning of each three-month period and interest based on this LIBOR rate would be paid by the borrower at the end of the period.

A problem with LIBOR was that there was not enough borrowing between banks for a bank's estimates to be based on market transactions. As a result, LIBOR submissions by banks involved a certain amount of judgment, and some banks were found guilty of manipulating their LIBOR quotes to increase their profits or for other reasons. As a result, bank regulators insisted that the market move away from LIBOR to reference rates based on actual market transactions. In 2021, LIBOR was phased out as a reference rate for new transactions, although USD LIBOR continued to be quoted until mid-2023 for some maturities.

The regulators' plan was to base reference rates on overnight rates, which do trade actively. In the United States, the rate chosen was the secured overnight funding rate, SOFR; in the U.K., it was the sterling overnight index average, SONIA; in the eurozone, it was the euro short-term rate, ESTER; in Switzerland, it was the Swiss average rate overnight, SARON; in Japan, it was the Tokyo average overnight rate, TONAR.

Longer rates such as three-month rates, six-month rates, or one-year rates can be determined from overnight rates by compounding them daily. However there are two key differences between the use of LIBOR and the use of overnight rates for defining floating rates:

- LIBOR is known at the beginning of the period to which it applies. A rate calculated by compounding overnight rates is known only at the end of the period to which it applies. A borrower who agrees to pay three-month SOFR plus 50 basis points will therefore not know the rate for a particular three-month period until the end of that period.
- LIBOR incorporates some credit risk. The replacement overnight rates and the longer-term rates calculated from them are generally assumed to be risk-free rates. Indeed, they are referred to as RFRs (short for risk-free rates)

Other reference rates, which are similar to LIBOR but based on actual transactions have been suggested. These include the Bloomberg Short-Term Yield Index (BSBY), which estimates the average yield at which large banks access unsecured funds and AMERIBOR, created by the American Financial Exchange, which reflects the actual borrowing costs of thousands of community and regional banks in the United States. It remains to be seen whether these become more popular than the overnight rates favored by regulators.

# 5.3.4 Swaps

The first swap contracts were negotiated in the early 1980s. Since then, the market has seen phenomenal growth. Swaps now occupy a position of central importance in the over-the-counter derivatives market.

A swap is an agreement between two companies to exchange cash flows in the future. The agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in which they are to be calculated. Generally, the calculation of the cash flows involves the future values of interest rates, exchange rates, or other market variables.

A forward contract can be viewed as a simple example of a swap. Suppose it is March 1, 2024, and a company enters into a forward contract to buy 100 ounces of gold for \$1,300 per ounce in one year. The company can sell the gold in one year as soon as it is received. The forward contract is therefore equivalent to a swap where the company agrees that on March 1, 2025, it will swap 100 times the spot price of gold for \$130,000.

Whereas a forward contract is equivalent to the exchange of cash flows on just one future date, swaps typically lead to cash flow exchanges taking place on several future dates. The most common swap is a "plain vanilla" interest rate swap where a fixed rate of interest is exchanged for a floating reference rate. Both interest rates are applied to the same notional principal. (The principal is "notional" because it is used only for the determination of interest exchanges. The principal itself is not exchanged.) A swap where Company A pays a fixed rate of interest of 3\% and receives SOFR, with payments being exchanged every six months, is shown in Figure 5.3. (As explained earlier SOFR is an overnight rate in the United States. The six month rate is calculated by compounding daily rates and is not known at the end of the period to which it applies.) Suppose that in this contract the notional principal is 100 million, and the swap lasts for three years. Table 5.4 shows the cash flows to Company A for one possible set of future interest rates. The swap is entered into on March 3, 2024. The SOFR floating interest rate for the first six months (known at the end of the six months) is assumed to be 2.2\% per year or 1.1\% per six months. (Note that all rates in Table 5.4 are assumed to be semiannually compounded.) As a result, the floating-rate cash flow received on September 3, 2024, is 0.011 \times 100 or \$1.1 million. Similarly, SOFR for the second six months (known on

Cash flows do not take account of day count conventions, holiday calendars, and so on. Interest rates are semiannually compounded.

March 3, 2025) is assumed to be 2.8\% per annum (or 1.4\% per six months). This leads to a floating-rate cash flow of \$1.4 million; and so on. The fixed-rate cash flow paid is always \$1.5 million (3\% of 100 million applied to a six-month period).

Plain vanilla interest rate swaps are very popular because they can be used for many purposes. For example, the swap in Figure 5.3 could be used by Company A to transform borrowings at a floating rate of SOFR plus  $1\%$  to borrowings at a fixed rate of  $4\%$ . The combination of

1. Pay interest at SOFR plus  $1\%$  under loan agreement;
2. Receive SOFR under swap agreement; and
3. Pay  $3\%$  under the swap agreement nets out to a fixed payment of  $4\%$ . It can also be used by Company A to transform an investment earning a fixed rate of  $2.5\%$  to an investment earning SOFR minus  $0.5\%$ . The combination of
4. Receive  $2.5\%$  on the investment;
5. Receive SOFR under swap agreement; and
6. Pay  $3\%$  under the swap agreement nets out to a floating income at the rate of SOFR minus  $0.5\%$ .

# Example 5.1

Suppose a bank has floating-rate deposits and five-year fixed-rate loans. As will be discussed in Chapter 14, this exposes the bank to significant risks. If rates rise, the deposits will be rolled over at high rates and the bank's net interest income will contract. The bank can hedge its risks by entering into the interest rate swap in Figure 5.3 (taking the role of Company A). The swap can be viewed as transforming the floating-rate deposits to fixed-rate deposits. Alternatively, it can be viewed as transforming the fixed-rate loans to floating-rate loans.

Table 5.5 shows quotes for U.S. dollar swaps that might be posted by the derivatives dealer in Figure 5.3. The first row shows that the bank is prepared to enter into a two-year swap where it pays a fixed rate of  $2.55\%$  and receives SOFR. It is also prepared to enter into a swap where it receives  $2.58\%$  and pays SOFR. The bid-ask spread in Table 5.5 is 3 or 4 basis points. The average of the bid and asked fixed rates is known as the swap rate. This is shown in the final column of the table.

The valuation of plain vanilla interest rate swaps is discussed in Appendix D at the end of this book.

# 5.3.5 Options

Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. There are two basic types of option. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. The price in the contract is known as the exercise price or strike price; the date in the contract is known as the expiration date or maturity date. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date. European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. In the exchange-traded equity option market, one contract is usually an agreement to buy or sell 100 shares. European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.

An at-the-money option is an option where the strike price equals the price of the underlying asset. An out-of-the-money option is a call option where the strike price is above the price of the underlying asset or a put option where the strike price is below this price. An in-the-money option is a call option where the strike price is below the price of the underlying asset or a put option where the strike price is above this price.

It should be emphasized that an option gives the holder the right to do something. The holder does not have to exercise this right. By contrast, in a forward and futures contract, the holder is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset. Note that whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a cost to acquiring an option. This cost is referred to as the option premium.

The largest exchange in the world for trading stock options is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com). Table 5.6 gives the mid-market prices of some of the American options trading on Intel (ticket INTC) at a particular time on January 24, 2022. The option strike prices are  $45,$ 47.5, $50, $52.5, \$55, and \$57.5.

The maturities are March 2022, May 2022, and July 2022. The March options have an expiration date of March 18, 2022; the May options have an expiration date of May 20, 2022; and the July options have an expiration date of July 15, 2022. Intel's stock price was 51.98

Suppose an investor instructs a broker to buy one May call option contract on Intel with a strike price of \$52.50. The broker will relay these instructions to a trader at the CBOE. This trader will then find another trader who wants to sell one October call contract on Intel with a strike price of \$52.50, and a price will be agreed upon. We assume that the price is \$3.77, as indicated in Table 5.6. This is the price for an option to buy one share. In the United States, one stock option contract is a contract to buy or sell 100 shares. Therefore, the investor must arrange for \$377 to be remitted to the exchange through the broker. The exchange will then arrange for this amount to be passed on to the party on the other side of the transaction.

In our example, the investor has obtained at a cost of \$377 the right to buy 100 Intel shares for \$52.50 each. The party on the other side of the transaction has received \$377 and has agreed to sell 100 Intel shares for \$3.77 per share if the investor chooses to exercise the option. If the price of Intel does not rise above \$52.50 before May 20, 2022, the option is not exercised and the investor loses \$377. But if the Intel share price does well and the option is exercised when it is \$60, the investor is able to buy 100 shares at \$52.50 per share when they are worth \$60 per share. This leads to a gain of \$750, or 373 when the initial cost of the options is taken into account.

If the investor is bearish on Intel, an alternative trade could be the purchase of one July put option contract with a strike price of \$50. From Table 5.6, we see that this would cost 100 × \$4.15 or \$415. The investor would obtain at a cost of \$415 the right to sell 100 Intel shares for \$50 per share prior to July 15, 2022. If the Intel share stays above \$50, the option is not exercised and the investor loses \$415. But if the investor is able to exercise when the stock price is \$40, the investor makes a gain of \$1,000 by buying 100 Intel shares at \$40 and selling them for \$50. The net profit after the cost of the options is taken into account is \$585.

The options trading on the CBOE are American. If we assume for simplicity that they are European so that they can be exercised only at maturity, the investor's profit as a function of the final stock price for the Intel options we have been considering is shown in Figure 5.4.

There are four types of trades in options markets:

1. Buying a call
2. Selling a call
3. Buying a put
4. Selling a put

Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short positions. Selling an option is also known as writing an option.

When a trader purchases options for cash, there are no margin requirements because there are no circumstances under which the trade becomes a liability for the trader in the future. Options on stocks and stock indices that last longer than nine months can be bought on margin in the United States. The margin account works similarly to that for stocks except that  $25\%$  rather than  $50\%$  of the initial price can be borrowed.

When options are sold (i.e., written), there are potential future liabilities and margin must be posted. When a call option on a stock has been written, the initial and maintenance margin in the United States is the greater of

1. $100\%$  of the value of the option plus  $20\%$  of the underlying share price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out-of-the-money.
2. $100\%$  of the value of the option plus  $10\%$  of the share price.

When a put option is written, it is the greater of

1. $100\%$  of the value of the option plus  $20\%$  of the underlying share price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out-of-the-money.
2. $100\%$  of the value of the option plus  $10\%$  of the exercise price.

These margin requirements may be reduced if the trader has other positions in the stock. For example, if the trader has a fully covered position (where the trader has sold call options on a certain number of shares and owns the same number of shares), there is no margin requirement on the short option position.

Options trade very actively in the over-the-counter market as well as on exchanges. The underlying assets include stocks, currencies, and stock indices. Indeed, the over-the-counter market for options is now larger than the exchange-traded market. Whereas exchange-traded options tend to be American, options trading in the over-the-counter market are frequently European. The advantage of the over-the-counter market is that maturity dates, strike prices, and contract sizes can be tailored to meet the precise needs of a client. They do not have to correspond to those specified by the exchange. The sizes of option trades in the over-the-counter are usually much greater than those on exchanges.

Valuation formulas and numerical procedures for options on a variety of assets are in Appendices E and F at the end of this book.

# 5.3.6 Interest Rate Options

Important interest rate options that trade in the over-the-counter market are caps, floors, and swap options (also known as swaptions). Whereas a swap exchanges a sequence of floating rates for a fixed rate, as indicated in Table 5.4, a cap, as its name implies, caps the floating rate. It is a series of call options on a floating rate. If the floating rate is greater than the strike rate (also known as cap rate), there is a payoff equal to the excess of the floating rate over the cap rate, applied to a predetermined notional for the appropriate accrual period; if the floating rate is less than the cap rate, there is no payoff. As in the case of swaps, payoffs are made at the end of the period covered by an interest rate.

A floor is similarly a series of put options on a floating rate. If the floating rate is less than the strike price (floor rate), there is a payoff equal to the difference between the two applied to the notional principal for the appropriate accrual period. Otherwise there is no payoff.

A swap option is an option to enter into a swap at some future time where the fixed rate is the strike rate. There are two types of swap options. One is the option to pay the strike rate and receive the floating rate; the other is the option to pay the floating rate and receive the strike rate. As in the case of a swap and cap or floor, a notional principal is specified.

# 5.4 Non-Traditional Derivatives

Whenever there are risks in the economy, financial engineers have attempted to devise derivatives to allow entities with exposures to manage their risks. Financial institutions typically act as intermediaries and arrange for the risks to be passed on to either (a) entities that have opposite exposures or (b) speculators who are willing to assume the risks. This section gives examples of derivatives that have been developed to meet specific needs.

# 5.4.1 Weather Derivatives

Many companies are in the position where their performance is liable to be adversely affected by the weather. It makes sense for these companies to consider hedging their weather risk in much the same way as they hedge foreign exchange or interest rate risks.

The first over-the-counter weather derivatives were introduced in 1997. To understand how they work, we explain two variables:

HDD: Heating degree days

CDD: Cooling degree days

A day's HDD is defined as

$$
\mathrm {H D D} = \max  (0, 6 5 - A)
$$ and a day's CDD is defined as


$$

\mathrm {C D D} = \max  (0, A - 6 5)

$$ where  $A$  is the average of the highest and lowest temperature during the day at a specified weather station, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. For example, if the maximum temperature during a day (midnight to midnight) is  $68^{\circ}$  Fahrenheit and the minimum temperature is  $44^{\circ}$  Fahrenheit,  $A = 56$ . The daily HDD is then 9 and the daily CDD is 0.

A typical over-the-counter product is a forward or option contract providing a payoff dependent on the cumulative HDD or CDD during a month (that is, the total of the HDDs or CDDs for every day in the month). For example, a dealer could, in January 2024, sell a client a call option on the cumulative HDD during February 2025 at the Chicago O'Hare Airport weather station, with a strike price of 700 and a payment rate of  \$10,000 per degree day. If the actual cumulative HDD is 820, the payoff is$ 10,000 × (820 - 700) = $1.2 million. Often contracts include a payment cap. If the cap in our example is \$1.5 million, the client's position is equivalent to a long call option on cumulative HDD with a strike price of 700 and a short call option on cumulative HDD with a strike price of 850.

A day's HDD is a measure of the volume of energy required for heating during the day. A day's CDD is a measure of the volume of energy required for cooling during the day. Most weather derivatives contracts are entered into by energy producers and energy consumers. But retailers, supermarket chains, food and drink manufacturers, health service companies, agriculture companies, and companies in the leisure industry are also potential users of weather derivatives. The Weather Risk Management Association (www.wrma.org) has been formed to serve the interests of the weather risk management industry.

In September 1999, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading weather futures and European options on weather futures. The contracts are on the cumulative HDD and CDD for a month observed at a weather station. The contracts are settled in cash just after the end of the month once the HDD and CDD are known. One futures contract is 20 times the cumulative HDD or CDD for the month. The CME now offers weather futures and options for many cities throughout the world. It also offers futures and options on hurricanes, frost, and snowfall.

# 5.4.2 Oil Derivatives

Crude oil is one of the most important commodities in the world. Ten-year fixed-price supply contracts have been commonplace in the over-the-counter market for many years. These are swaps where oil at a fixed price is exchanged for oil at a floating price.

There are many grades of crude oil, reflecting variations in gravity and sulfur content. Two important benchmarks for pricing are Brent crude oil (which is sourced from the North Sea) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Crude oil is refined into products such as gasoline, heating oil, fuel oil, and kerosene.

In the over-the-counter market, virtually any derivative that is available on common stocks or stock indices is now available with oil as the underlying asset. Swaps, forward contracts, and options are popular. Contracts sometimes require settlement in cash and sometimes require settlement by physical delivery (i.e., by delivery of the oil).

Exchange-traded contracts on oil are also popular. The CME Group and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) trade a number of oil futures and futures options contracts. Some of the futures contracts are settled in cash; others are settled by physical delivery. For example, the Brent crude oil futures traded on ICE have a cash settlement option; the WTI oil futures traded by the CME Group require physical delivery. In both cases, the amount of oil underlying one contract is 1,000 barrels. The CME Group also trades popular contracts on two refined products: heating oil and gasoline. In both cases, one contract is for the delivery of 42,000 gallons.

# 5.4.3 Natural Gas Derivatives

The natural gas industry throughout the world went through a period of deregulation and the elimination of government monopolies in the 1980s and 1990s. The supplier of natural gas is now not necessarily the same company as the producer of the gas. Suppliers are faced with the problem of meeting daily demand.

A typical over-the-counter contract is for the delivery of a specified amount of natural gas at a roughly uniform rate over a one-month period. Forward contracts, options, and swaps are available in the over-the-counter market. The seller of gas is usually responsible for moving the gas through pipelines to the specified location.

The CME Group trades a contract for the delivery of 10,000 million British thermal units of natural gas. The contract, if not closed out, requires physical delivery to be made during the delivery month at a roughly uniform rate to a particular hub in Louisiana. ICE trades a similar contract in London.

Natural gas is a popular source of energy for heating buildings. It is also used to produce electricity, which in turn is used for air-conditioning. As a result, demand for natural gas is seasonal and dependent on the weather.

# 5.4.4 Electricity Derivatives

Electricity is an unusual commodity because it cannot easily be stored. The maximum supply of electricity in a region at any moment is determined by the maximum capacity of all the electricity-producing plants in the region. In the United States there are 140 regions known as control areas. Demand and supply are first matched within a control area, and any excess power is sold to other control areas. It is this excess power that constitutes the wholesale market for electricity. The ability of one control area to sell power to another control area depends on the transmission capacity of the lines between the two areas. Transmission from one area to another involves a transmission cost, charged by the owner of the line, and there are generally some energy transmission losses.

A major use of electricity is for air-conditioning systems. As a result, the demand for electricity, and therefore its price, is much greater in the summer months than in the winter months. The nonstorability of electricity causes occasional very large movements in the spot price. Heat waves have been known to increase the spot price by as much as  $1,000\%$  for short periods of time.

Like natural gas, electricity has been going through a period of deregulation and the elimination of government monopolies. This has been accompanied by the development of an electricity derivatives market. The CME Group now trades a futures contract on the price of electricity, and there is an active over-the-counter market in forward contracts, options, and swaps. A typical contract (exchange-traded or over-the-counter) allows one side to receive a specified number of megawatt hours for a specified price at a specified location during a particular month. In a  $5 \times 8$  contract, power is received for five days a week (Monday to Friday) during the off-peak period (11 P.M. to 7 A.M.) for the specified month. In a  $5 \times 16$  contract, power is received five days a week during the on-peak period (7 A.M. to 11 P.M.) for the specified month. In a  $7 \times 24$  contract, power is received around the clock every day during the month. Option contracts have either daily exercise or monthly exercise. In the case of daily exercise, the option holder can choose on each day of the month (by giving one day's notice) to receive the specified amount of power at the specified strike price. When there is monthly exercise, a single decision on whether to receive power for the whole month at the specified strike price is made at the beginning of the month.

An interesting contract in electricity and natural gas markets is what is known as a swing option or take-and-pay option. In this contract, a minimum and maximum for the amount of power that must be purchased at a certain price by the option holder is specified for each day during a month and for the month in total. The option holder can change (or swing) the rate at which the power is purchased during the month, but usually there is a limit on the total number of changes that can be made.

# 5.5 Exotic Options and Structured Products

Many different types of exotic options and structured products trade in the over-the-counter market. Although the amount of trading in them is small when compared with the trading in the plain vanilla derivatives, they are important to a bank because the profit on trades in exotic options and structured products tends to be much higher than on plain vanilla options or swaps.

Here are a few examples of exotic options:

Asian options: Whereas regular options provide a payoff based on the price of the underlying asset at the time of exercise, Asian options provide a payoff based on the average of the price of the underlying asset over some specified period. An example is an average price call option that provides a payoff in one year equal to  $\max (\overline{S} -K,0)$  where  $\overline{S}$  is the average asset price during the year and  $K$  is the strike price.

Barrier options: These are options that come into existence or disappear when the price of the underlying asset reaches a certain barrier. For example, a knock-out call option with a strike price of  \$30 and a barrier of\$ 20 is a regular European call option that ceases to exist if the asset price falls below 20.

Basket options: These are options to buy or sell a portfolio of assets rather than options on a single asset.

Binary options: These are options that provide a fixed dollar payoff, or a certain amount of the underlying asset, if some condition is satisfied. An example is an option that provides a payoff in one year of  \$1,000 if a stock price is greater than\$ 20.

Compound options: These are options on options. There are four types: a call on a call, a call on a put, a put on a call, and a put on a put. An example of a compound option is a European option to buy a European option on a stock currently worth \$15. The first option expires in one year and has a strike price of \$1. The second option expires in three years and has a strike price of 20.

Lookback options: These are options that provide a payoff based on the maximum or minimum price of the underlying asset over some period. An example is an option that provides a payoff in one year equal to  $S_{T} - S_{\min}$  where  $S_{T}$  is the asset price at the end of the year and  $S_{\min}$  is the minimum asset price during the year.

Exotic options are sometimes more appropriate for hedging than plain vanilla options. As explained in Business Snapshot 5.3, Microsoft has used Asian options on a basket of some of its foreign currency hedging.

Structured products are products created by banks to meet the needs of investors or corporate treasurers. One example of a structured product is a principal protected note, where a bank offers an investor the opportunity to earn a certain percentage of the return

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 5.3

# Microsoft's Hedging

Microsoft actively manages its foreign exchange exposure. In some countries (e.g., Europe, Japan, and Australia), it bills in the local currency and converts its net revenue to U.S. dollars monthly. For these currencies, there is a clear exposure to exchange rate movements. In other countries (e.g., those in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia), it bills in U.S. dollars. The latter appears to avoid any foreign exchange exposure—but it does not.

Suppose the U.S. dollar strengthens against the currency of a country in which Microsoft is billing in U.S. dollars. People in the country will find Microsoft's products more expensive because it takes more of the local currency to buy 1. As a result, Microsoft is likely to find it necessary to reduce its (U.S. dollar) price in the country or face a decline in sales. Microsoft therefore has a foreign exchange exposure—both when it bills in U.S. dollars and when it bills in the local currency. (This shows that it is important for a company to consider the big picture when assessing its exposure.)

Microsoft sometimes uses options for hedging. Suppose it chooses a one-year time horizon. Microsoft recognizes that its exposure to an exchange rate (say, the Japanese yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate) is an exposure to the average of the exchange rates at the end of each month during the year. This is because approximately the same amount of Japanese yen is converted to U.S. dollars each month. Asian options, rather than regular options, are appropriate to hedge its exposure. What is more, Microsoft's total foreign exchange exposure is a weighted average of the exchange rates in all the countries in which it does business. This means that a basket option, where the option is on a portfolio of currencies, is an appropriate tool for hedging. An appropriate contract to negotiate with banks could therefore be an Asian basket option. The cost of this option is much less than a portfolio of put options, one for each month and each exchange rate (see Problem 5.23), but it gives the required protection.

Microsoft faces other financial risks. For example, it is exposed to interest rate risk on its bond portfolio. (When rates rise the portfolio loses money.) It also has two sorts of exposure to equity prices. It is exposed to the equity prices of the companies in which it invests. It is also exposed to its own equity price because it regularly repurchases its own shares as part of its stock awards program. It could use option strategies to hedge these risks.

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 5.4

# Procter and Gamble's Bizarre Deal

A particularly bizarre swap is the so-called 5/30 swap entered into by Bankers Trust (BT) and Procter and Gamble (P&G) on November 2, 1993. This was a five-year swap with semiannual payments. The notional principal was 200 million. BT paid P&G 5.30\% per annum. P&G paid BT the average 30-day CP (commercial paper) rate minus 75 basis points plus a spread. The average CP rate was calculated from observations on the 30-day commercial paper rate each day during the preceding accrual period.

The spread was zero for the first payment date (May 2, 1994). For the remaining nine payment dates, it was

$$
\max \left[ 0, \frac {98.5 \left(\frac {5 - \mathrm {yr} \mathrm {CMT}\%}{5.78\%}\right) - (30 - \mathrm {yr} \mathrm {TSY} \mathrm {Price})}{100} \right]
$$

In this, five-year CMT is the constant maturity Treasury yield (that is, the yield on a five-year Treasury note, as reported by the U.S. Federal Reserve). The 30-year TSY price is the midpoint of the bid and ask cash bond prices for the  $6.25\%$  Treasury bond maturing in August 2023. Note that the spread calculated from the formula is a decimal interest rate. It is not measured in basis points. If the formula gives 0.1 and the average CP rate is  $6\%$ , the rate paid by P&G is  $6\% - 0.75\% + 10\%$  or  $15.25\%$ .

P&G was hoping that the spread would be zero and the deal would enable it to exchange fixed-rate funding at  $5.30\%$  for funding at 75 basis points less than the commercial paper rate. In fact, interest rates rose sharply in early 1994, bond prices fell, and the swap proved very, very expensive. (See Problem 5.38.) provided by the S&P 500 with a guarantee that the return will not be negative. Another example of a (highly) structured product is the 5/30 transaction described in Business Snapshot 5.4. (In the case of this product, it is debatable whether Bankers Trust was meeting a client need or selling the client a product it did not need!)

Derivatives are very versatile instruments. They can be used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. One of the risks faced by a company that trades derivatives is that an employee who has a mandate to hedge or to look for arbitrage opportunities may become a speculator.

Jérôme Kerviel joined Société Générale (SocGen) in 2000 to work in the compliance area. In 2005, he was promoted and became a junior trader in the bank's Delta One products team. He traded equity indices such as the German DAX index, the French CAC 40, and the Euro Stoxx 50. His job was to look for arbitrage opportunities. These might arise if a futures contract on an equity index was trading for a different price on two different exchanges. They might also arise if equity index futures prices were not consistent with the prices of the shares constituting the index.

Kerviel used his knowledge of the bank's procedures to speculate while giving the appearance of arbitraging. He took big positions in equity indices and created fictitious trades to make it appear that he was hedged. In reality, he had large bets on the direction in which the indices would move. The size of his unhedged position grew over time to tens of billions of euros.

In January 2008, his unauthorized trading was uncovered by SocGen. Over a three-day period, the bank unwound his position for a loss of 4.9 billion euros. This was, at the time, the biggest loss created by fraudulent activity in the history of finance. (Later in the year, much bigger losses from Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme came to light.)

Rogue trader losses were not unknown at banks prior to 2008. For example, in the 1990s Nick Leeson, who worked at Barings Bank, had a similar mandate to Jérôme Kerviel's. His job was to arbitrage between Nikkei 225 futures quotes in Singapore and Osaka. Instead he found a way to make big bets on the direction of the Nikkei 225 using futures and options, losing  \$1 billion and destroying the 200-year-old bank. In 2002, it was found that John Rusnak at Allied Irish Bank had lost\$ 700 million from unauthorized foreign exchange trading. In 2011, Kweku Adoboli, a member of UBS's Delta One team, lost 2.3 billion by engaging in activities very similar to those of Jérôme Kerviel. The lesson from these losses is that it is important to define unambiguous risk limits for traders and then be very careful when monitoring what they do to make sure that the limits are adhered to.

# 5.6 Risk Management Challenges

Instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options, and structured products are versatile. They can be used for hedging, for speculation, and for arbitrage. (Hedging involves reducing risks; speculation involves taking risks; and arbitrage involves attempting to lock in a profit by simultaneously trading in two or more markets.) It is this very versatility that can cause problems. Sometimes traders who have a mandate to hedge risks or follow an arbitrage strategy become (consciously or unconsciously) speculators. The results can be disastrous. One example of this is provided by the activities of Jérôme Kerviel at Société Générale (see Business Snapshot 5.5).

To avoid the type of problems Société Générale encountered is an important risk management challenge. Both financial and nonfinancial corporations must set up controls to ensure that derivatives are being used for their intended purpose. Risk limits should be set and the activities of traders should be monitored daily to ensure that the risk limits are adhered to. We will be discussing this in later chapters.

# Summary

This chapter has reviewed spot trades, forwards, futures, swaps, and options contracts. A forward or futures contract involves an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. A swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows in the future in amounts dependent on the values of one or more market variables. There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price.

Forward, futures, and swap contracts have the effect of locking in the prices that will apply to future transactions. Options by contrast provide insurance. They ensure that the price applicable to a future transaction will not be worse than a certain level. Exotic options and structured products are tailored to the particular needs of corporate treasurers. For example, as shown in Business Snapshot 5.3, Asian basket options can allow a company to hedge its net exposure to several risks over a period of time. Derivatives now trade on a wide variety of variables. This chapter has reviewed those that provide payoffs dependent on the weather, oil, natural gas, and electricity. It has also discussed exotic options and structured products.

5.8 What is the difference between the over-the-counter market and the exchange-traded market? Which of the two markets do the following trade in: (a) a forward contract, (b) a futures contract, (c) an option, (d) a swap, and (e) an exotic option?
 5.9 You would like to speculate on a rise in the price of a certain stock. The current stock price is \$29, and a three-month call with a strike of \$30 costs \$2.90. You have \$5,800 to invest. Identify two alternative strategies, one involving an investment in the stock and the other involving an investment in the option. What are the potential gains and losses from each?
 5.10 Suppose that you own 5,000 shares worth 25 each. How can put options be used to provide you with insurance against a decline in the value of your holding over the next four months?
5.11 When first issued, a stock provides funds for a company. Is the same true of a stock option? Discuss.
 5.12 Suppose that a March call option to buy a share for \$50 costs \$2.50 and is held until March. Under what circumstances will the holder of the option make a profit? Under what circumstances will the option be exercised?

5.16 In the 1980s, Bankers Trust developed index currency option notes (ICONs). These are bonds in which the amount received by the holder at maturity varies with a foreign exchange rate. One example was its trade with the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. The ICON specified that if the yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate,  $S_T$ , is greater than 169 yen per dollar at maturity (in 1995), the holder of the bond receives 1,000. If it is less than 169 yen per dollar, the amount received by the holder of the bond is

$$
1, 0 0 0 - \max \left[ 0, 1, 0 0 0 \left(\frac {1 6 9}{S _ {T}} - 1\right) \right]
$$

When the exchange rate is below 84.5, nothing is received by the holder at maturity. Show that this ICON is a combination of a regular bond and two options.

5.17 Suppose that USD-sterling spot and forward exchange rates are as follows:

Spot 1.3080

180-day forward 1.3018

What opportunities are open to an arbitrageur in the following situations?

(a) A 180-day European call option to buy £1 for 1.27 costs 2 cents.

 (b) A 90-day European put option to sell £1 for 1.34 costs 2 cents.

5.21 A corn farmer argues: "I do not use futures contracts for hedging. My real risk is not the price of corn. It is that my whole crop gets wiped out by the weather." Discuss this viewpoint. Should the farmer estimate his or her expected production of corn and hedge to try to lock in a price for expected production?

5.22 An airline executive has argued: "There is no point in our hedging the price of jet fuel. There is just as much chance that we will lose from doing this as that we will gain." Discuss the executive's viewpoint.
5.23 Why is the cost of an Asian basket put option to Microsoft considerably less than the cost of a portfolio of put options, one for each currency and each maturity (see Business Snapshot 5.3)?
5.24 "Oil, gas, and electricity prices tend to exhibit mean reversion." What do you think is meant by this statement? Which energy source is likely to have the highest rate of mean reversion? Which is likely to have the lowest?

 5.26 Suppose that each day during July the minimum temperature is 68° Fahrenheit and the maximum temperature is 82° Fahrenheit. What is the payoff from a call option on the cumulative CDD during July with a strike of 250 and a payment rate of 5,000 per degree day?
5.27 Explain how a  $5 \times 8$  option contract on electricity for May 2024 with daily exercise works. Explain how a  $5 \times 8$  option contract on electricity for May 2024 with monthly exercise works. Which is worth more?
 5.28 A U.S. investor writes five call option contracts (i.e., options to buy 500 shares). The option price is \$3.50, the strike price is \$60, and the stock price is 57. What is the initial margin requirement?
 5.29 A trader shorts 500 shares of a stock when the price is 50. The initial margin is 160\% and the maintenance margin is 130\%. How much margin is required from the investor initially? How high does the price of the stock have to rise for there to be a margin call?

# Further Questions

5.31 A company enters into a short futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of wheat for 250 cents per bushel. The initial margin is \$3,000 and the maintenance margin is \$2,000. What price change would lead to a margin call? Under what circumstances could 1,500 be withdrawn from the margin account?
 5.32 A trader buys 200 shares of a stock on margin. The price of the stock is 20 per share. The initial margin is 60\% and the maintenance margin is 30\%. How much money does the trader have to provide initially? For what share price is there a margin call?
 5.33 The current price of a stock is \$94, and three-month European call options with a strike price of \$95 currently sell for \$4.70. An investor who feels that the price of the stock will increase is trying to decide between buying 100 shares and buying 2,000 call options (= 20 contracts). Both strategies involve an investment of \$9,400.

What advice would you give? How high does the stock price have to rise for the option strategy to be more profitable?

5.34 A bond issued by Standard Oil worked as follows. The holder received no interest. At the bond's maturity the company promised to pay \$1,000 plus an additional amount based on the price of oil at that time. The additional amount was equal to the product of 170 and the excess (if any) of the price of a barrel of oil at maturity over \$25. The maximum additional amount paid was \$2,550 (which corresponds to a price of \$40 per barrel). Show that the bond is a combination of a regular bond, a long position in call options on oil with a strike price of \$25, and a short position in call options on oil with a strike price of \$40.
 5.35 The price of gold is currently \$1,500 per ounce. The forward price for delivery in one year is \$1,700. An arbitrageur can borrow money at 5\% per annum. What should the arbitrageur do? Assume that the cost of storing gold is zero and that gold provides no income.
5.36 A company's investments earn the floating-rate minus  $0.5\%$ . Explain how it can use the quotes in Table 5.5 to convert them to (a) three-, (b) five-, and (c) ten-year fixed-rate investments.
