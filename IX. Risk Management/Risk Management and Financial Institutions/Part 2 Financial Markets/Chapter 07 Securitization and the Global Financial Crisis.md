# Securitization and the Global Financial Crisis

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) started in the United States in 2007 and continued throughout 2008. The crisis spread rapidly to other countries and from financial markets to the real economy. It was the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some financial institutions failed. Others had to be bailed out. It is an episode in financial history that risk managers need to understand and learn from.

We saw in the previous chapter how the GFC led to regulations that transformed the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. In later chapters, we will see how the GFC led to a major overhaul of the way banks are regulated and the way they manage risk. It therefore makes sense to examine the GFC at this stage in the book.

Derivatives such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options are one way in which risk can be transferred from one entity to another in the economy. Another is securitization. The securitization of mortgages in the United States played a major role in the GFC. In order to understand the GFC it is therefore necessary to understand how securitization works. This chapter therefore covers instruments such as asset-backed securities (ABSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

# 7.1 The U.S. Housing Market

A natural starting point for a discussion of the Global Financial Crisis is the U.S. housing market. Figure 7.1 shows the S&P/Case-Shiller composite-10 index for house prices in the United States between 1987 and 2021. This tracks house prices for ten major metropolitan areas in the United States. In about the year 2000, house prices started to rise much faster than they had in the previous decade. The very low level of interest rates between 2002 and 2005 was an important contributory factor, but the bubble in house prices was largely fueled by mortgage lending practices.

The 2000 to 2006 period was characterized by a huge increase in what is termed subprime mortgage lending. Subprime mortgages are mortgages that are considered to be significantly more risky than average. Before 2000, most mortgages classified as subprime were second mortgages. After 2000, this changed as financial institutions became more comfortable with the notion of a subprime first mortgage.

# 7.1.1 The Relaxation of Lending Standards

Mortgage lenders in the United States started to relax their lending standards in about 2000. This made house purchases possible for many families that had previously been considered to be not sufficiently creditworthy to qualify for a mortgage. These families increased the demand for real estate and prices rose. To mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders, the combination of more lending and rising house prices was attractive. More lending meant bigger profits. Rising house prices meant that the lending was well covered by the underlying collateral. If the borrower defaulted, the resulting foreclosure would lead to little or no loss.

How could mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders keep increasing their profits? Their problem was that, as house prices rose, it was more difficult for first-time buyers to afford a house. In order to continue to attract new entrants to the housing market, they had to find ways to relax their lending standards even more—and this is exactly what they did. The amount lent as a percentage of the house price increased. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) were developed where there was a low teaser rate of interest that would last for two or three years and be followed by a rate that was liable to be much higher. Lenders also became more cavalier in the way they reviewed mortgage applications. Indeed, the applicant's income and other information reported on the application were frequently not checked.

Why was the government not regulating the behavior of mortgage lenders? The answer is that the U.S. government had, since the 1990s, been trying to expand home ownership, and had been applying pressure to mortgage lenders to increase loans to lowand moderate-income households. Some state legislators (such as those in Ohio and Georgia) were concerned about what was going on and wanted to curtail predatory lending.[2] However, the courts decided that national standards should prevail.

A number of terms have been used to describe mortgage lending during the period leading up to the GFC. One is "liar loans," because individuals applying for a mortgage, knowing that no checks would be carried out, sometimes chose to lie on the application form. Another term used to describe some borrowers is "NINJA" (no income, no job, no assets). Some analysts realized that the mortgages were risky, but pricing in the market for securities created from the mortgages suggests that the full extent of the risks and their potential impact on markets was not appreciated until well into 2007.

Mian and Sufi (2009) have carried out research confirming that there was a relaxation of the criteria used for mortgage lending. Their research defines "high denial zip codes" as zip codes where a high proportion of mortgage applicants had been turned down in 1996, and shows that mortgage origination grew particularly fast for these zip codes between 2000 to 2007. (Zip codes are postal codes in the United States defining the area in which a person lives.) Moreover, their research shows that lending criteria were relaxed progressively through time rather than all at once because originations in high-denial zip codes were an increasing function of time during the 2000 to 2007 period. Zimmerman (2007) provides some confirmation of this. He shows that subsequent default experience indicates that mortgages made in 2006 were of a lower quality than those made in 2005 and these were in turn of lower quality than mortgages made in 2004. Standard & Poor's has estimated that subprime mortgage origination in 2006 alone totaled  $421 billion. AMP Capital Investors estimated that there was a total of$ 1.4 trillion of subprime mortgages outstanding in July 2007.

# 7.1.2 The Bubble Bursts

The result of the relaxation of lending standards was an increase in the demand for houses and a bubble in house prices. Prices increased very fast during the 2000 to 2006 period. All bubbles burst eventually and this one was no exception. In the second half of 2006, house prices started to edge down. One reason was that, as house prices increased, demand for houses declined. Another was that some borrowers with teaser rates found that they could no longer afford their mortgages when the teaser rates ended. This led to foreclosures and an increase in the supply of houses for sale. The decline in house prices fed on itself. Individuals who had borrowed  $100\%$ , or close to  $100\%$ , of the cost of a house found that they had negative equity (i.e., the amount owed on the mortgage was greater than the value of the house). Some of these individuals chose to default. This led to more foreclosures, a further increase in the supply of houses for sale, and a further decline in house prices.

One of the features of the U.S. housing market is that mortgages are non-recourse in some states. This means that, when there is a default, the lender is able to take possession of the house, but other assets of the borrower are off-limits.[5] Consequently, the borrower has a free American-style put option. He or she can at any time sell the house to the lender for the principal outstanding on the mortgage. (During the teasier-interest-rate period this principal typically increased, making the option more valuable.) Market participants realized belatedly how costly the put option could be. If the borrower had negative equity, the optimal decision was to exchange the house for the outstanding principal on the mortgage. The house was then sold, adding to the downward pressure on house prices.

It would be a mistake to assume that all mortgage defaulters were in the same position. Some were unable to meet mortgage payments and suffered greatly when they had to give up their homes. But many of the defaulters were speculators who bought multiple homes as rental properties and chose to exercise their put options. It was their tenants who suffered. There are also reports that some house owners (who were not speculators) were quite creative in extracting value from their put options. After handing the keys to their house to the lender, they turned around and bought (sometimes at a bargain price) another house that was in foreclosure. Imagine two people owning identical houses next to each other. Both have mortgages of  $250,000. Both houses are worth$ 200,000 and in foreclosure can be expected to sell for 170,000. What is the owners' optimal strategy? The answer is that each person should exercise the put option and buy the neighbor's house.

As foreclosures increased, the losses on mortgages also increased. Losses were high because houses in foreclosure were often surrounded by other houses that were also for sale. They were sometimes in poor condition. In addition, banks faced legal and other fees. In normal market conditions, a lender can expect to recover  $75\%$  of the amount owed in a foreclosure. In 2008 and 2009, recovery rates as low as  $25\%$  were experienced in some areas.

The United States was not alone in having declining real estate prices. Prices declined in many other countries as well. Real estate in the United Kingdom was particularly badly affected. As Figure 7.1 indicates, average house prices eventually recovered and were well above the previous peak by 2021.

# 7.2 Securitization

The originators of mortgages did not in many cases keep the mortgages themselves. They sold portfolios of mortgages to companies that created products for investors from them. This process is known as securitization. Securitization has been an important and useful tool for transferring risk in financial markets for many years. It underlies the originate-to-distribute model that was widely used by banks prior to 2007 and is discussed in Chapter 2.

Securitization played a part in the creation of the housing bubble. The behavior of mortgage originators was influenced by their knowledge that mortgages would be securitized.6 When considering new mortgage applications, the question was not: "Is this a credit we want to assume?" Instead it was: "Is this a mortgage we can make money from by selling it to someone else?"

When mortgages were securitized, the only information received about the mortgages by the buyers of the products that were created from them was the loan-to-value ratio (i.e., the ratio of the size of the loan to the assessed value of the house) and the borrower's FICO (credit) score. The reason why lenders did not check information on things such as the applicant's income, the number of years the applicant had lived at his or her current address, and so on, was that this information was considered irrelevant. The most important thing for the lender was whether the mortgage could be sold to others—and this depended primarily on the loan-to-value ratio and the applicant's FICO score.

It is interesting to note in passing that both the loan-to-value ratio and the FICO score were of dubious quality. The property assessors who determined the value of a house at the time of a mortgage application sometimes inflated valuations because they knew that the lender wanted a low loan-to-value ratio. Potential borrowers were sometimes counseled to take certain actions that would improve their FICO scores.[8]

We now consider the products that were created from the mortgages and sold in the market.

# 7.2.1 Asset-Backed Securities

An asset-backed security (ABS) is a security created from the cash flows of financial assets such as loans, bonds, credit card receivables, mortgages, auto loans, and aircraft leases. Sometimes, cash flow streams such as royalties from the future sales of a piece of music are even used. The way the security works is illustrated in Figure 7.2. A portfolio of assets (such as subprime mortgages) is sold by the originators of the assets to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and the cash flows from the assets are allocated to tranches. In Figure 7.2, there are three tranches. (This is a simplification. In reality there are usually many more than three tranches created.) These are the senior tranche, the mezzanine tranche, and the equity tranche. The portfolio has a principal of  $100 million. This is divided as follows:$ 75 million to the senior tranche, $20 million to the mezzanine tranche, and $5 million to the equity tranche. The senior tranche is promised a return of 6\%, the mezzanine tranche is promised a return of 10\%, and the equity tranche is promised a return of 30\%.

It sounds as though the equity tranche has the best deal, but this is not necessarily the case. The equity tranche is much less likely to realize its return than the other two tranches. Cash flows are allocated to tranches by specifying what is known as a waterfall.

Figure 7.2 Creation of an Asset-Backed Security from a Portfolio of Assets (simplified)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/72b85ab4-d19a-472c-ae6e-15b401e7d831/833402a058e9255a193612dc8609dd2f1e011ef0273989b355392ef2e9895407.jpg)

Figure 7.3 The Waterfall in an Asset-Backed Security

An approximation to the way a waterfall works is in Figure 7.3. There is a separate waterfall for interest and principal cash flows. Interest cash flows from the assets are allocated to the senior tranche until the senior tranche has received its promised return on its outstanding principal. Assuming that the promised return to the senior tranche can be made, cash flows are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche. If the promised return to the mezzanine tranche on its outstanding principal can be made and interest cash flows are left over, they are allocated to the equity tranche. Principal cash flows are used first to repay the principal of the senior tranche, then the mezzanine tranche, and finally the equity tranche.

The structure in Figure 7.2 typically lasts several years. The extent to which the tranches get their principal back depends on losses on the underlying assets. The first  $5\%$  of losses are borne by the principal of the equity tranche. If losses exceed  $5\%$ , the equity tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the mezzanine tranche. If losses exceed  $25\%$ , the mezzanine tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the senior tranche.

There are therefore two ways of looking at an ABS. One is with reference to the waterfall in Figure 7.3. Cash flows go first to the senior tranche, then to the mezzanine tranche, and then to the equity tranche. The other is in terms of losses. Losses of principal are first borne by the equity tranche, then by the mezzanine tranche, and then by the senior tranche.

The ABS is designed so that the senior tranche is rated AAA. The mezzanine tranche is typically rated BBB. The equity tranche is typically unrated. Unlike the ratings assigned to bonds, the ratings assigned to the tranches of an ABS are what might be termed "negotiated ratings." The objective of the creator of the ABS is to make the senior tranche as big as possible without losing its AAA credit rating. (This maximizes the profitability of the structure.) The ABS creator examines information published by rating agencies on how tranches are rated and may present several structures to rating agencies for a preliminary evaluation before choosing the final one. The creator of the ABS expects to make a profit because the weighted average return on the assets in the underlying portfolio is greater than the weighted average return offered to the tranches.

A particular type of ABS is a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). This is an ABS where the underlying assets are fixed-income securities. The procedures used by the market to value a CDO are outlined in Appendix L.

# 7.2.2 ABS CDOs

Finding investors to buy the senior AAA-rated tranches created from subprime mortgages was not difficult. Equity tranches were typically retained by the originator of the mortgages or sold to a hedge fund. Finding investors for the mezzanine tranches was more difficult. This led financial engineers to be creative (arguably too creative). Financial engineers created an ABS from the mezzanine tranches of ABSs that were created from subprime mortgages. This is known as an ABS CDO or Mezz ABS CDO and is illustrated in Figure 7.4. (Like the ABS in Figure 7.3, this is simplified.) The senior tranche of the ABS CDO is rated AAA. This means that the total of the AAA-rated instruments created in the example that is considered here is  $90\%$  ( $75\%$  plus  $75\%$  of  $20\%$ ) of the principal of the underlying mortgage portfolios. This seems high but, if the securitization were carried further with an ABS being created from the mezzanine tranches of ABS CDOs (and this did happen), the percentage would be pushed even higher.

In the example in Figure 7.4, the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS would probably be downgraded in the second half of 2007. However, it would receive the promised return if losses on the underlying mortgage portfolios were less than  $25\%$  because all losses of principal would then be absorbed by the more junior tranches. The AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO in Figure 7.4 is much more risky. It will get paid the promised return only if losses on the underlying portfolios are  $10\%$  or less. If losses are more than  $10\%$ , the

Figure 7.4 Creation of ABSs and an ABS CDO from Subprime Mortgages (simplified)

Table 7.1 Losses to Tranches in Figure 7.4

<table><tr><td>Losses to Subprime Portfolios</td><td>Losses to Mezzanine Tranche of ABS</td><td>Losses to Equity Tranche of ABS CDO</td><td>Losses to Mezzanine Tranche of ABS CDO</td><td>Losses to Senior Tranche of ABS CDO</td></tr><tr><td>10\%</td><td>25\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>0\%</td></tr><tr><td>15\%</td><td>50\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>33\%</td></tr><tr><td>20\%</td><td>75\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>67\%</td></tr><tr><td>25\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td><td>100\%</td></tr></table> equity tranche of the ABS is wiped out. The mezzanine tranche of the ABS bears more than  $5\%$  of the losses. This in turn means that the ABS CDO loses more than (5/20) or  $25\%$  of its principal so that the equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO are wiped out, and losses are incurred by the ABS CDO's senior tranche.

Consider, for example, the situation where losses are  $20\%$  on the underlying portfolios so that the mezzanine tranche of the ABS absorbs  $15\%$  of the losses. In this case, losses on the mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO are 15/20 or  $75\%$  of their principal. The first  $25\%$  is absorbed by the equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO. The senior tranche of the ABS CDO therefore loses 50/75 or  $67\%$  of its value. These and other results are summarized in Table 7.1.

Many banks have lost money investing in the senior tranches of ABS CDOs. The investments typically promised a return quite a bit higher than the bank's funding cost. Because they were rated AAA, the capital requirements were minimal. Merrill Lynch is an example of a bank that lost a great deal of money from investments in ABS CDOs. In July 2008, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell senior tranches of ABS CDOs that had previously been rated AAA and had a principal of 30.6 billion to Lone Star Funds for 22 cents on the dollar.[10]

# 7.2.3 CDOs and ABS CDOs in Practice

Figures 7.2 and 7.4 illustrate the nature of the securitizations that were done. In practice, many more tranches were created than those shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.4, and many of the tranches were thinner (i.e., corresponded to a narrower range of losses). Figure 7.5 shows a more realistic example of the structures that were created. This is adapted from an illustration by Gorton, which was taken from an article by UBS.[11]

In Figure 7.5, two ABS CDOs are created. One (referred to as a Mezz ABS CDO) is created from the BBB-rated tranches of ABSs (similarly to the ABS CDO in Figure 7.4); the other (referred to as a high-grade ABS CDO) is from the AAA, AA, and A tranches of ABSs. The figure shows a third level of securitization based on the A and AA tranches of the Mezz ABS CDO. There was typically a small amount of overcollateralization with the face value of the mortgages being greater (by  $1\%$  or  $2\%$ ) than the total face value of the ABS tranches. This created a cushion for investors, but by carrying out a similar analysis to that in Table 7.1 it is not difficult to see that investors in many of the tranches created would lose principal in situations where losses on the underlying subprime mortgage portfolios were moderately high.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/72b85ab4-d19a-472c-ae6e-15b401e7d831/2e070e5fdce625913d40862a38aea6c874798f762cf23fe2664d28842c5a0333.jpg)

Figure 7.5 More Realistic Example of Subprime Securitizations with ABS, ABS CDOs, and a CDO of CDO Being Created

The risks in the AAA-rated tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs were higher than either investors or rating agencies realized. One of the reasons for this involves correlation. The values of the tranches of ABSs depend on the default correlation of the underlying mortgages. The tranches of ABS CDOs are even more heavily dependent on these default correlations. If mortgages exhibit a fairly low default correlation (as they do in normal times), there is very little chance of a high overall default rate and the AAA-rated tranches of both ABSs and ABS CDOs are safe. But, many analysts overlooked the fact that correlations always increase in stressed market conditions. In 2005 to 2006, the models used by investors and rating agencies assumed correlations that were too low for the upheavals in the U.S. housing market that were considered likely by many observers. As explained in Business Snapshot 7.1, another mistake made by analysts was

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 7.1

# All BBBs Are Not the Same

Analysts tended to assume that the mezzanine tranche of an ABS, when rated BBB, can be considered to be identical to a BBB bond for the purposes of evaluating a CDO created from the mezzanine tranches. This is not a good assumption. The rating agency models attempted to ensure that the BBB tranche of an ABS had the same probability of loss, or the same expected loss, as a BBB bond. But the probability distribution of the loss is very different. Because the BBB tranches of ABSs were thin, it is much more likely that an investor in the BBB tranche of an ABS will lose everything than that this will happen for an investor in a BBB-rated bond. (This is sometimes referred to as "cliff risk.") This means that the risk characteristics of ABS CDO tranches created from the BBB tranches of ABSs are quite different from the risk characteristics of similar tranches created from BBB bonds.

One lesson from this is that it is dangerous to interpret ratings for tranches of an ABS—or any other structured product—in the same way that ratings for bonds are interpreted. For similarly rated bonds and structured products, the probability distributions of losses are markedly different.

to assume that the BBB-rated tranches of an ABS were equivalent in risk to BBB-rated bonds. There are important differences between the two and these differences can have a big effect on the valuation of the tranches of ABS CDOs.

# 7.3 The Losses

The defaults on mortgages in the United States had a number of consequences. Financial institutions and other investors who had bought the tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs lost money. Losses were also incurred by some mortgage originators because they had provided guarantees as to the quality of the mortgages that were securitized and because they faced lawsuits over their lending practices.

As often happens when losses are experienced in one segment of the debt market, there was a "flight to quality." Investors became reluctant to take any credit risk and preferred to buy Treasury instruments and similarly safe investments. Credit spreads (the extra return required for taking credit risks) increased sharply. It was difficult for many non-financial companies to obtain loans from banks. Indeed, banks became reluctant to lend to each other at all and interbank lending rates increased sharply.

The tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs were downgraded by rating agencies in the second half of 2007. The market for these tranches became very illiquid. Investors realized that they did not understand the tranches as well as they had previously thought and that they had placed too much reliance on credit ratings. This emphasizes the importance of transparency in financial markets. The products created during the period leading up to the GFC were very complicated. $^{12}$  Investors did not worry about this until problems emerged. They then found that the liquidity of the market was such that they could only trade at fire-sale prices.

Banks such as Citigroup, UBS, and Merrill Lynch suffered huge losses. There were many government bailouts of financial institutions. Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. The world experienced the worst recession since the 1930s. Unemployment increased. Even people in remote parts of the world that had no connection with U.S. financial institutions were affected.

Banks are now paying a price for the GFC. As we shall see in later chapters, they are required to keep more capital than before. They are also required to maintain certain liquidity ratios. Legislation such as Dodd-Frank in the United States increases the oversight of financial institutions and restricts their activities in areas such as proprietary trading.

# 7.4 What Went Wrong?

"Irrational exuberance" is a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to describe the behavior of investors during the bull market of the 1990s. It can also be applied to the period leading up to the GFC. Mortgage lenders, the investors in tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs that were created from residential mortgages, and the companies that sold protection on the tranches assumed that the U.S. house prices would continue to increase—or at least not decrease. There might be declines in one or two areas, but the possibility of the widespread decline shown in Figure 7.1 was a scenario not considered by most people.

Many factors contributed to the crisis that started in 2007. Mortgage originators used lax lending standards. Products were developed to enable mortgage originators to profitably transfer credit risk to investors. Rating agencies moved from their traditional business of rating bonds, where they had a great deal of experience, to rating structured products, which were relatively new and for which there were relatively little historical data. The products bought by investors were complex and in many instances investors and rating agencies had inaccurate or incomplete information about the quality of the underlying assets. Investors in the structured products that were created thought they had found a money machine and chose to rely on rating agencies rather than forming their own opinions about the underlying risks. The return promised on the structured products rated AAA was high compared with the returns promised on bonds rated AAA.

# 7.4.1 Regulatory Arbitrage

Many of the mortgages were originated by banks and it was banks that were the main investors in the tranches that were created from the mortgages. Why would banks choose to securitize mortgages and then buy the securitized products that were created? The answer concerns what is termed regulatory arbitrage. The regulatory capital banks were required to keep for the tranches created from a portfolio of mortgages was less than the regulatory capital that would be required for the mortgages themselves. This is because the mortgages were kept in what is referred to as the "banking book," whereas the tranches were kept in what is referred to as the "trading book." Capital requirements were different for the banking book and the trading book. We will discuss this point further in later chapters.

# 7.4.2 Incentives

Economists use the term "agency costs" to describe the situation where incentives are such that the interests of two parties in a business relationship are not perfectly aligned. The process by which mortgages were originated, securitized, and sold to investors was unfortunately riddled with agency costs.

The incentive of the originators of mortgages was to make loans that would be acceptable to the creators of the ABS and ABS CDO tranches. The incentive of the individuals who valued houses on which the mortgages were written was to please the lender by providing as high a valuation as possible so that the loan-to-value ratio was as low as possible. (Pleasing the lender was likely to lead to more business from that lender.) The main concern of the creators of ABSs and ABS CDOs was the profitability of the structures (i.e., the excess of the weighted average inflows over the weighted average outflows). They wanted the volume of AAA-rated tranches that they created to be as high as possible and found ways of using the published criteria of rating agencies to achieve this. The rating agencies were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated and about half their income came from structured products.

Another source of agency costs concerns financial institutions and their employees. Employee compensation falls into three categories: regular salary, the end-of-year bonus, and stock or stock options. Many employees at all levels of seniority in financial institutions, particularly traders, receive much of their compensation in the form of end-of-year bonuses. Traditionally, this form of compensation has focused employee attention on short-term performance. If an employee generates huge profits one year and is responsible for severe losses the next year, the employee will receive a big bonus the first year and will not have to return it the following year. The employee might lose his or her job as a result of the second-year losses, but even that is not a disaster. Financial institutions seem to be surprisingly willing to recruit individuals with losses on their resumes.

Imagine you are an employee of a financial institution investing in ABS CDOs in 2006. Almost certainly you would have recognized that there was a bubble in the U.S.

housing market and would expect that bubble to burst sooner or later. However, it is possible that you would decide to continue with your ABS CDO investments. If the bubble did not burst until after December 31, 2006, you would still get a nice bonus at the end of 2006!

# 7.5 Lessons from the Global Financial Crisis

Some of the lessons for risk managers from the GFC are as follows:

1. Risk managers should be watching for situations where there is irrational exuberance and make sure that senior management recognize that the good times will not last forever.
2. Correlations always increase in stressed markets. In considering how bad things might get, risk managers should not use correlations that are estimated from data collected during normal market conditions.
3. Recovery rates decline when default rates increase. This is true for almost all debt instruments, not just mortgages. (See Section 17.3.) In considering how bad things might get, risk managers should not use recovery rates that are estimated from data collected during normal market conditions.
4. Risk managers should ensure that the incentives of traders and other personnel encourage them to make decisions that are in the interests of the organization they work for. Many financial institutions have revised their compensation policies as a result of the crisis. Bonuses are now often spread out over several years rather than all being paid at once. If good performance in one year is followed by bad performance in the next, part of the bonus for the good-performance year that has not yet been paid may be clawed back.
5. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. AAA-rated tranches of structured products promised returns that were higher than the returns promised on AAA bonds by 100 basis points or more. A sensible conclusion from this for an investor would be that further analysis is needed because there are likely to be risks in the tranches that are not considered by rating agencies.
6. Investors should not rely on ratings. They should understand the assumptions made by rating agencies and carry out their own analyses.
7. Transparency is important in financial markets. If there is a lack of transparency (as there was for ABS CDOs), markets are liable to dry up when there is negative news.
8. Re-securitization, which led to the creation of ABS CDOs and CDOs of CDOs, was a badly flawed idea. The assets used to create ABSs in the first leg of the securitization should be as well diversified as possible. There is then nothing to be gained from further securitization.

Business Snapshot 7.1 makes the point that many market participants incorrectly considered ABS tranches rated BBB to be equivalent to BBB bonds. Business Snapshot 7.2 suggests a trading strategy that could be followed by people who realized that this was not so.

# BUSINESS SNAPSHOT 7.2

# A Trading Opportunity?

A few traders made a huge amount of money betting against the subprime mortgage market. Suppose that you are analyzing markets in 2005 and 2006, but are uncertain about how subprime mortgages will perform. Is there a trading opportunity open to you?

The answer is that Mezz ABS CDOs do present a trading opportunity. Figure 7.5 is a simplification of how tranches were actually created. In practice, there were usually three ABS tranches, rated  $\mathrm{BBB + }$ , BBB, and  $\mathrm{BBB - }$ . Each was very thin—about  $1\%$  wide. Separate Mezz ABS CDOs were created from each of the three types of tranches. Consider the Mezz ABS CDO created from  $\mathrm{BBB + }$  tranches. After analyzing the mortgages in the pools used to create the  $\mathrm{BBB + }$  tranches, a trader would conclude that the pools had similar risk profiles and that there would be a tendency for either all tranches to be safe or all to be wiped out. (Because the tranches are only  $1\%$  wide, it is unlikely that they would be only partially wiped out.) This means that all the Mezz ABS CDO tranches created from ABS tranches rated  $\mathrm{BBB + }$  are either safe or wiped out. The Mezz ABS CDO tranches are therefore much the same as each other and should have the same rating ( $\mathrm{BBB + }$  in the case we are considering).

Having recognized this, what should the trader do? He or she should buy junior ABS CDO tranches (which are inexpensive because of their rating) and short senior ABS CDO tranches (which are relatively expensive). If the underlying principal is the same for both trades, the trader can then relax knowing that a profit has been locked in.

This emphasizes the point in Business Snapshot 7.1 that BBB tranches (particularly very thin BBB tranches) should not be considered equivalent to BBB bonds when a securitization is planned.

# Summary

The GFC had a devastating effect on financial markets throughout the world. Its origins can be found in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. government was keen to encourage home ownership. Interest rates were low. Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders found it attractive to do more business by relaxing their lending standards. Products for securitizing mortgages had been developed so that the investors bearing the credit risk were not necessarily the same as the original lenders. Rating agencies were prepared to give an AAA rating to senior tranches that were created by securitization. There was no shortage of buyers for these AAA-rated tranches because their yields were higher than the yields on AAA-rated bonds. The compensation arrangements in banks focused their employees' attention on short-term profits, and as a result they chose to ignore the housing bubble and its potential impact on some very complex products they were trading.

House prices rose as both first-time buyers and speculators entered the market. Some mortgages had included a low "teaser rate" for two or three years. After the teaser rate ended, some borrowers faced higher interest rates that they could not afford and had no choice but to default. This led to foreclosures and an increase in the supply of houses being sold. The price increases between 2000 and 2006 began to be reversed. Speculators and others who found that the amount owed on their mortgages was greater than the value of their houses (i.e., they had negative equity) defaulted. This accentuated the price decline.

Many factors played a part in creating the U.S. housing bubble and resulting recession. These include irrational exuberance on the part of market participants, poor incentives, too much reliance on rating agencies, not enough analysis by investors, and the complexity of the products that were created. The GFC has provided a number of lessons for risk managers. As we will see later in this book, it has also led to a major overhaul of bank regulation and bank legislation.

# Further Questions

7.14 Suppose that the principals assigned to the senior, mezzanine, and equity tranches are  $70\%$ ,  $20\%$ , and  $10\%$  instead of  $75\%$ ,  $20\%$  and  $5\%$  for both ABSs and ABS CDO in Figure 7.4. How are the results in Table 7.1 affected?
7.15 Investigate what happens as the width of the mezzanine tranche of the ABS in Figure 7.4 is decreased, with the reduction in the mezzanine tranche principal being divided equally between the equity and senior tranches. In particular, what is the effect on Table 7.1?
