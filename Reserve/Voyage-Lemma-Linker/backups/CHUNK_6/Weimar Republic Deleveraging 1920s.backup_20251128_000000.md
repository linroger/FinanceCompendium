# Weimar Republic Deleveraging 1920s

This document provides a timeline of Germany's Weimar Republic during the years from 1914 through 1924. Both German industrial production and the German stock market peaked around the start of World War I in 1914. It wasn't until 1927 that the economy reached its 1914 level and not until around 1960 that real stock market prices returned to their 1914 peak.255 Within this long period of inflationary deleveraging is one of the most acute periods of inflationary deleveraging ever, which occurred in 1922-1923. This is a period of special interest and focus to us because of the perspective it provides. As with other cases, I want to convey market movements as well as notable historical developments, especially the very large market whipsaws that accompanied the near total destruction of financial wealth during this time.

The timeline is divided into four periods. These periods were selected to represent distinct phases in the depreciation of the mark. When possible, events are arranged chronologically within each of the phases.

# Overview

Depressions arise when (a) debt service obligations become unsustainably large in relation to the cash flows to service them, (b) investors seek to convert a large amount of financial assets into cash, and (c) monetary policy is ineffective. Because monetary policy is ineffective in creating credit, credit creation turns into credit contraction until this fundamental imbalance between the need for cash and the amount of cash available is rectified. Until the fundamental imbalance is rectified, a cash shortage causes debt and liquidity problems. This cash shortage, and these liquidity problems, cause financial assets to be sold for cash (i.e., M0), which worsens the cash shortage and puts the central bank in the position of having to choose between (a) keeping the amount of money the same and allowing the shortage of cash to become more acute, thus driving up interest rates and causing the credit crisis to worsen, and (b) printing more money, thus depreciating its value. The Weimar Republic case study, like the 1980s Latin America case study, is interesting in examining the dynamic behind the process of alleviating the fundamental imbalance primarily through the creation of cash (i.e., M0)

As with the other cases of deleveraging, in this case, there were many swings in markets and economic conditions.md) so, from the perspective of someone trying to navigate through this period, it is important to understand these swings and see the cause-effect relationships behind them.

To help to convey the big picture before I get into the chronology, I want to show a few charts of the total timeframe. The ones that follow show the real stock market, the real exchange rate, real economic activity, and the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate from 1913-1927, with the vertical lines designating the beginnings of each of the four phases referred to in the table of contents. The percentages noted in each chart are meant to convey the very big swings along the way. It is very important for us to understand what caused these swings and to visualize how our game plan would have navigated these. The chronology that follows will explain these movements.

In order to gain a big picture perspective, it is also important to view Germany's deleveraging within the context of the world economy at the time. To convey this, the table below shows industrial production (a proxy for economic activity) for Germany, France, the UK, and the US. Note that (a) Germany's economic activity plunged more severely than other economies after the war, (b) the German economy grew, while the UK and France contracted in 1921, and (c) the German economy plunged while the UK and France grew in 1923. You will also note the recovery that followed the post-war deleveraging and that occurred in 1920-22, and that it was followed by the very classic inflationary deleveraging that occurred in 1922-1923. The reasons will also be made clear in the chronology.

# World War I Period 1914 – November 1918

World War I began in 1914 and ended in November 1918. It set the stage for the period that we will be examining because it resulted in Germany having very large domestic and foreign debts. During the war years, Germany spent a lot of money on the war, much of which was financed by borrowing from its people; it then lost the war and acquired a huge foreign debt in the form of war reparations. While Germany's deleveraging was largely a consequence of the debts arising from the war, deleveragings are debt crises, regardless of their causes, so the fact that Germany's arose from the war is essentially irrelevant to our examination of the inflationary deleveraging dynamic.256

As with most countries at the time, Germany was on the gold standard at the beginning of the war – i.e., to borrow money, it guaranteed the value of the money by promising to convert money into gold. When it was unable to meet those commitments it defaulted – i.e., it broke its promise to allow holders of currency to convert it to gold.257

For Germany default came on August 4, 1914 when the Reichsbank (Germany's central bank) "suspended" the conversion of money for gold. As with all other countries' suspensions of gold convertibility, this default occurred because investors executed their right to turn their money into gold in large numbers, which caused the government's gold reserves to fall a lot, so that it became obvious that the central bank would not have enough gold to fulfill its commitment. Whenever (a) the amount of money in circulation is much greater than the amount of gold held in reserves to back the money at the designated price of conversion, and (b) investors are converting money into gold because they are worried about the value of their money, the central bank is in the untenable position of having to either reduce the supply of money in circulation (i.e., tighten credit) or to end convertibility and print more money. Central banks almost always choose suspending convertibility and printing more money. Such was the case in mid-August 1914 in Germany. At that time, the Reichsbank chose to break its promise to deliver gold so that it could freely print money. On the same date, another law passed that authorized the Reichsbank to discount short-term bills issued by the Treasury and to use them, together with commercial bills, as collateral for its notes. So also, on August 4 the central bank decided to free itself from all constraints that limited its ability to print money and simultaneously initiate money printing activities. According to the weekly statements of the Reichsbank, in the two weeks from July 24 to August 7, the quantity of the Reichsbank notes in circulation increased by more than two billion marks,258 an increase of approximately 30%. Knowing that this move would lead to inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), on the same date (August 4), a "Law Concerning Maximum Prices," which imposed price controls and a freeze in rents,259 was also passed by the Reichstag. Nonetheless, as a result of this decision to eliminate constraints on money production, currency and credit inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) began in Germany directly after the outbreak of the war.

Before 1914 gold coins represented about 40% of the monetary base, but they were withdrawn from circulation by the Reichsbank after the outbreak of war. The Reichsbank's gold reserves amounted to 1,253 million marks on July 31, 1914. Because the central bank took the private gold into its possession (i.e., because the government essentially confiscated the gold from private investors), at the end of 1918, the Reichsbank had 2,262 million marks in gold –i.e., its gold reserves had nearly doubled.260

These moves—i.e., eliminating the link between currency and gold, printing a lot of money to buy government debt, and establishing price controls—are classic ingredients of reflation. In all cases, they are accompanied by currency devaluations and gold revaluations. They are frequently accompanied by the government outlawing gold and the government taking it into its possession. Often these moves are accompanied by foreign exchange

#### controls. The last time this mix of policies was deployed in the U.S. was in 1971. These things happened in Germany in 1914.

The printing of money was primarily to fund the government's deficits and alleviate other debt burdens. The table below shows, in millions marks, the total income, expenditure and budget deficit of the German Reich during the years 1914-1918. As conveyed, in these war years, the amounts of money spent and the deficits increased a lot.

The difference between the total expenditure and the total income was covered by issuing Treasury bills that were bought by the Reichsbank, which directly increased the currency in circulation,261 fueling inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). Naturally, investors worried about the depreciating value of their money ran to gold, essentially the only noncredit based money, so gold was outlawed.

The debt that the German government issued to finance the war was primarily floating debt because investors had become wary about lending the government money in exchange for longer maturity debt,262 fearing that they would be paid back with depreciated money. These fears were learned, arising from investors who had held long-term bonds being burned. The issuing of floating debt required the government to print more money faster in order to pay off these short-term debts in depreciated rather than hard money, which drove depositors into even shorter term money, and so on, until in the autumn of 1916 investors became wary about lending, even short term, so the sums yielded by the loans were always less than the amounts of the floating debt.

After the outbreak of the war, the publication of war statistics stopped. They were only renewed in 1920.263 As a result, data for this period is sparse.

# Post-War Period November 1918 - December 1921

1918

Germany lost the war, so naturally stocks plunged and there was capital flight from Germany's paper. As a result, the mark plunged from November 1918 to July 1919 264 and the debt soared. From the end of October 1918 to the end of March 1919, the floating debt of the Reich rose by 15.6 billion paper marks,265 an increase of 32%. In contrast with the war years, the mark's depreciation occurred via the dollar exchange rate as the dollar became the world's most important currency. As a result of this depreciation, prices of imported goods rose more rapidly than prices of domestic goods. From November 1918 until July 1919, M0 grew at an annualized rate of 102%, the price of gold in paper marks increased by 210%, the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate averaged an annualized 48%, and industrial production fell at an annualized rate of 43%.

The signing the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919 triggered a new plunge in the exchange rate as it then became obvious the debts imposed on Germany by the Treaty would have a devastating effect on Germany's

balance of payments266 for years to come. At this point, Germany was saddled with a very large domestic debt and a large foreign debt.

While from October 1918 through early 1919, share prices fell a lot, in the second half of 1919 they rose a lot in paper mark terms due to the very rapid depreciation of the mark. This was the beginning of the very classic dynamic of rapid depreciations in the value of money causing illusions of price gains of stocks and tangible assets. In the case of Germany's stock market, at the time, the rise was much less than the currency's depreciation and less than the rise in the price of gold (which reflects the value of money), stocks were a disastrous investment. The indexed value of stocks in gold terms fell from 69.3 in October 1918 to 8.5 in February 1920. Similarly, in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) adjusted terms, stocks were a horrible investment, i.e., in February 1920, real share prices had fallen to only about 12 percent of their 1913 value.267 Similarly, from a foreign investor's perspective, investing in Germany's stock market was a losing proposition. So, during this time gold was the preferred asset to hold, shares were a disaster even though they rose, bonds were wiped out, and rent controls made real estate very bad. In other words, the market action was clearly consistent with that of an inflationary deleveraging.

The end of World War I brought economic problems to almost everyone. As is typical of deleveragings, economic problems brought clashes between capitalists, "the haves," and the proletariat, "the have-nots," and these clashes caused big political shifts. These clashes were not confined to Germany—they were global. For example, the Russian Revolution occurred in November 1918, where the proletariat took wealth and power from the capitalists.268

1919 – 1920

In 1919, the German government (i.e., the Reich) found it impossible to raise the money it needed without continuing to issue new floating debt at an accelerating rate. The revenues of the Reich had only a modest increase so this revenue increase didn't do much to reduce their overwhelming reliance on deficit financing, which was then forced to be almost exclusively through short-term borrowing.269 At times when governments need more money than they can borrow from foreign investors, (i.e., when the economy is depressed and budget deficits are large), they are faced with the choice of directly taxing the rich (who are the only ones who can afford to "contribute") or indirectly taxing them by printing money which devalues the claims of debt holders. They typically do both. Germany did both.

Big taxes of various forms were enacted. Specifically:

(1) In 1919 and 1920 numerous new laws were put into place to create numerous and complex taxes. In fact, Matthias Erzberger, the finance minister at the time, proclaimed that in the future Germany the rich should be no more.270

(2) In December 1919 the government passed the "War Levy on Capital Gains" and the "Extraordinary War Levy for Fiscal Year 1919," creating wealth taxes that were strongly progressive, rising from 10% of the value of assets at five thousand marks to 65% at above seven million marks. According to original estimates, the tax was expected to take up to one third of German national wealth, which would then be used to redeem the state's war debts. However, since the tax was for the most part payable in cash and those who were taxed couldn't convert their wealth into cash fast enough, the Reich had no choice but to permit payment by installment. In fact in some cases it could be spread over up to 28 ½ years, or in the case of landed property up to forty-seven years.271 The government treated these tax debts as mortgages.

(3) The Secretary of the State proposed that the taxes due should take the form of mortgages denominated in gold in favor of the State and should be imposed on all properties, though interest payments could be made in paper money that was price indexed (e.g., for farmers they were indexed to grain prices). However, when it came to paying its debts, the government did so in paper money that could depreciate. Clearly, the government was allowing itself, but not the taxpayers, to depreciate its debts through money creation. As an additional wealth tax, the government proposed that a certain percentage of the equity of public and private companies should be given to the State.272

(4) The "Reich Emergency Contribution" taxed the wealthier classes as part of the great Erzberger tax reforms. It was also payable in installments, which was contrary to the original conception, so it became a recurrent charge on wealth in addition to wealth holders' existing liabilities under the "Defense Contribution" of 1919 and the extraordinary "War Levy" of 1917.273 Because of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and the method of valuing real property and industrial plants, those who owned securities or mortgages (i.e., financial assets) were worse off than landowners and industrialists (i.e., owners of tangible assets).

At the time, economists recognized that the claims of those who held financial assets were too large to be paid back in the promised manner (i.e., with the value of money being maintained) without resulting in great hardship. So, rather than wanting to fight inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), policy makers explicitly advocated accelerated inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) as a means of taxation. The plan was for the Reich to redeem its long-term debt prematurely at par value by obtaining the cash from the central bank, or to convert its long-dated bonds into treasury bills. This would eliminate the threat of the government going bankrupt. Also, it was widely recognized that depreciating the currency would have

### stimulative effects on the economy and make Germany more competitive in world markets. As one official put it, it was better "to exploit to the full the opportunities afforded by money creation, than to cripple the forces of production and the spirit of enterprise by a confiscatory tax policy."274

It was widely recognized that, though breaking the commitment to pay debts in money of stable value is evil, it is the lesser of two evils. For example, a German economist at the time, Dr. Bendixen, who favored printing money to devalue debtors' claims said, "I have never denied that what I propose is an evil, but it is the only means of preventing a still worse evil…We may deprecate the fraudulent excesses of speculation and of entrepreneurial activity that the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) would bring—and not without reason: but are we on this account to prefer the corpsestrewn battlefield into which the repudiation of the War Loans would turn our economy?" Bendixen believed it would be impossible, or at least extremely injurious to the economy, to repay the War Loans out of taxation. He also regarded inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) as preferable to the type of tax system that—under existing political conditions—was threatening wealth holders and high income groups in the manner proposed. Similarly, Keynes said, "The inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is the worse, because it is worse in an impoverished world to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier."275 By "rentier" he meant the person who rented out his capital.

Germany's total debt—i.e., its external debt on top of its internal debt—was so huge that it must have been obvious to anyone with a sharp pencil that any attempt to service it, let alone to pay it off, would have caused a deflationary deleveraging of unimaginable severity, so it was not going to happen. No government could have survived such a policy. When there isn't much chance that the government can service or pay back its debt via taxation there is always an implicit risk that it will print currency and depreciate the currency's value. This is not just an observation of Germany at the time—it is a timeless and universal truth.276

In contrast with the easy money policies that existed in Germany at the time, tight money policies were being followed in other countries because, at the end of 1919 and beginning of 1920, Britain and the USA were in booms that had to be brought under control. For example, interest rates on three-month money, which were less than 6% in the first nine months of 1919, averaged about 8% in 1920 in the U.S.

Naturally, high tax rates on the wealthy coming at the same time as their net worths were being eroded in their investments and due to the bad economy, caused them to desperately try to preserve their rapidly shrinking wealth at all costs. This led to extremely high rates of tax evasion and the flight of capital abroad.277 This is typical in deleveragings. It also typically leads to governments establishing controls on both tax evasion and citizens of the country taking money abroad. As we will see shortly, that is what happened in Germany.

At the time, the Allies (i.e., the countries that won the war) were understandably worried that Germany would pay them back with worthless paper money, so on December 13, 1919, they reached an agreement with Germany that forbid the Reichsbank from disposing of its gold reserve.278 As we will see later, this gold stock was to play an important role in determining how events transpired in subsequent years.

#### The charts below show the exchange rate changes during this period and a longer-term chart to put these moves in context. As shown, this was a period of great weakness in the mark, which is obviously consistent with the fundamentals of the time.

Currency depreciation is, in cases other than hyperinflation, normally stimulative to short-term economic activity and bullish for inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge assets and stocks. So, these declines in the mark stimulated the German economy in late 1919 and early 1920. They gave an especially strong stimulus to exports, which is normal.279 Also, the low real interest rates stimulated domestic demand. So, the German economy picked up, and the number of unemployed fell rapidly. Because of the mark's decline, the divergence between German prices and world prices was large and German wages remained low. This caused German businesses to do well, so confidence in the stock market improved and prices rose. Because of the very rapid currency depreciation and price declines of Government securities, mortgages, and debentures—in fact, all securities with a fixed yield—declined in value.

So, in 1919, this decline in the value of debt instruments also drove investors to buy shares and other assets like gold for their "intrinsic" value. The public now saw that the paper mark and debt could no longer fulfill the function of the "store of value."280

The period between the start of 1919 and spring 1920 was one when stock prices rose continuously (nearly doubling) because of buying for their intrinsic value, unemployment fell, and the currency entered a period of "relative stabilization." The chart below shows stock prices during this period.

## 1921

As noted earlier, central banks in other countries pursued tight money policies in 1920. These tight money conditions in other countries in 1920 led to a bad world contraction in 1921. Though this was called a deleveraging, which was then the name for all economic contractions, it was primarily driven by monetary policies, so this contraction had some of the markings of what we refer to as a recession, though certainly it was a very bad recession. Between 1920 and 1921, industrial production fell by 20% in the US, by 18.6% in the UK, and by 11% in France, largely as a result of this monetary tightening. In the US, unemployment reached 12%. At the bottom of the contraction, which occurred around mid-1921, 22% of the total population was out of work.281 So it was certainly a very severe global contraction.

However, economic conditions.md) in Germany in 1920 and 1921 continued to be very different from those in the other leading industrial countries—most importantly, Germany did not suffer a severe contraction because of its reflationary policies—mostly because German monetary policies were easy (largely because of its easy money policies and the absence of a tie with gold), while those in other countries were tight.282

As a result of these relative economic conditions.md) and the differences in monetary policy that accompanied them, the German exchange rate became more stable between April 1920 and May 1921. That was because conditions in other countries were so bad that they drove investors to Germany. However this currency stability and weakness in other economies naturally created difficulties for German export-dependent industries. But domestic demand remained strong. As a result, German industrial production increased by 20.4% between 1920 and 1921, on the heels of the 46% increase that occurred between 1919 and 1920. So 1919-1921 was a period of strong growth for Germany. Average unemployment during 1921 declined to only 2.8% of trade union members, which was below the 1920 average of 3.8%.283 Still in 1921-22, German industrial production remained much lower than in 1913, so this period of growth was within the period of greater economic contraction for Germany.

In that year, the money supply remained almost stable—e.g., the gold mark was worth 14.2 paper marks in April 1920 and 14.9 in March 1921, as the world's deflationary contraction and Germany's favorable relative growth supported the mark. In spite of that, the budget deficit was huge—roughly 15% of GDP—which equated to 60% of the total expenses (in the financial year of 1920-21) and that large deficit was financed by the issue of Treasury bills. So, in the period from February 1920 to May 1921, the supply of floating debt was increased a lot; however, the inflationary effects were mitigated by the global deflationary period.284

In 2Q1920 the German economy began to weaken along with the global economy. The German currency had been stable until May 1921, but then it began to soften. Then, along with the economy weakening, the Allies restructured Germany's external debt via the "London Ultimatum". The "agreement" was called the "ultimatum" because the allies threatened to occupy the Ruhr Basin within six days if Germany didn't agree to the plan. It specified the final payments plan which set war reparations at 132 billion gold marks, with 50 billion in gold marks bonds up front and 2 billion gold marks in the first year, plus 1 billion gold marks over the next few months, and some other taxes.285 In other words, it solidified a huge debt burden for Germany. Naturally that implied that domestic debts and the currency would have to be depreciated because the government faced the choice of either (a) printing and taxing, or (b) having money and credit tighten and the weak economy contract, and it was obvious which they would choose.

While the German government was being pressured by these circumstances to print more money, Allied governments wanted German currency stabilization because mark weakness made Germany more competitive.

## British industry wanted "the competitive advantage on world markets which the fall in the mark was giving to German industry to be curtailed" by a currency stabilization. At the time, unemployment in Britain reached 23.4%. But, as always, fundamentals won out over the Allies' wishes, and German "currency dumping" began in May 1921.

The new tax sources, made available to the Reich between 1919 and 1921 under the "Erzberger Reforms", had increased the revenues of the Reich during fiscal year 1921. There were enough tax revenues to cover ordinary expenditures but not reparations. By the beginning of 1922, tax revenues had increased not only in nominal terms, but even in gold mark values, while expenditures were strictly controlled. In the first quarter of the new fiscal year (April-June 1922), Germany was able to finance not only its entire ordinary and extraordinary expenditure out of taxation, but even to apply a considerable sum from the same source to meeting reparations charges.

So let's review. Economic weakness and the Ultimatum of London of May 1921 provoked the collapse of the mark.286 It was originally proposed that reparations would equal an annuity of eight billion gold marks which would have taken 23.2% of German national income in 1919, 21.3% in 1920, 19.8% in 1921 and 19.0% in 1922. But these burdens were reduced to three billion gold marks by the London Ultimatum due to a more realistic assessment of Germany's capacity to pay. Still, three billion gold marks represented an enormous burden of 7.4% of German national income in 1921, 7.1% in 1922 and 8.0% in 1923, especially on top of German's other debts.287

Between 1919 and 1922 Germany paid at least the eight billion, which is the amount credited to Germany by the Reparations Commission, though it is widely estimated that the payments were considerably more. The independent and unconnected estimates by Keynes and by Moulton and McGuire—twenty-six billion—are probably nearer the truth. In current gold marks aggregate German national income in the four years 1919-22 was 287.7 billion. Actual payments then ranged between 3.1% and 21.8% of this but were most likely (following the Keynes or Moulton/McGuire estimates) about 10%.288 A historian recently calculated that a level of taxation equal to thirty-five percent of national income would have been required to defray postwar expenditures on reparations, social welfare, and the general running costs of the government.289 The estimate of the gold mark value of the Reich's current payments on reparations account was 4.9 billions in 1919, falling to 2.1 billions in 1920. But with the London Ultimatum of May 1921, the gold mark value of payments began to rise again: 2.8 billions in that year and 3.4 billions in 1922.290 In other words, it was too much.

We can get a sense of the magnitude of the government's funding needs by looking at the next table. Reparations are included in the budget deficit numbers. As shown, it was huge. To fund this gap, the Reichsbank had to print the money to make purchases of this debt.

The next chart shows the exchange rate, M0, the CPI, and the velocity of money during the 1920-24 period. Notice that the decline in the currency value and the increase in the velocity of money led the increase in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), which led M0 growth as the central bank chose to accommodate these demands. This is typical in all monetary inflations, so you will also observe them to be true in the Brazilian, Argentine, Russian, and Thai cases. In other words, money supply growth did not cause these other things to happen; rather investors' movements of capital out of debt and out of currency caused these changes, which the Reichsbank accommodated by printing money (i.e., M0). The sudden rise in the velocity of money after July 1921 was due to the outbreak of a new crisis of doubt in the value of holding cash.291

In August 1921 it was clear that getting adequate income and wealth taxes from the rich was difficult (largely because incomes were down and wealth was illiquid), and those who opposed the "taxation of material wealth" in the Reichstag were strong enough to be able to block many of the wealth tax attempts. The government then abandoned the idea of a mortgage tax in favor of heavy taxes on consumption goods because they were more effective. It is important to realize that wealth taxes are usually ineffective because much wealth is illiquid, and because collections on the "mortgage" don't generate much cash.

After the autumn of 1921, the depreciation of the German mark became even more rapid and economic activity strengthened further. It was clear that a falling mark and rising inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) produced prosperity. According to the official statistics, the number of unemployed, which was high at the beginning of 1919, fell continually until the summer of 1922, when unemployment practically disappeared. However, any time there was an improvement of the mark there then was an increase of unemployment (see March-July 1920; November 1920-February 1921; December 1921-January 1922), and every depreciation of the mark was followed by an improvement in conditions of the labor market (January-February 1920; July-November 1920; April-November 1921; and then during the first half of 1922.) So it was clear that monetary stimulation and the weak exchange rate stimulated the economy. When the mark depreciated, foreign and domestic demands for goods increased. Foreign purchasers wanted to profit by the greater purchasing power of their own money in the Germany market, and the prospect of continuous increases in prices stimulated the demand to buy goods as a means of getting out of a depreciating currency. When the mark improved, foreign demand declined and in Germany there occurred what in the summer of 1920 was called "the buyers' strike."

The German press called the industrial and commercial situation between October 1921 and the summer of 1922 one of "general liquidation" because the shops were empty due to foreigners buying a lot because the mark was cheap, and Germans buying a lot because they worried about inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). At the beginning of November 1921, the flight from the mark became a panic which rapidly spread through all classes of society.

In November, the depreciation of the mark provoked a big increase in orders, especially for inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge and export items. The metallurgical industries were working at full capacity, so that they had to introduce overtime, and they refused to accept new orders. As cars are long-lived, the automobile industry had a period of peak prosperity. The textile trade had bookings for several months ahead, and the cotton firms refused to take new orders. It was clear that accelerating inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and rising trade competitiveness from the depreciating value of the mark, rather than more sustainable drivers of growth, provided this demand.292

# Then, from November 26 to December 1, 1921, the mark strengthened by about a third—i.e., the dollar rate fell sharply from 293 to 190 paper marks.293 This big whipsaw appears to have been due to a short squeeze as the speculation against the mark in many ways (typically from borrowing it and Germans keeping money outside the country) became overdone. As always, the mark's strength hurt the economy. In fact, press reports from that

time declared that the improvement of the mark had been a catastrophe for German industry.294 Trade orders rapidly diminished. Eventually, the shorts were squeezed and the impacts on trade and capital flows began to work against the mark.

So in February 1922 the mark began to fall, and on March 7 it was all the way back to 262 paper marks to the dollar. And the economy picked up again. A new wave of commercial and industrial activity followed in the form of panic buying. "It is no longer simply a zeal for acquiring, or even a rage: it is a madness," according to one observer of the time. Merchants bought for fear that if they waited the stocks would be exhausted. As a result, 1922 was a boom year, though in 1922 (which was the year of greatest economic expansion after the war) the level of economic activity still was no more than 70-80% of production in 1913, so despite this strength, the economy was still in the contraction that began in 1918.295

While one might think that the boom of 1922 was good for workers, it wasn't. That is because there was a big contrast between the continual increase of German production and wages, which did not keep up with inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). Also, there was a deficiency in agricultural production due to the lack of certain chemical fertilizers and a shortage of labor. At the time there was a widely reported "fall in the intensity of labor" in 1919-1923,296 which hurt productivity. However, what was good for the average man was that during the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), rents fell on an inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) adjusted basis to almost zero. This was obviously bad for those who owned rental properties.

The inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and negative real interest rates encouraged borrowing to invest as well as to spend. Real investment was at least as high as before the war.297 The inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) stimulated a demand for "producers" goods because they were viewed as having relatively long income producing lives with these incomes tied to prices in the future (i.e., they were considered good inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedges). This market action is typical in high inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) environments. Similarly, it was widely recognized that short-term bank credits could be used to make long-term investments because, thanks to the increase of prices, the debtor could repay with depreciated money. It was thought that even if for the time being the new equipment was not utilized, it had an "intrinsic value". Similarly, at that time, the savings of entrepreneurs who readily adapted their behavior to make money went into tangible assets such as iron and stones. Also, to avoid the effects of the monetary depreciation, those in German agriculture continued to buy machines. The "flight from the mark to the machine", as it was called at the time, was one of the most convenient means of defense against the depreciation of the currency. Of course, those forms of investment were excessive and eventually did badly. For example, towards the end of the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), farmers realized that a great part of their capital was sunk in machines that were far more numerous than they needed.298

Those whose wealth was in fixed value monetary assets (e.g., bonds) and who did not learn to protect it by shifting into real assets or by contracting equivalent debts suffered devastating losses.

During the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), all companies, with rare exceptions, continually increased their capital299 by borrowing because one of the rules of good management during these inflationary times was to take on as much debt as possible because debts could be repaid with depreciated currency. At that time, smart investors were buyers of shares, firms, securities, and merchandise—i.e., they were buyers of tangible rather than financial wealth.300 So,

293 Bresciani-Turroni p. 188-197 294 Bresciani-Turroni p. 188-197 295 Bresciani-Turroni p. 188-197 296 Bresciani-Turroni p. 188-197 297 Holtfrerich p. 205 298 Bresciani-Turroni p. 188-197 299 Bresciani-Turroni p. 255 300 Bresciani-Turroni p. 294

there was a big shift by capitalists toward producing "goods for production" rather than "goods for consumption", and toward getting "short money" via borrowing. Of course, those who provided these goods demanded very high prices for them, so there was a more rapid increase in prices of producers' good than in those of consumers' goods.

Another reason for the high investment rates was to minimize taxes. By investing profits back in capital goods businesses could create expenses to lower their reported profits to escape onerous taxes.

At times of rapid depreciation of the mark, such as in the autumn of 1921, the stock market rose sharply.301 Speculation in stocks was popular as a currency/inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge, and became rampant at the time. A newspaper at the time wrote, "Today there is no one—from lift-boy, typist, and small landlord to the wealth lady in high society—who does not speculate in industrial securities and who does not study the list of official quotations as if it were a most precious letter."302

Because stocks were driven by the value of money/currency at the time (in 1920-1921), prices of industrial shares stopped being a good barometer of economic activity. In fact, the opposite was true—events which were unfavorable to Germany caused a fresh depreciation of the mark which caused a rise in the prices of industrial securities.303

From mid-1920 through the end of 1921 share prices responded to the fluctuations in the value of the currency304 and nearly tripled in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) adjusted terms. In the autumn of 1921, the mark collapsed and a fresh spurt in exports occurred.305

Then, in the first months of 1922, there was a relative stabilization of the mark. At the time, German exports were less than German imports. That is because exports consisted mainly of primary products, so when the exchange rate fell, the beneficial effects of increased exports were offset by the negative effects of rising import prices. So mark weakness hurt sectors such as food, drink and tobacco whose outputs were sold at home but whose raw material inputs were purchased abroad. Many people at the time believed that the real stimulus that arose from the mark's decline was from the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) that came substantially as a result of the fall in real interest rates306 that led to inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge buying.

Germany ran a large trade deficit between 1919 and 1922, though quantifying it is not possible for that period because of the difficulty of ascertaining correct gold-mark valuations of the trade flows. Still, we know that the deficit was big. Estimates vary from 4.5 to 11 billion gold marks which equaled 12% to 28% of GDP. On top of that deficit Germany had to come up with 2.6 billion gold marks worth of cash reparations payments, which equaled 6.7% of GDP. While a small surplus might have been earned on invisible account during those years (chiefly from tourism) it was very small, so the sum of the trade deficit plus reparations represents the order of magnitude of the current account deficit which appears to be somewhere between 11% and 17% of GDP!!307 Though we don't know what it was exactly, we know that it was huge.

How did this get funded? It was funded by foreign countries, mostly via individual investors who were lured by higher German interest rates. They accumulated substantial paper-mark claims on Germany throughout the 1914-1922 period. So Germany became a debtor to other countries' investors with the debt largely denominated in its own currency. The table below shows estimated Weimar Germany balance of payments numbers.

301 Bresciani-Turroni p. 256-7 302 Bresciani-Turroni p. 260 303 Bresciani-Turroni p. 260 304 Bresciani-Turroni p. 260 305 Bresciani-Turroni p. 229 306 Holtfrerich p. 203 307 Holtfrerich p. 283

It's estimated that foreigners transferred capital to Germany to the amount of 15.7 billion gold marks over the

period 1914-22 as a whole. J.M. Keynes and K. Singer estimated the unrequited resource transfer into Germany between 1919 and 1922 at between eight and ten billion gold marks. So Germany essentially borrowed money from private foreigners and in turn used the money it borrowed to pay foreign government reparations—so it was essentially a Ponzi scheme.308 While it looked like Germany was both making its reparation payments and providing investors with high returns, these payments came from borrowing money from foreigners. This is very much like the carry trade dynamic that was very popular in 2004-2007.

Foreigners also bought industrial or bank shares, houses, and, and in a lesser degree, land because prices were so low309 and the economy gave the appearance of being prosperous because it was relatively strong due to its large borrowings. So these capital flows helped to fill the gap.

As long as foreigners were willing to invest funds in marks, they also helped to keep the German currency from being weaker than it would have otherwise been. This was the case from February 1920 to May 1921, the period when the mark was fairly stable on the foreign exchanges despite a nearly fifty percent growth of the highpowered money stock. Between 1919 and 1923 Germany transferred 2.6 billion gold marks in cash to the Allies.

However, this ended up being only one third of what foreigners lost through the depreciation of their German bank balances.310 Foreign investors in Germany, especially in German debt, ended up losing huge amounts of money. For example, foreign (non-German) losses on debt due to depreciation were estimated at between seven and eight billion gold marks.311

In 1921 the average inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate was 140%, the real growth rate was 8.6%, M0 growth was 51% the mark fell by 163% and the real stock market rose by approximately 13% in US dollar terms and 75% relative to domestic prices.

# Hyperinflation January 1922- November 1923

## First Half of 1922: The Transition to Hyperinflation

*The stock market crashes; foreigners pull out of investments; mark depreciation accelerates; liquidity crisis; Reichsbank prints money and makes loans directly to the private sector…* 

In 1922, as the rate of price increases accelerated towards hyperinflation, there was a labor scarcity that drove the unemployment rate below one percent.

As inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) became hyperinflation, the currency weakness started to hurt the economy rather than to help it and stocks no longer seemed like a viable hedge against inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). Also, in January the allies imposed fiscal restraints on Germany. Instead of there being a high correlation between the exchange rate of the dollar and the price of shares, there was an increasing divergence between share prices and the exchange rate.

Foreigners pulled out in 1922, which caused a liquidity crisis, which led to the central bank to print the money to

ease the crisis, which led to an increase in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). This is a classic dynamic of debtor countries when they experience foreign capital withdrawals and economic weakness at the same time. In other words, when money leaves a country, (typically when foreign and domestic investors fear that they will lose money in debt instruments due to a credit crisis being accommodated by the central bank aggressively providing liquidity typically to fund growing budget deficits), the central bank is forced to choose between tighter money and printing money. As the economy is weak and credit is already tight, there really is no choice.312

As shown in the chart that follows, late in 1H22, the velocity of money accelerated, the mark depreciated, inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rose and M0 growth increased to accommodate this increased demand for cash.

In the spring of 1922, when foreigners' willingness to hold mark bank balances declined, this caused an acute liquidity crisis. Because such crises generally lead to bank and business collapses, in July 1922, the Reichsbank began to increase the supply of central bank money by stepping up its discounting of private bills. So the shift from inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) into hyper-inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) during 1922 was due to the decreased willingness of foreign and domestic investors to lend in marks, and the response of the central bank to replace this lost capital with printed currency

### At this point German investors were subjected to foreign exchange controls and legislation against capital flight.313

In January 1922, a deal was cut in which the Allies granted a reparations moratorium in exchange for a halt to Germany's printing of money and stabilizing its exchange rate. Consistent with this deal, increasing taxes and cutting expenditures were demanded as the means of balancing the Reich's budget. Also, the allies required that the Reichsbank be made autonomous, in the hope of stiffening its resistance to the Reich's demands for credit. The German side accepted these conditions.

After the ominous "Black Thursday" (December 1, 1921), shell shocked investors realized that not even the purchase of shares was a safe means of investing their savings, so stocks fell. By October 1922, the stock market index was at its lowest level since 1914.

The enormous drop in share prices that started in December 1921 caused stocks to become extremely cheap by late 1922. One example that is given is that all the share capital of Daimler was worth a value of 327 cars though it had "considerable plant and equipment, an extensive area of land, its reserves and its liquid capital, and its commercial organization developed in Germany and abroad."

In this 1921/1922 bear market, shareholders lost 75% on their investments. The table below shows equity shares against goods prices, conveying shareholders' real losses, even though nominal prices rose. As shown, the currency (i.e., mark) declined and wholesale prices increased by similar amounts, the total cost of living index rose by a bit less, shares rose by considerably less and M0 rose by even less. This reflects the fact that the increase in M0 was not the cause of the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and the currency depreciation, but rather was due to money supply being increased to accommodate the higher inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and currency depreciation. In other words, a selfreinforcing inflationary cycle developed in which the increased needs for money were accommodated by the central bank printing more, which led to currency weakness, higher inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and less capital going into credit, which created more demand for money, which the central bank accommodated.

In the period of relative stabilization of the exchange, which occurred in the first months of 1922, the recovery of the national finances made some progress as the German Government adopted some financial measures to reduce expenditures. But confidence in the mark, which the event of September 1921 had profoundly shaken, could not be re-established.

After June 1922, a new wave of pessimism swept over Germany. German speculation renewed its attacks against the mark, which once again suffered a sharp fall. The number of people who positioned themselves to

benefit from a continuous depreciation of the mark increased continually in Germany. Not only the great industries and the large merchant firms, but also numerous classes of investors, hoarded foreign bills or currency, which they bought with borrowed marks. Investors also wanted to escape the mark and the government's confiscatory taxes so anyone who had wealth invested it in foreign currencies, bills, securities, etc., which were easily concealed. The "flight of capital," which in Germany became a '"mass phenomenon" that restrictions did not succeed in stopping, continually removed a huge amount of taxable wealth from Germany. Producers protected themselves by forcing their customers to pay in foreign money, or to pay amounts in paper marks which were computed at the rate of the day on which the producer could convert them into foreign money. The retail trader at that time tried to protect himself by fixing a basic price in gold marks or dollars which he converted into paper marks at the daily rate.

# The disequilibrium between the demand and supply of foreign bills was the result of the following factors:

(a) Having little faith in the political and economic future of Germany and desiring to avoid taxes, German industrialists left abroad a part of the profits from exports; that is, the difference between the cost of production and the price which they received by selling abroad.

(b) A lot of the foreign money which was obtained by German sales to foreigners of securities, houses, land, etc., was either left abroad (the "flight of capital") or hoarded at home, so that it did not come on to the exchange market.

(c) The numerous laws that prohibited the buying of foreign exchange helped to lessen the supply of it because the possessor of foreign exchange would not give it up at any price, fearing that he would be unable to repurchase it later when the need arose.

(d) A brisk demand for foreign exchange on the part of the German possessors of paper marks. More and more, as the mark depreciated the phenomenon was understood by the public and the mark ceased to be wanted as a "store of value."

(e) As depreciation progressed, the mark became unfit as a medium of exchange. For example, the practice of calculating prices in foreign money became widespread in the second half of 1922 because it was more practical.

The chart below shows how the exchange rate's depreciation outpaced wholesale price increases, which outpaced the cost of living increases, which outpaced both M0 growth and stock price increases, from May 1922 through December 1922. As explained, that was because capital flows out of marks were accommodated by money growth in a self-reinforcing inflationary spiral—and not because money growth pushed prices higher.

The price movements of stocks are shown below. As shown by either measure, the real stock price fell by 80% to 90% from the end of the war in 1918 until mid-1920. Then inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) adjusted prices doubled to quadrupled (depending on which measure you use). Then inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) adjusted prices plunged to new lows in late 1922. Then in 1923, they rose by a factor of four or five. Imagine these whipsaws and what it must have been like to navigate through them.

It was clear that Germany's reparations debt needed to be restructured so a conference to explore how to do this occurred in Cannes in January 1922. The allies demanded that Germany stabilize its public finances by bringing its revenues and expenditures toward balance as the precondition for a reparations moratorium.314 Finally on March 9, 1922, a compromise was concluded between the parties and authorization was given to the Government to impose a forced loan of a billion gold marks. This was executed in July 1922, when the wealthy classes were forced to make a "loan" to the government. However, they secured the right to make this loan payable in paper marks because there was no other viable means of making payment. This scared investors who were afraid of having their wealth confiscated, and because this fiscal tightening would certainly hurt economic growth. This development hurt the stock market and briefly stabilized the mark between March and May 1922.315 For example, on the Berlin foreign exchange market the dollar exchange rate averaged 284.19 marks in March, 291.00 in April, 290.11 in May and, on June 9, 289.25. But it also caused businesses to suffer from illiquidity. The demands for bank credit increased as an attempt to raise liquidity by businesses. However, since at the same time the flow of funds to the banks fell, their own liquidity declined. At the same time the structure of their deposit liabilities shifted rapidly towards shorter term because depositors didn't want to grant longer term credit because they also were worried about their liquidity. So this increased bank liquidity risks. Banks in Germany were desperate for liquidity. In June, the Reparations Commission postponed consideration of loans to Germany until after a revision of reparations claims. That was the proverbial "straw that broke the camel's back"—i.e., it dashed hopes of an early stabilization of the mark which destroyed foreigners' willingness to accept payment in marks or to buy mark-denominated securities.316

Once foreigners were no longer prepared to buy German securities or real estate, and/or once the depreciation of the mark had so reduced the real value of these balances that they no longer mattered, this source of refinancing dried up. Then the choice was between extreme illiquidity and printing money at an accelerating rate, and the path was again obvious – i.e., to print. Then, since no one wanted to hold on to the currency in this rapidly depreciating inflationary environment, the velocity of money accelerated.317 A rapidly accelerating velocity with rapid growth in the money supply is a classic sign of an inflationary deleveraging. This point was reached in spring 1922. At this point the mark and domestic prices entered the hyperinflationary phase.

The economy's demand for credit intensified as price and cost increases accelerated and the central bank satisfied them by printing money as credit growth collapsed. In June and July 1922, the supply of bank credit reached a standstill as saving through this medium dried up. In fact, savings banks actually experienced a decline in the nominal value of their savings deposits during July as investors did not see savings deposits as a viable option. The Reichsbank tried to encourage commercial bills as a way of supplying business with the liquidity which it did by discounting such bills and by a propaganda campaign in the press.

With credit from banks no longer available to businesses, the Reichsbank was faced with the classic choice all central banks in this situation face—to either allow illiquidity to cause businesses to collapse or to allow businesses to have direct access to the central bank's credit facilities. The latter alternative was not necessarily more inflationary than the former because the central bank giving money to businesses directly wasn't much different from the central bank giving it to the banks to give to the businesses. And, there was no doubt that the liquidity had to be provided. In fact, since evidence of illiquidity intensified the domestic and foreign flight from the currency as investors wanted to run from default risks, it was argued that providing the liquidity to businesses directly (because the banks were ill-equipped to provide it) would help to stabilize the situation. At the time, the higher inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate raised government expenditures faster than tax revenues. As long as the rising domestic price level kept raising the paper mark value of government domestic expenditures, and as long as the falling exchange rate kept raising the paper mark value of reparations obligations, and as long as the Reichsbank continued to finance the Reich budget deficit without restraint, there was no liquidity crisis to have a counterinflationary effect, so the spiral accelerated.318

There was some talk about the allies relieving Germany of some of the reparations burden. But on June 10, 1922 the mark rate broke when the Reparations Commission chaired by J.P. Morgan made public its refusal to recommend long-term foreign lending to Germany until her reparation liabilities had been adjusted to her capacity to pay.319 Then depreciation turned into hyperinflation.

It was impossible to squeeze each year from the German people two billion gold marks, plus a sum equivalent to 26% of the value of exports,320 so something had to be done. The British representative on the Reparations Commission proposed something similar to the Brady Restructuring of debt in 1991—i.e., that the German government should make its payment in the form of treasury certificates with a five year term and the Allied governments should place these on the market, adding their own guarantee to them. In this way Germany would defer its 1923 and 1924 reparation payments for five years.321 In July 1922 reparation payments in foreign exchange were suspended. In spite of this, the depreciation of the German exchange continued.322

Second Half of 1922 *Liquidity crisis, Reichsbank policy, and monetary factors in the transition to hyperinflation…* 

The spiral accelerated in 2H1922. The sudden rise in prices caused an intense demand for cash. At the same time the government's need of money increased rapidly. Private banks, faced with withdrawals, found it practically impossible to meet the demand for money, so it had to ration the cashing of checks presented to them. On some days, they had to suspend payments or open their offices for a few hours only. Naturally this caused panic, especially among the industrial and commercial classes who were no longer in a position to fulfill their contracts because of their cash shortages. Private checks were refused because it became known that the banks would be unable to cash them. Business stopped. The panic spread to the working classes when they learned that their employers did not have the cash with which to pay their wages.323

As credit was non-existent, money had to be produced to replace it and, as rapid money growth caused inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), people didn't want to hold on to cash, so the velocity accelerated as cash was exchanged like a hot potato. As one economist on the time described it, "It was clear then that to stop the printing press would mean that in a very short time the entire public, and above all the Reich, could no longer pay merchants, employees, or workers. In a few weeks, besides the printing of notes, factories, mines, railways and post office, national and local government, in short, all national and economic life would be stopped."324

The government increased salaries in proportion to the depreciation of the mark, and employers in turn granted continual increases in wages, to avoid disputes, on the condition that they could raise the prices of their products. As is normal in such cases of prices and wage indexing, a vicious circle was established: the exchange depreciated; internal prices rose; note-issues were increased; the increase of the quantity of paper money lowered once more the value of the mark in terms of gold; prices rose once more; and so on.325

Meanwhile, banks continued to have a shortage of cash to meet withdrawals.326

However, as alternative forms of money emerged, and the velocity of money accelerated, the real supply of money fell. Towards the end of 1922 this real value of currency in circulation had become less than the value of the gold reserve of the Reichsbank. Similarly, in certain other countries, where the legal currency in circulation fell to very low levels, the gold cover of the notes (the gold being valued according to the foreign exchange), was much greater than in countries where the currency depreciation had not gone to such lengths.

During 1922, the management of the Reichsbank tenaciously refused to allow the gold reserve to be used for monetary reform.327 Throughout this period the Reichsbank continued to finance government deficits by accepting Reich treasury bills. In fact, as the demand for Treasury bills shrank, the percentage held outside the Reichsbank fell, signaling the final failures of all credit instruments as a storehold of wealth, hence the hyperinflation.328

The chart below shows how the role of private banks fell from 1920 to 1923 as banks were faced with liquidity problems and the Reichsbank replaced it by lending directly. Until the summer of 1922 the Reichsbank exercised, almost exclusively, the function of a State bank, discounting Treasury bills presented to it. The increasing needs of trade were satisfied by private banks which could discount directly at the Reichsbank the Treasury bills in which they had largely invested the money of depositors during and after the war.329

As mentioned. in July of 1922 the Reichsbank began to supply liquidity to businesses-i.e .. the Reichsbank allowed big businesses to borrow via commercial bills. which the Reichsbank discounted at a much lower rate than the rate of the depreciation of the mark and even lower than the rates charged by private banks. so essentially a subsidized rate. As a result, these companies could borrow on terms that were essentially the same as the Reich. They even had direct access to the Reichsbank. These moves were quite similar to recent moves by the Fed and motivated by similar reasons.

The official discount rate in Germany remained fixed at 5% from 1915 until July 1922, so as inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rose, real interest rates fell to very negative levels. The discount rate was raised to 6% at the end of July, to 7% at the end of August, to 8% on September 21, to 10% on November 13, to 12% on January 18, 1923, and to 18% in the last week of April 1923. However, these rates of interest were still all much less than the rate of depreciation in the value of money so they didn't dissuade the borrowing and other shorting of marks. So inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge assets and other currencies continued to rise. For example, a gold mark was worth 160 paper marks at the end of July 1922, 411 paper marks at the end of August, 1,822 at the end of November, and 7,100 at the end of April 1923.**<sup>330</sup>** However, as conveyed in the following chart, these increases in interest rates were the beginning of a major increase in rates that occurred in 1923.

While the liquidity of the banking system was high during the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) since money itself was generally so plentiful, in 1922 this changed when a crisis of liquidity at the banks accompanied hyperinflation. See the table that follows. Note how deposits as a percent of the monetary base fell sharply and continuously at banks except for the Joint Stock banks in Berlin.

## As inflation worsened, bank depositors understandably wanted to be able to get their funds on short notice so they shortened their lending to banks. This is reflected in the following tables331 which show how over 90% of bank deposits were for seven days or less in 1922-1923 and how over 80% of deposits moved to short-term checking accounts rather than longer-term savings. During inflationary deleveragings, average maturities of debt always fall, so this is typical.

Also, because it had become impractical to transact in marks, foreign currency (especially dollars) replaced the mark as the means of settlement of large transactions, though small transactions continued to be in marks. The economic situation in October 1922, was described by the newspaper *Frankfurter Zeitung*: "German economic life is now dominated by a struggle over the survival of the mark: is it to remain the German currency, or is it doomed to extinction? During the past few months foreign currencies have replaced it as units of account in domestic transactions to a wholly unforeseen extent. The habit of reckoning in dollars, especially, has established itself, not only in firms' internal accounting practice, but above all as the method of price quotation in trade, industry and agriculture."332 This discussion of the prospects for the mark concludes by emphasizing the degree to which foreign currencies also served as "stores of value", used to protect the real value of money balances.

On October 12, 1922, strictly enforced limits were put on FX purchases making transactions impractical, essentially eliminating foreign currencies as an alternative. Investors who were investing their available resources in foreign exchange to escape inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) once again had to turn to the share market. The shift from foreign money to stocks arising from the decree of October 12 was obvious in that it caused a heavy fall in the supply of foreign exchange333 and a rise in stock prices suddenly in the second half of October. This dynamic was similar to the frenzied bull speculation in the autumn of 1921.

One of the most important drivers of hyperinflation in the second half of 1922 was wage indexation because it produced a wage-cost spiral. In the second half of 1922, the resistance of the workers to reductions in their real wages increased. The working classes sought to re-establish the earlier level of real wages and to keep them stable, so wages were often indexed to inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). As a result, the profits which entrepreneurs334 derived from real wages falling evaporated. As the chart below shows, the real wage declines that occurred in 1921 to late 1922, ended in late 1922 at levels that were down 50% to 75% from pre-war levels, and shot up in 1923.

While the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) had a devastating effect on the wealth of debt and equity holders and it slashed real wages to workers, it generally helped agile entrepreneurs and the owners of material means of production and strengthened the positions of industrial capitalists.335 But it was terrible for productivity. For example, the entrepreneur, instead of concentrating his attention on improving the product and reducing his costs often became a speculator in goods and foreign exchanges.

## 1923 The Occupation of the Ruhr

To make matters worse, on January 11, 1923 France and Belgium occupied Germany's Ruhr valley to capture the

German coal, iron and steel production in the Ruhr area. This was supposedly done to gain the money that Germany owed in reparations. France had the iron ore and Germany had coal to make steel, so there had been a history of tensions related to their trade that exacerbated the problem. This aggressive act was a classic case of a debtor/creditor/trading relationship turning antagonistic. This occupation caused the stock market and the currency to plunge. But the currency plunge and the hyper-inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) became so severe that they drove nominal stock prices up. The stock index number of shares increased from 8,981 in December 1922 to 22,400 in January

## 1923, and to 45,200 in February.336 It's a good example of how a bearish development can be so negative for a country's currency that it can cause nominal stock prices to rise.

A pause in the mark's decline occurred when the Reichsbank began its policy of supporting the mark by imposing an artificial exchange rate that linked the mark to the dollar.337 It did this by issuing its first dollar-denominated treasury certificates. The dollars raised were to be employed by the Reichsbank in an attempt to stabilize the exchange rate. The Reichsbank pledged abroad a good part of the one billion gold marks' worth of gold reserves with which it had started 1923 in order to obtain the requisite foreign exchange for the support action. This "stabilization action" succeeded between February and April. But that policy finished unsuccessfully, as all fixed exchange rates that are pegged inconsistent with the fundamentals inevitably do. That is because the Reich's floating debt rose from 2.1 to 6.6 trillion marks between the end of January and March and the acquiring of further foreign credits reduced Germany's gold reserves to under 500 million gold marks (by the end of 1923). German also had silver stocks—which were not explicitly shown in the Bank's Statements—largely lost in the same period. So in the second half of April 1923, the mark fell again.

It was estimated that this early 1923 failed currency defense cost more than three hundred million gold marks. This defense was abandoned and the dollar rate soared.

There was also a very big redistribution of wealth, from high income earners to low income earners. The next table shows how the distribution of wealth shifted from 1913 to 1923. It conveys that it was not the middle income earners and moderate wealth holders who were affected the most severely by the postwar redistributive processes; it was exclusively the upper income groups. Their losses had less to do with taxes (which did have an adverse affect because they were based on the individual's ability to pay) than with the effect of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) on the value of the capital assets the wealthy held to store their wealth. The table and charts below show this redistribution of wealth.

Of course, all holders of financial wealth suffered, in varying degrees. The table that follows shows estimates of how much by wealth category.

The first table above indicates that at December 31, 1923, taxable wealth was more equally distributed than it had been ten years earlier. It also shows that the two lowest wealth classes virtually doubled their share of aggregate wealth, the middle categories increased their share of the total, and the classes above these fell. The second table also indicates that over this ten year period the aggregate value of wealth declined by 61.2%, which was much greater than the 25-30% fall in real national income between 1913 and 1923. That is because (a) the income from capital and (b) the value of capital became a smaller proportion of national income.

The period of most acute and widespread poverty was 1923. Not coincidently, it was also the year of the highest crime rate. Plunderings and riots became common. To cope with the social unrest which the collapse of the mark had caused, the Reich declared a state of siege on September 27, 1923.338

By mid-1923, people were eager for some cash-like vehicle to hold their liquidity in. New forms of credit were invented and desperation made some of them work. In the summer of 1923, when the scarcity of money was most acute, the Berlin banks decided to issue a kind of check which was to be acceptable at their branches and which was also willingly accepted by the public, who were desirous of having any means of payment whatever.

Private firms, industrial companies, combines, and public authorities issued all kinds of provisional money. This was very similar to what happened in other inflationary deleveragings like when the banks became dysfunctional such as in Argentina.

In August 1923, the value of foreign currencies employed in transactions within Germany was almost ten times as great as the value of the paper-mark circulation.339 So the currency was essentially defunct and all debt denominated in it was extinguished—i.e., marks no longer served a meaningful purpose of either a medium of exchange and as a store of wealth.

In an attempt to satisfy the desperate demand for value-maintaining means of payment, the Reich brought out a five hundred million gold mark loan in August 1923. It was issued in notes of small denomination so that they could be used as means of payment. To support the value of these, the Reich also issued exchange-rate linked treasury certificates—i.e., certificates whose value was effectively denominated in dollars pegged to the dollar exchange rate. The Reich also permitted provinces, municipalities, chambers of commerce and large business firms to issue emergency money denominated in gold marks. Also, some companies borrowed by issuing "loans at a stable value" which were tied to what they produced—e.g., rye farmers issue rye-backed debt.

Because it was impossible to do accounting for, and convey the meaning of, money because its value changed so fast, the accounting system was changed and the practice of valuing things in gold became generally adopted.

#### Naturally, there was the almost complete disappearance of bankruptcies in the advanced phases of the inflationary monetary depreciation because debts were easily paid off with paper money.

During the hyperinflation the prices of equity shares generally were determined by investors on the basis of the "intrinsic value" of the companies rather than as multiples on earnings. In the last phase of the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) (i.e. in 1923), there was a tendency to overvalue shares. Then, after the stabilization of the mark, the prices of shares declined rapidly. The average quotation for December 1923 was 26.9 (1913 = 100).

## *Final Stages of Inflation…*

In the summer of 1923, when the mark was losing value rapidly everybody tried to get rid of marks as soon as they received them. They also tried to short them by borrowing them and converting them into foreign exchange and hard assets. The increase in the velocity of the money in circulation was the expression of the fact that the population lived from day to day without keeping any cash reserves. For example, in Germany it was rare for a retailer or workman to have cash balances that were greater than necessary for two or three days' needs.340 The risk of transactions affected by payment in paper marks became so great in the summer of 1923 that many producers and merchants preferred not to sell at all rather than to accept money for goods. Some just made their prices so high that people refused to buy the merchandise. In fact, prices in October and November of 1923 were so high that a stoppage of sales was the norm. Business and great shops were deserted. As a result, the personnel who worked in these stores were let go or given less work hours. The drop in sales resulted in a fall in working capital, so production ceased and unemployment increased.

The depreciation of the currency in the early stages stimulated production, but in the late phase it acted as a serious obstacle to production because of the chaos it caused. When the currency depreciation and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) caused economic collapse instead of economic support, stabilization of the currency became essential.

Ironically, because of both the acceleration in the velocity of money and because it became dysfunctional as a medium of exchange, in August 1923 the value of the paper money in circulation declined to scarcely 80 million gold marks.341 By this time, the total circulation of "value-maintaining paper money" had grown in excess of the value of paper marks and of various non-value-maintaining moneys in circulation during the final phase of the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).

In the summer of 1923, the price of the dollar jumped in the course of a few days to 1, 2, and then 5 million paper marks.342 In the days preceding the monetary reform the official quotations of the dollar at Berlin were as follows:

In the black foreign market the dollar reached much higher rates. The rates were more than double these levels.

The table that follows shows indices for internal prices, imported prices, currency in circulation, floating rate debt outstanding, and the mark/dollar exchange rate. We put it in the table form because it is difficult to read in chart form. As shown, the exchange rate changed the most and changes in it typically led to changes in other things.

Note that in the 1921-23 hyperinflation upswing, the mark's decline led the increase in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and the increase in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) led the increase in M0 growth.

The evidence shows that the cause of this hyperinflation was described at the time. The following are good descriptions of this dynamic:

#### Helfferich (economist)

"The depreciation of the German mark in terms of foreign currencies was caused by the excessive burdens thrust on to Germany and by the policy of violence adopted by France; the increase of the prices of all imported goods was caused by the depreciation of the exchanges; then followed the general increase of internal prices and of wages, the increased need for means of circulation on the part of the public and of the State, greater demands on the Reichsbank by private business and the State and the increase of the paper mark issues. Contrary to the widely held conception, *not inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) but the depreciation of the mark was the beginning of this chain of cause and effect*; inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) is not the cause of the increase of prices and of the depreciation of the mark; but the depreciation of the mark is the cause of the increase of prices and of the paper mark issues. The decomposition of the German monetary system has been the primary and decisive cause of the financial collapse."343

#### 'Authoritative Writer' from German Press

![](Attachments/EconomicMachine_page_34_Figure_1.jpeg)

*Source: Global Financial Data, BW Estimates* 

"Since the summer of 1921 the foreign exchange rate has lost all connection with the internal inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). The increase of the floating debt, which represents the creation by the State of new purchasing-power, follows at some distance the depreciation of the mark…Furthermore, the level of internal prices is not determined by the paper inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) or credit inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), but exclusively by the depreciation of the mark in terms of foreign currencies…To tell the truth, the astonishing thing is not the great quantity but the small quantity of money which circulates in Germany, a quantity extraordinarily small from a relative point of view; even more surprising is it that the floating debt has not increased much more rapidly."344

#### Government Report

"The fundamental cause of the dislocation of the German monetary system is the disequilibrium of the balance of payments. The disturbance of the national finances and the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) are in their turn the consequences of the depreciation of the currency. The depreciation of the currency upset the Budget balance, and determined with an *inevitable necessity* a divergence between income and expenditure, which provoked the upheaval."

<sup>343</sup> Bresciani-Turroni p. 42-5 344 Bresciani-Turroni p. 42-5

Our examinations of other cases of hyperinflationary periods show that these causes are typical—i.e., that countries with large debts, especially large foreign debts, high dependencies on foreign capital, credit problems and large and growing budget deficits, are much more prone to experience capital flight and currency depreciation, faster monetary base growth, and high inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rates than countries with balance of payments surpluses.345

# Stabilization: From Late 1923 Onward

Now that we've seen how this inflationary deleveraging came about, let's see how it was extinguished. By late 1923 virtually all debts were extinguished by inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), and there was a great deal of betting on inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and being short the mark.

Starting in August 1923 there was a feverish attempt to devise a new currency or stabilize the old one. The plans for stabilizing the currency fell into three groups.

(1) Plans to use taxation policy, a ban on credit, and restrictions on foreign-currency holdings.

Along these lines, in August 1923 the government introduced an "index-linked" tax assessment, it issued "value-maintaining loans", it sought to acquire foreign-currency holdings, and it urged banks and the Reichsbank to offer their clients gold-mark accounts, i.e., accounts in which the borrower promises to calculate the value based on the price of gold.

(2) Plans to return to a gold currency.

(3) Plans to secure the currency by mortgaging of land or commodities.346

On August 14, 1923, the government passed a law that created a Gold Loan of 500 million gold marks. This law contained only this promise: "In order to guarantee the payment of interest and the redemption of the loan of 500 million gold marks, the Government of the Reich is authorized, if the ordinary receipts do not provide sufficient cover, to raise supplements to the tax on capital…" The word "wert-bestandig" which meant "stablevalue" was written on the new paper money. And the public accepted and hoarded these notes. In other word, the gold loans seemed to be believed and thus created a vehicle for financial savings. The German monetary law of August 30, 1924, fixed the conversion rate of the new Reichsmark (whose weight in fine gold was equal to that of the old mark) at *one trillion* paper marks.347

Creating a new currency with very hard backing, and phasing out the old currency, is the most classic path that countries that are suffering from inflationary deleveragings follow in order to end them. On October 15, a decree was issued which instituted a new money, the rentenmark, to begin from November 15, 1923. The key was to issue very little of it and to have it be backed by gold. At this time the money supply was so reduced by the abandonment of marks—e.g., the total amount of floating debt was only 200 million gold marks—that creating a real backing was possible. Towards the end of October 1923 the total sum of paper marks issued in Germany equaled scarcely 150 million gold marks, so they were essentially out of circulation. Going to new currencies with hard currency on gold backings is a classic step in inflationary deleveragings to bring about stability. The chart below shows the monetary base in dollars fell to equal Germany's gold reserves in dollars in 1923.

<sup>345</sup> Bresciani-Turroni p. 42-5 346 Holtfrerich p. 314 347 Bresciani-Turroni p. 344-5

The government chose to make the gold value of the new currency identical to that of the prewar mark. Also the government imposed a credit limit of 1.2 billion marks on the new bank's dealings with the private sector—not least in order not to make the Reichsbank wholly redundant—and it reduced the ceiling on credit to the Reich to 1.2 billion marks as well. The "Currency Bank" became the "Rentenbank" and the "rye mark" became the "rentenmark".348 The "rentenmark experiment"—i.e., this move to a new, gold-backed currency—met with astounding success. Since the new currency was identical to the former national gold currency, and the government did almost everything in its power to ensure that its value remained stable, it maintained its value. The new currency was almost completely stable from the outset.

The old currency lost its value and the disappeared. The dollar was worth 160,000 paper marks on July 3, 1923, on the Berlin Bourse, 13 million on September 4, and 420 billion on November 20. From then onwards the exchange rate of the dollar remained stable; so also did the ratio of the value between the new rentenmark and the dollar (1 dollar – 4.2 rentenmarks). During 1924 the German and Austrian exchanges were the most stable in Europe.349

It was not the decree of the October 15, 1923, but the monetary law of August 30, 1924 (which became effective on October 11, 1924) which sanctioned the legal reduction of the value of the paper mark.350

"The miracle of the rentenmark" became a common expression because the improvement occurred so rapidly that people could not easily find an explanation for it.351

Some economists attribute the success of the German monetary reform to discontinuing the issuance of paper marks, strict limitations of the quantity of the new money, and the calling-in of paper marks in proportion to the

issues of new money. Also, on November 16 the discounting of Treasury bills by the Reichsbank was stopped.

However, the issuing of paper money for commercial purposes continued after November 16. At that date the quantity of paper marks in circulation amount to 93 million trillion. By November 30 it had already passed 400 million trillion, it reached 496 million trillion on December 31, 690 million trillion on March 31, 1924, 927 million trillion on May 31, and 1,211 million trillion on July 31. At the same time the issues of new rentenmarks increased,

<sup>348</sup> Holtfrerich p.316 349 Bresciani-Turroni p. 334-5 350 Bresciani-Turroni p. 334-5 351 Bresciani-Turroni p. 336-7

## and their circulation amounted to 501 million on November 30, 1923, 1,049 million on December 31, 1,760 million on March 31, 1924, and 1,803 million on July 31.352

So the introduction of the new currency rentenmark occurred with old marks still in circulation so it was accompanied "by the most colossal monetary inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) ever recorded in the history of the world" in old-mark terms, while the rentenmark was stable. This currency stability might have been due to other countries experiencing similar rapid increases in their money supplies.353

Of course, with the abandonment of the old currency, accounting laws had to be changed. On December 28, 1923, a decree compelled industrial companies to compile new balance sheets, valuing their assets and liabilities in "gold marks". With 500 rentenmarks one could obtain at any moment a bond with the nominal value of 500 gold marks, which was guaranteed by a legal mortgage on German property and which yielded a rate of interest at 5 percent in gold (actually payable in paper at the exchange rate of the gold mark.)354

Of course, the stability of the value of the rentenmark could not have been due to the possibility of converting the currency into mortgage securities because, at the time, the market value of the mortgage bonds was lower than the nominal value and the market rate of interest was much higher than 5 percent. During 1924 the prices of "stable-value loans" yielded an effective interest of as much as 15-20%. And of course, issuing more rentenmarks would add to the Government's burden on interest on mortgage bonds, for which the public would exchange increasing quantities of rentenmarks.355 However, as shown in the chart on page 26, interest rates were raised dramatically which changed the economics of borrowing and lending in marks. The lack of confidence in the paper mark gradually lessened and, as a result, consumers, producers, and merchants ceased to be preoccupied with the necessity of reducing their holdings of paper marks to a minimum. As a result, after the stabilization of the mark exchange in November 1923, the velocity of paper mark circulation declined. In other words, the money supply could rise and velocity could drop because of increased confidence in marks for saving.

At the same time the Reichsbank energetically set about eliminating the illegal emergency monies from circulation. The government also fixed wages.356

As the mark gained credibility as a medium of exchange, foreign currencies were turned in for it. This showed up in the balance sheets of the Reichsbank, which showed a continuous and noticeable rise in the item "other assets," in which, as experts know, was that foreign exchange. According to the balance sheets of the Reichsbank, "other assets" amounted to 18.8 million gold marks on November 15, 1923, 285.8 million on January 7, 1924, 702.3 million on June 30, and 1,183 million on October 31, 1924.357 It also appears that those who were short it in various forms got squeezed, adding to the upward pressure on it.

Nonetheless, the stability of the German exchange rate gave way in February and March 1924 as the credit policy of the Reichsbank was not strict enough, and symptoms of a new "inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md)" appeared in the first quarter of 1924.358 However, on April 7, 1924, the Reichsbank, now convinced that it was heading for a fresh inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), which would cause a new depreciation of the paper mark and the rentenmark, decided to restrict credit severely, which worked. The shortage of marks caused a supply of hoarded foreign exchange to come to the market for sale for marks. At the same time the demand for foreign exchange on the Berlin Bourse declined considerably.359

# The decree of February 14, 1924, "revalued" some debts i.e., required debtors to give creditors more than their

face value. For example, debentures and mortgages were revalued at about 15 percent of their original gold value. Mortgage bonds, savings bank deposits, and obligations arising from life assurance contracts were revalued at a rate corresponding to the revaluation of mortgages and other claims held by the Land Credits Institute, assurance companies, and savings banks.

The decree of February 14, 1924, was a good concept but it ran into some problems in application. Creditors had lost virtually all value to inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) and were angry about how their trust was abused, and the government wanted to renew the rewards for lending, which was the intention of this plan. Creditors induced the German Government to announce a new plan which became law on July 16, 1925. The chief provisions of the new law were as follows: (a) The normal rate of revaluation of mortgages was raised to 25% of the original gold value, (b) the law applied to extinct mortgages, if the creditor had accepted the reimbursement with a reservation, (c) for mortgages taken up after June 15, 1922, the law had retroactive effect even if the reimbursement had been accepted without reservation, (d) the payment of sums due on the basis of this law could be demanded after January 1, 1932: in the meantime debtors paid interest at 1.2% after January 1, 1925, 2.5% after July 1, 1925, 3% after January 1, 1926, and 5% after January 1, 1928, (e) the debtor could obtain a reduction in the rate of revaluation to 15% in cases of straitened economic conditions.md), (f) those who had bought industrial debentures before July 1, 1920, received (besides 15% of the gold value of the security) a small share in the dividends of the company, (g) for securities taken up after January 1, 1918, there was used, as a coefficient for the transformation from paper value to gold value, an average between the dollar exchange rate and the index number of wholesale prices. Just as debt reductions have the effect of easing credit, weakening the currency and increasing inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) (or lessening deflation), debt revaluations tighten credit, support currencies and lower inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).360

Under the Loan Redemption Act that came into force on the same day, July 16, 1925, as the Revaluation Act, certain holders of public bonds gained a revaluation, as they had not under the Third Emergency Tax Decree.361

Throughout 1924, the supply and demand for foreign exchange were largely dependent on the credit policy of the Reichsbank. The connection between the abundance of credit and the depreciation of the exchange rate in the first quarter of 1924, which was followed by the tightening of credit and strengthening of the mark in the succeeding months, was obvious and confirmed the ideas of the Quantity Theory.

## On October 15, 1923, the German government took the step of completely suspending loans for "Passive Resistance". These excessively generous subsidies, which were granted by the German government, were the principal cause of the enormous deficit in 1923, so eliminating them reduced the budget deficit. Also in the autumn of 1923, the German government tried to free the budget temporarily from the burden of reparations by putting the burden on to private industry. On November 23, 1923, the "Micum" (Mission Interalliée de Controle des Usines et des Mines) and the leading heavy industries concluded an agreement about the supply of coal on reparations account.362 This fiscal tightening also supported the currency and helped to reduce inflation.

Control over the foreign exchange market was gradually relaxed—e.g., the "Foreign Exchange Commissioner" ceased to function. However, certain restrictions (based on the decrees of October 31 and of November 8, 1924) remained. They (a) specified the process for making foreign payments (which had to be done through an authorized bank), (b) prohibited forward contracts in foreign exchange (c) prohibited the buying or selling of foreign exchange at a higher rate than the official rate in Berlin, and (d) required banks to furnish the authorities with information on foreign exchange business concluded in their own names or for a third party.

Whenever the Rentenbank gave direct loans, it imposed the so-called "constant value clause" which required the borrower to repay them in gold marks.

According to a new law that was passed August 30, 1924, and effective on October 11, 1924, a new German currency called the "reichsmark" was created. Its value was set at 1 reichsmark = 1 trillion paper marks, and 1 reichsmark = 1 rentenmark. The old paper mark was then completely withdrawn from circulation and ceased to be legal tender on June 5, 1925. The transition to a stable German currency was complete.

The gold content of the reichsmark was the same as that which was fixed for the old mark set on March 14, 1875 (1,392 marks = 500 grams of fine gold). The system established after November 1923 continued, so the old notes circulated internally but remained unconvertible. Through this process, the German monetary system was essentially on a dollar exchange standard.363

The Reich budget was quickly balanced to everyone's amazement. This occurred via: (a) the strict cutting down of expenses, and (b) the introduction of new taxes and the revaluation of existing taxes and tariffs. The expenses of civil administration were reduced by dismissing a great number of employees. The laws passed on October 15 and November 23 that were previously mentioned had a big effect. But other moves also helped. In Germany, after the war, the heaviest item in the Reich expenditure was the service of public loans. Of the 17.5 billion marks estimated expenditure for the financial year 1919, interest on loans of the Reich represented a good 10 billion. But the monetary depreciation caused the pre-war debt and debts contracted during and after the war to disappear almost completely. To deal with this, the consolidated debt of the Reich (58.5 billion gold marks) was entirely annulled, and the floating debt in paper marks, which amounted to 197 trillion paper marks on November 15, 1923 was paid by the transfer to the Reichsbank of 197 million rentenmarks lent by the Rentenbank with the Reich not paying any interest on this.364

Once the exchange rate was stabilized, the yield of taxes increased rapidly primarily because of increased tax revenue arising from the economy's improvement. Tax revenues rose from 14.5 million gold marks in October 1923 to 63.2 millions in November, 312.3 millions in December 1923, and to 503.5 millions in January 1924. Thanks to this marked increase in receipts and controls on spending, the budget was balanced in January 1924, for the first time since the outbreak of the war.365

One of the common characteristics of countries that stabilized their currencies and controlled their inflations after an extended period of rampant inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) has been a lack of working capital and a high rate of interest.366 That set of circumstances existed in Germany through most of 1924.

Until August 23, 1926, the Reichsbank kept the exchange rate of the dollar steady in German marks. In the financial year 1924-25, there was a considerable surplus of receipts over expenses.

During the years between 1925 and the financial crisis of 1931 the fluctuating amounts of foreign loans were the main driver in determining the value of the mark in terms of other currencies. For long periods, the persistent supply of foreign exchange arising from long or short-term loans had the effect of maintaining an exchange rate favorable to Germany. Also, the Reichsbank was able to replenish its gold reserves rapidly.

Through numerous banks that were created by the Reich itself, funds which had accumulated in the Reich or State Treasuries were lent to German business generally as short-term loans, though the Reich and States often granted special long-term loans to industry and agriculture. The government also invested money in the purchase of firms and industrial shares.

Also, tightening credit to make it profitable to be long the currency and painful to be short it is a classic means of stabilizing the currency and lowering inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md). This happened in Germany at the time. While interest rates rose slower than inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) early in the upswing in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), interest rates rose faster than inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) at the end. In December 1923, complete confidence in German money was not yet re-established and the premium for the risk of depreciation remained high. According to the statements of a well-known banker, the interest rate on overnight paper mark loans in December 1923 was typically not lower than 3-5% per month. On the other hand, for rentenmark loans (which had a clause that guaranteed the lender against the risk of the depreciation of the rentenmark itself), interest was 1-1.5% per month. This interest rate shows that the guarantee was given some credence (which is why the interest rate was lower than the paper mark rate), but not discounted as being certain (which is why the rate was still high). During 1924, the highest rates of interest occurred in April and May. Interest rates rose to very high levels that produced a high premium relative to the expected future depreciation of the currency.367

This tightening was reflected in the divergence between the official discount rate and the market rate. In normal times the market rate was lower than the rate fixed by the Reichsbank, but in 1924 the situation was reversed368 because money was so tight. After the stabilization of the mark and the monetary reform of November 1923, the shortage of capital became really serious causing those who had bet on the mark's depreciation to be squeezed. For example, those who borrowed marks to buy inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge assets were squeezed as borrowing costs and the mark rose at the same time as the prices of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge assets fell.369

While in late 1923 inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) was practically the only form of taxation and it weighed almost exclusively on capitalists, workers, and private and Government salaried employees, after stabilization that all changed. Those penalized by the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) benefited and high direct taxes became effective.

As the profits from inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) disappeared, the tremendous waste of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedge activities became apparent and those who engaged in them lost a lot. Numerous entrepreneurs who had bought firms with debt lost everything when the currency was stabilized.370 Due to the insufficiency of working capital and the fall in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) hedging activities, industries reduced their demands for instruments of production to free up working capital. For example, during the period of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), there was the accumulation of stocks of unsold coal and iron, but after it subsided, these were dumped at losses. "The prosperity of the industries consuming coal, which had been dependent on the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), caused rapid development of all the mines,"371 but with the stabilization now in place, the mining industry found itself heavily burdened with very small or negative returns, and those that produced coal of poor quality found that it was no longer saleable. Between the end of 1923 and October 1925, 63 mines in the Ruhr area were closed.372 One report at the time described the situation as follows: "We have some very extensive factories which are nothing but *rubbish*. It is not sufficient, if we wish to restore our business, to close these establishments, in the hope of reopening them later. Even factories not working cost money…Therefore our slogan must be: Demolition!" It was estimated that three quarters of the existing plant in shipyards was useless. More than a hundred thousand bank employees were discharged during 1924 and 1925.373

On the other hand, goods for direct consumption were very scarce at the beginning of 1924. While the industries producing instruments of production and raw materials were in a crisis, broadly speaking, industries that produced goods for direct consumption, or the raw materials especially used by these industries did well. During 1925, the deleveraging of share prices was especially marked for the mining and iron and steel industries, and for some branches of the engineering trade such as that of making railway goods. It was felt less by industries that produced direct consumption goods, such as textiles and beer. Stocks fell, especially in industries that did relatively well in inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md).374

One of the immediate and most typical consequences of the monetary stabilization was the sudden rise in the purchasing power of the working class. While rent controls and inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) had made the working class' expenditures on rent practically disappear by 1923, after the stabilization rents were raised rapidly. As rents rose, it became economic to build houses to rent out, and for those who had rented to own instead. While during the period of inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) the building trade was practically limited to the building of mansions for the newly rich who were profiting from the monetary depreciation, in 1924 there was a revival of the building of houses for the working and middle classes.375

The chart below shows how housing construction accelerated started in 1924.

As shown below, this boom in housing continued until the bubble burst in 1929 and the 1930's deleveraging began.

Labor productivity also increased rapidly after stabilization. For example, it was reported that in June 1926 in the Ruhr coal area, 389,037 employees produced more coal, and of better quality, than was produced by 581,054 in 1923.376

# There was a big increase in wages in the first months of 1924 as wage restrictions were lifted and there was a reaction against the excessively low wages which had been fixed at the beginning of the monetary stabilization.

During 1924 the big increase in the average income of workers was the combined effect of the rise in wage-rates and the fall in unemployment. But from 1925 to 1928 the general movement of workers' incomes was principally influenced by the rise in wage-rates rather than increased employment. For example, while in June 1925 the monthly unemployment rate was 4.6% of the members of trade unions and the index of workers incomes was 110.8, in June 1928 the percentage of unemployed was 7.5%377 and the index of workers' incomes rose to 124.

As domestic money and credit was tight and there was a need for it, the German industrialists drew on their reserves of foreign exchange, which they had deposited in foreign banks during the depreciation of the mark. Besides helping to stabilize the mark and contain inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md), it supported business activity.

Both the government and the Director of the Reichsbank agreed that the stabilization of the value of the currency was a necessity which should have precedence over any other matter.378

As a result of this stable currency policy, German foreign trade in 1924 and 1925 was characterized by an enormous increase in imports of food and unprocessed goods, while there was no growth in manufactured goods imports (see below). In 1924 and 1925, exports remained stationary.379

Though I will not continue this chronology beyond 1925, I have included the following charts to convey the picture of what happened in Germany into the Great Depression in 1932. As the previous chronology of the Great Depression includes a description of Germany until 1938, those who are interested in how this operatic drama continued through then can pick up the story there. The charts below show (1) the nominal and real stock prices, (2) the mark/dollar exchange rate and the price of gold in marks, (3) the inflation/War%20Economies%20and%20Hyperinflation.md) rate and changes in M0, and (4) the growth rate of industrial production from 1923 through 1932.
