# Introduction & Big Ideas Silicon Valley Bank  

Lecture 1 Thomas S. Coleman March 20th, Draft March 19, 2023  

# The Power & Value of Finance  

A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power . . . But the same sum scattered in tens and ﬁfties through a whole nation is no power at all (Walter Bagehot 1873)  

The Economist  correctly claims that ﬁnance is one of mankind’s greatest inventions:  

What is mankind’s greatest invention? ... [People] are unlikely to suggest ... the ﬁnancial contract. Widely disliked and often considered grubby, it has nonetheless played an indispensable role in human development for at least 7,000 years.  

... ﬁnance ... can act as an economic time machine, helping savers transport today’s surplus income into the future, or giving borrowers access to future earnings now. (2017)  

Finance: re-arranging money & resources (cash ﬂows) across time & people • We see power of ﬁnance when it goes wrong: crises like 2008  

Finance is about money and resources, and re-arranging cash ﬂows across time and across people. Walter Bagehot understood the power of ﬁnance:  

A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power . . . But the same sum scattered in tens and ﬁfties through a whole nation is no power at all ([ ? ], Lombard Street 1873)  

and  The Economist  correctly claims that ﬁnance is one of mankind’s greatest inventions:  

What is mankind’s greatest invention? Ask people this question and they are likely to pick familiar technologies such as printing or electricity. They are unlikely to suggest an innovation that is just as signiﬁcant: the ﬁnancial contract. Widely disliked and often considered grubby, it has nonetheless played an indispensable role in human development for at least 7,000 years.  

... ﬁnance ... can act as an economic time machine, helping savers transport today’s surplus income into the future, or giving borrowers access to future earnings now. ([ ? ])

# 1 Procedural & Introduction  

Who Are We? Prof Coleman: Education  

• BA physics Harvard, PhD economics University of Chicago  

Main Career  

• Over 20 years in the ﬁnance industry, Trading derivatives, building trading systems, running a hedge fund  
$\bullet$   I came back to Chicago in 2012 – it has been an unexpected pleasure and opportunity The practical experience is important – value in combining  

• Deep knowledge of market practice • The theory and quantitative tools we learn here at Chicago.  
# Procedural  

Lectures & Problem Sessions  

• Lectures M & W, 3 hours lectures  

• TA Sessions – we will announce ﬁnal schedule early this week  

Text – The main material are class notes, lectures – slides posted  

• Textbook:  Principles of Corporate Finance  by Brealey, Myers, Allen  

• I have created a custom “ebook” – selected chapters, cheaper  

• This text is “Corporate Finance” but I like the chapters on stocks   $\&$   bonds better that other texts  

Grading  

• Problem sets – 20% – roughly 1 every week-and-a-half –  You must work and hand in solutions in groups (2-4 people) –  Choose groups by next Monday –  Smallest part of grade, but most important – if you can do problems you will pass the course with ﬂying colors  

• Midterm – 35%  

• Final – 45%  

# You can use either  Text: Full Text vs. e-book  

•   BMA  – the Full Textbook Brealey, Myers, Allen textbook  Principles of Corporate Finance . 13th  edition. ISBN: 9781260013900. Earlier editions also good  •   Cust  –the custom e-book that I produced with selected chapters from BMA, that you can buy at a  lower price (ISBN 9781307696639 at  https://www.mh education.com/highered/custom/product/9781307696639.html  )  

Here is a guide to the chapters in the full textbook and the custom e-book

# Problems & Study Groups  

Problems assigned and due roughly weekly  

• First problem set (easy) due Thursday, cover in Friday TA sessions • Thereafter, due Monday. Work in groups  

Study groups - we will assign groups on Friday  

• 3 or 4 people in your group  

• Work together   $\&$   hand in a single write-up (after  Problem 1 ) • Everyone in a study group gets the same grade. As in a business situation, general presentation are important.  

You decide on how split the work  

• Control shirking and divide the work so you all learn • If you work on the problems and understand them, you should be able to pass the exams; if you do not work on the problems, you will probably not pass the exams.  

# You Need A Calculator  

I strongly recommend the HP 17BII+ (not absolutely necessary – if you know how to use another calculator)  

• Improves on the classic HP 12C by doing corporate and eurobonds in addition to US Treasuries. • The TVM functions are the same (only faster).  

Here are some choices:  

• The actual calculator, on-line at Amazon for somewhere between \$30 & \$90. Very retro. • iPhone and iPad app: \$9.99: Search for "hp 17BII" and you will ﬁnd the “hp 17BII-Pro” made by "r.l.m. software" – they also make an “RLM-17BX” but I have the 17BII-Pro –  Also http://www.rlmtools.com/iPhone/17BII/Detail.html • Android I do not have as good suggestion – if you can ﬁnd PowerOne Financial Calculator by Inﬁnity Softworks  
# 2 Big Ideas in Finance  

# Contents  

Investment & Capital – They Are Throughout Economics • Physical capital and investment • Human capital and education • Financial capital and investment –  What we will focus on Always: Investing today for future returns • The central focus for ﬁnance – transforming cash ﬂows back and forth over time, people, risk characteristics • Here – focus on details of investment and capital in a way we don’t in other parts of economics But central ideas very much the same  

Ideas for Finance Course:  

I. Investment & capital: theme throughout economics  

• Physical capital investment • Human capital and education • Financial investment – what we will focus on • Really important to understand that investment   $\&$   capital is a recurring theme throughout economics: investing today for future returns  

# 2.1 TVM & Uncertainty – The Only Ideas in Finance  

# Contents  

# Only Two Ideas in Finance  

I. Time Value of Money (TVM) – today vs tomorrow Framework:  Micro I Indi"erence Curves / Budget Lines Concepts:  PV; FV; yield, discount rate, IRR, interest rates; real vs nominal rates Assets/Instrument:  Everything – bonds, swaps, options, equities, business projects II. Uncertainty & Risk – certain (known) vs uncertain Cash Flows Framework:  Expected utility. Di"erent picture & mathematics Concepts:  risk premium; risk-adjusted discount rate; bond credit spreads; risk-neutral valuation and options Assets/Instrument:  Corporate bonds, options, equities  
# Understand TVM & Risk – You Understand Finance  

But that’s an immense job – for a few reasons  

Two big goals for this class:  

I. Learning the language – for UST e.g. 98-18+ means “price of   $98+18.5/32\,\mathrm{p}$  er   $\S100$   nominal of bond”  

II. Learning the instruments – how to unravel CFs  

• What are bond CFs? • What are swap CFs?  

I. There are really only two central ideas we will be working with in this course: (A) Time Value of Money – today vs tomorrow  

• For this we use the pictures from Micro I of Indi"erence Curves / Budget Lines • Concepts: PV, FV, yield and IRR, interest rates, real vs nominal rates, • Assets / Instruments: Everything – bonds, swaps, options, equities.  

(B) Uncertainty and risk – how to value certain vs uncertain cash ﬂows  

• For this we will work with expected utility and use a di"erent picture and mathematical foundations • Concepts: risk premium; risk-adjusted discount rate; bond credit spreads; certaintyequivalent; risk-neutral valuation and option valuation • Assets / Instruments: Corporate bonds, options, equities • If you understood everything about these two ideas (TVM & valuing uncertain CFs) you would understand everything about ﬁnance.  

II. If you understood everything about these two ideas (TVM & valuing uncertain CFs) you would understand everything about ﬁnance.  

• Unfortunately, even though there are only these two underlying ideas, understanding all about them is an immense job. For a few reasons: • The basic ideas are simple but how they apply to the real world – how we translate them from abstract ideas to concrete applications – is inﬁnitely complicated. –  Consider just bonds. There are US Treasury bonds – seem simple because they are as close to known (certain) CFs as we can get. So for some purposes we can ignore uncertainty and risk. But we have to learn how US Treasury bonds are structured (most have ﬁxed coupons, paid semi-annually, but Bills pay only at maturity). And prices – what does a quote of 99-15 mean? (\$99 + 15/32) There is a whole lot of practical issues and complication. And then there are foreign government bonds: British Gilts (also semi-annual, but some slight di"erences) and German Bunds and French OATs (annual coupons). And then we move to corporate bonds, of which there are an almost inﬁnite variety. And those have uncertainty so we have to worry about risk and default. Fixed coupon US Corporates usually (but not always) pay semi-annually but slightly di"erently from US Treasuries. Floating rate bonds have a whole variety. And then US Municipal Gov’t bonds.  
–  Much of this complication is just learning the terms and conventions: ∗UST are ﬁxed coupon, semi-annual, quoted A/A  $^*$  Bunds and OATs are ﬁxed coupon, annual, quoted A/A  $^*$  US Corporates are ﬁxed coupon, semi-annual, quoted 30/360  

• You need to learn the language – what do people mean when they say “semi-annual”, “A/A”, or “30/360”?  

–  These are just code-words that tell you how big and when CFs occur, or how a price or yield gets quoted. –  Part of this course is teaching you the special language used by people in the ﬁnancial markets  

• You need to unravel the sometimes complicated cash ﬂows and structures to ﬁgure out how to apply the very simple TVM and uncertain CF ideas.  

–  The CFs for things like swaps and options are often complicated and confusing. You need to learn about them, and you need to learn how to read carefully to understand the contract – when and how much are the cash ﬂows, and how likely are you to get them. –  This is often a very di!cult job. Sometimes people try to make things complicated. But sometimes the world is just complicated – instruments have to be made complicated to match the real world.  

# 3 Silicon Valley Bank Crisis  

# Contents  

Silicon Valley Bank – Classic Bank Crisis We are in the middle of a classic banking crisis • This is absolutely wonderful – for this course but not for the world Today I am going to spend some time talking about SVB • Also two others in the news – First Republic and Credit Suisse These three are very di"erent SVB • Solvency problems that led to liquidity problems (bank run) First Republic • Lost money but still looks solvent • But depositors worried, created liquidity problem Credit Suisse • Poorly managed for many years – just not a very good company (maybe my biased opinion)  
# 4 What is a Bank?  

# Contents  

# Bank as Lender & Money Creator  

Two main purposes or activities of a bank:  

I. Business like any company: raises funds and invests  

• All companies raise funds by issuing equity (from shareholders) and debt (borrowing) • The company then uses those funds to run a business • Apple builds computers and smartphones. A bank makes loans, provides banking services (credit cards, ATMs), and invests  

II. Creating money (liquidity)  

• Money is complicated, and later we will spend some time on money • For now, take my word that banks “create” something we use for day-to-day transactions  
 !500  

We can look in a simple bank balance sheet to see the two activities.  

• The loan business is easy to see on the asset side – lending to business or individuals and charging a rate that’s higher than the interest paid on the liability side. • The money business is in the banknotes / deposits. –  When this works we can use the deposits as money – they are generally accepted by other people easily and quickly. –  Looking at the move from banknotes to deposits helps us understand  
# 4.1 What are Deposits? What is Money?  

# Contents  

To Understand Deposits – Think about  Money What is money? One of the hardest questions in economics • Start with currency – pieces of paper printed by the government  

• Example: Zimbabwe 20-dollar bill –  No photo of US \$ - not legal –  Zimbabwe fun – 2nd worst inﬂation ever  

• Anyone my age has used currency  

• Worked pretty well as money for many years  

 !500  

Currency  is (or was) Pretty Good as Money  

A piece of paper printed by the government  

•  Payments : very fast and easy – in 1920s when many transactions face-to-face. (Less now with buying and selling electronically)  

•  Keeps value : lasts pretty well, does not “melt” like ice  

•  Unit of account : need to think about this  

•  Liquid : easy to buy / sell  

• Pretty good as “money” for many years  

 !500  
# More Money –  Demand Deposits  

• Currency good for face-to-face – not as good for distant and electronic transactions –  Need something that can be easily stored and transferred electronically  

• In the late 1800s, banks (at least in US) started issuing demand deposits –  A special type of security, a loan to a bank, –  Bank promises to pay back on demand and at par (  $1\S$   for every   $1\S$   loaned)  

• Special kind of loan, two special characteristics  

I. Promise to pay back on demand & at par –   $\S$  1-per-\$1 II. Upon default, pay ﬁrst-come – ﬁrst-served –  If you’re late, you get nothing –  Strong incentive to get ﬁrst in line – Bank Runs  

• Very di"erent than other loans (bonds) –  Regular bond-holders, upon default, get pro-rata share (assets divided according to payment hierarchy)  

• Works nicely as money –  Transfer from one bank to another –  Originally by paper check, now electronically  

# Demand Deposits (Checking Account) – Loan to Bank  

“Bank Deposits” are the checking account you and I use • We think of it as “money” – we “put our money into the bank” WRONG : it is a loan you and I make to the bank  

• But a very special type of loan (debt) Apple Computer (2022, \$bn)  

ST Debt:   $<$   1yr; LT:   $>$   1yr  

• Bonds or loans have a  maturity • When default, remaining assets shared among debtors Silicon Valley Bank (2022, \$bn)  

Deposit loans are day-by-day  

• Can redeem at any time  

• When default, ﬁrst person in line gets  $\S100$  , last gets zero

# 4.2 Liquidity, Solvency, and Inherent Instabilities in Banking  

# Contents  

Use SVB to Illustrate  Solvency  and  Liquidity  Problems Solvency : Consider SVB actual 2022 Balance Sheet vs Hypothetical “Big Loss” Assume a big loss on  Investments  

•  Assets down, and liabilities must match  

• “Shareholder’s Equity” gets “written o!”  

• Shares (equity) loses value  

SVB Actual 2022 (\$bn) 
 !500  

SVB “Big Loss” (\$bn)  

 !500  

With “Big Loss” SVB is barely solvent (almost insolvent or “in default”) • Insolvency (default) means not enough assets to pay back debtors • In this example, just barely solvent (assets just more than debts) In this case debtors are (mostly) depositors  

# Solvency  versus SVB Actual 2022 (\$bn)  

 !500  

# SVB “Big Loss” (\$bn)  

 !500  

Now in a very delicate position, with both  Solvency Risks  and  Liquidity Risks Solvency Risk  

Depositors worried investments may go down more  

• Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early  

• Deposits can, and rational to do so  

• Get out now, before things get worse  

Liquidity Risk  

Even if knew  for sure  assets would not go down  

• Assets may be  illiquid  – take a few months or year to sell o!  

• Depositors may need money back sooner  

• Rational to get ﬁrst in line, take money out now  

In either case, depositors will likely withdraw and the bank will likely fail  

• Bank will not have enough liquid assets (cash) to pay depositors  
# Fundamental Issue: Banking Inherently Unstable  

• The fact that deposits can be redeemed at any time makes banks inherently unstable Here are some things which can reduce some of the risks: I.  Solvency : Be extremely transparent and up-to-date in value of assets (so everyone has conﬁdence that the balance sheet numbers are reliable) II.  Solvency : Carefully manage the interest rate risk (duration mismatch) and the credit risk of assets III.  Liquidity : Hold liquid assets (easily and quickly sold). If depositors ask for their funds, assets can be quickly sold. IV.  Deposits : Find deposits that are more “sticky” – depositors who are not likely to move their money quickly  
# 5 SVB and the Past Few Years  

# Contents  

# Examine What Happened over Past Few Years  

I.  Solvency : Transparent and up-to-date value of assets  

II.  Solvency : Manage interest rate (duration) risk (and credit risk)  

III.  Liquidity : Hold liquid assets  

IV.  Deposits : Find “sticky” deposits  

SVB did more-or-less the opposite – it was hard to get the true numbers behind the published balance sheet  

•  Delving a little into details about banking & accounting • Most bankers like to put assets into  Held-to-Maturity  portfolio • Claim that they will hold until maturity, so can report (on balance sheet) at original cost  

• Horrible, dangerous idea, but bankers (and regulators) do not like or trust market prices and markto-market  

 !500  
$\%$   of total assets, and SVB stands out as above average  

SVB (apparently) did a horrible job at this  

•  The Economist  pointed out they bought long-dated US Treasury (and mortgage) bonds as deposits grew (in 2018, 2019, 2020)  

• Bought bonds when rates were low (and prices high) • In 2021 and 2022, interest rates soared, and bond prices fell • SVB apparently did not manage (hedge) that risk  

• Together with HtM of problem (1), means SVB lost money but nobody could easily see (until March 8)  

• They eventually had to sell all of their non-HtM portfolio (called  Available for Sale  assets) and lost  $\S1.8\mathrm{bin}$  . No doubt more losses in the HtM portfolio  

 !500  
# My Conclusion: SVB Made Mistakes, But Did Many Things Right  

SVB did many things right.  

• Little speculative or risky loans or investments –  Very di"erent from 2008 mortgage crises, where banks loaded up on worthless mortgages –  SVB invested in US Treasuries and high-quality mortgage bonds  

Let me be very clear: SVB made mistakes. Mistakes that led to failure  

• Asset-liability (duration) mismatch: borrowed short-term (deposits), invested long-term (bonds) –  Classic banking activity, but always risky and needs to be well-managed –  SVB managed poorly  

• Poor reporting and accounting  

Large  Held-to-Maturity  portfolio that obscured underlying asset-liability (duration) mismatch  

This is basic, simple, banking-101 – and SVB got it wrong • Looks like SVB messed up the old-fashioned way, not through anything unethical or nefarious  

# Examine More Closely SVB Losses on Assets  

Picture (from NYTimes) shows gains   $\&$   losses for both HtM and AfS portfolio  

• Trying to capture true value of assets • Losses as   $\%$   of deposits – SVB up to   $9\%$  

• Look at the “Big Loss” below – I chose 9% of deposits  

• Close to true situation for SVB in 2022 – nearly insolvent  

• People did not realize until March 8  

When run started, massive loss of deposits.  

• I’ve heard \$41bn left in a day or two • Looking at balance sheet (\$173.1bn deposits) no way they could survive

# 6 Deeper into Asset-Liability (Duration) Mismatch  

# Contents  

# Thinking Carefully About Asset-Liability (Duration) Mismatch  

Let’s use the SVB balance sheet to think about asset-liability and duration mismatch • “Duration” or interest rate sensitivity is a topic we cover in the next week or two  
• You will not be able to fully understand this discussion, but we will return to this  
Some points re any bank balance sheet:  
• Assets and liabilities must always match 
• Assets generally long-dated (long duration) 
–  What does this mean? Discuss “duration” next week  
• Liabilities (deposits) short-dated  

 !500  

Let’s use some of our tools (BPV and duration) for quick calculations on assets vs liabilities • BPV and duration is what this course is about – you will learn this in the next few weeks  

Assets : pretend all “Investments” are 8-year bonds • BPV / Duration would be about 7.0 today Rates    $\uparrow$  about 250bp (  $1\%$   to   $3.5\%$  ) from 2020-2022  

• Let’s say on average, 150bp. •   $7.0~\mathrm{BPV}\,\times\,150\mathrm{bp}\,\times\,\S125.1\mathrm{ba}\Rightarrow\mathrm{loging}~\S13\mathrm{ba}$  • How to do this? I will assign problem set  

Liabilities : focus on “Deposits”  

• Technically, BPV / Duration 0.0 (daily maturity) • When rates  $\uparrow$  and Assets  $\downarrow$  , deposits no change • Big problem as Equity must  $\downarrow$  to balance  

In reality,  some  deposits are “sticky”  

• The more sticky, the higher the duration

Remember – Derivatives – Not Assets, “Derived” from Assets What is “Derivative”: Payout (proﬁt / loss) derived from something  

• Value is derived from some other asset or security • Not “assets” (generally) – don’t invest, don’t buy & own something • Often not “securities” but instead individualized contracts  

“Asset”  

• a “thing” such as an equity (part-ownership of a company) or a bond (right to future payments) • something you buy, you give money and get ownership • Financial assets: equities, bonds • Non-ﬁnancial assets: car, house, computer, your human capital

 “Security”  

• a standardized and tradeable ﬁnancial instrument • originally a piece of paper documenting the details of an asset and documenting ownership. Now usually stored electronically  
[^1]: 1 What Are Futures?

Contents  

 !500  

Important components:  

• Futures price today, agree today to trade at that price on the future (delivery) date  
–  Daily MtM  

–  Just a way to ensure that price doesn’t move too far, and that everyone has the money to pay their losses. P&L settled end of every day  

• Futures vs Forwards  

• Underlier – what we agree to trade in the future –  Examples of physical commodities: a bushel of wheat, a pound of cocoa, an ounce of gold, a barrel of oil –  Examples of ﬁnancial futures: bonds, stock indexes  

• History  

–  Early contracts & original impetus: agricultural commodities, to allow farmers and consumers (millers, slaughter-houses) to lock in prices today. CBOT listed grain contract 1864 –  Starting in 1970s and 1980s, introduced ﬁnancial futures  

• Margining  

–  NOT payment. Payment occurs at the future date –  Mechanism to ensure there is money easily available to pay on days that price goes against, to make Daily MtM easy and smooth  

• Exchange  

–  stands in the middle to mitigate credit risk  

• Standardized contract  

–  Exchange deﬁnes everything except price – price negotiated between parties –  Size; deliverable (underlier); delivery mechanism; delivery date;

# Movie “Trading Places” – Frozen Orange Juice  

Movie  Trading Places  from 1983, starring Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis • Best I’ve seen of (old-style) open-pit futures trading Fun movie based around trading Orange Juice futures  

• The older bad guys have stolen a crop report (inside information) • They believe OJ crop will be poor, pushing prices up • Aykroyd & Murphy switched the report; they know crop will be good • Bad guys order their trader to buy futures, before report released • Others see what’s happening, everyone starts buying • Aykroyd & Murphy wait until price is high, then sell at high price • When good news comes out and price falls, Aykroyd & Murphy buy back at low price

• 1:50: Open price at 102.  

• 2:00-2:12: Wilson buying. Louis and Valentine waiting for price to rise  

–  Randolph and Mortimer conﬁdent (based on (false) inside information) that price will go up when crop report (poor harvest) released at 9:30 –  Others see that Duke & Duke trader buying, and Duke brothers watching. This is only big mistake in the movie – Dukes would buy through other brokers, not tip o! that they are buying  

• 2:29: Wilson still buying, Valentine wants to sell, Louis says wait from price to go higher  

• 2:30: Price at 142, Louis shouts “sell 30 at 142” – everybody else wants to buy (following Dukes)  

• 2:55: Price starts to go down (as Louis and Valentine sell). –  Dukes ﬁgure out what has happened – crop report faked –  try to get down onto the ﬂoor, try to tell Wilson to sell (close out the earlier buys) –  Louis & Valentine continue to sell

# Margining  

No cash up-front for forwards or futures As price changes, proﬁt to one side, loss to other Futures Daily P&L and Margining – mechanisms reduce credit risk  

Daily P&L – Every day, we receive proﬁt or pay loss (to exchange)  

• Ensures that credit risk never grows too big • Contrast with forwards – P&L accumulates and can get big  

• Exchange makes us post margin – still ours but physically at exchange. (We earn interest on this money)  

# Margining Initial Margin  

• Name says it: the initial amount • Might be   $10\%$   or   $25\%$   or even 50% of contract value – depends on volatility – how much price changes day-by-day  

# Variation Margin  

• Amount to be maintained every day • Something like 75% of Initial Margin  

# Futures versus Forwards  

• Both agree today for trade at future date FORWARDFUTURESPrivate contract, trade OTC Publicly traded, on an exchange Customized date, size, etc. Standardized delivery date, size, etc. Proﬁt / loss settle at expiry Daily MtM: Proﬁt / loss settled every day

# Delivery Mechanism  

At end of contract, need to force futures to match cash market Simple for wheat, deliver 5,000 bushels  

• “Buy”, pay cash price, receive 5,000 bushels  

Cash vs Physical  

• Physical: 5,000 bushels OK for farmer, inconvenient for “speculator” • Cash: exchange di!erence between agreed and ﬁnal price –  For futures, done increment ally every day, for forward done lump sum at end –  Stories about forgetting and having wheat show up on doorstep  

To relieve “cornering” pressures, window and various grades  

• Problem if one person buys all the physical, forces cash prices up/dn • Settlement during a window (wheat, 7 business days after last trade, which is day before 15th of delivery month) • And grades of wheat (No. 2 soft red winter, no. 2 hard red winter, ...)  

Most contracts closed prior to delivery

FIS stock on Friday (11-may-18) was trading at   $\S104.89$  Option to buy on 18-may for \$105, trading at \$0.80 Option Terminology:  

•  Underlier : What the option is written on  

•  Call vs Put : Buy vs Sell (this is a Call)  

•  Expiry : date to buy or sell (18-may, 7 days away)  

•  Strike : price   $(\S105)$  
$\mathrm{P}>\mathbb{S}105$  : buy at   $\S105$  , sell at P, proﬁt P-105t

  $\mathrm{P}<\S105$  : do nothing  

• You can only win with an option  

• Must pay for that privilege

• Expiry May 18, in 7 days .019yr  

• Strike \$105: valuable if P  $^{\circ}\!>$  105  

For valuation we:  

[^1]: Back out average forward price (on May 18) from today’s price 2. Get some estimate / assumption for volatility (spread) of price distribution 3. Get our option CFs and average – in this case    $E\left[P-105\mid P>105\right]$  4. Discount back at risk-free rate

# A.4 Application – Callable Bonds  

# Contents  

 !500  

From Bank of America’s perspective, the call feature is a call option: if bond price   $<100$   then no extra proﬁt (but no loss) while if P  $>$  100 BAC gets extra proﬁt, P–100  

• We can think of the callable bond as a package of a non-callable bond (what we have been dealing with) and a call option • Bank of America owns the option (has the right to redeem, has bought the option) and the investors are short the option (have sold the option)  

• Bank of America will have to pay for this option. This makes the bond value lower:  
$$
P_{c}=P_{n c}-C a l l
$$  

• BAC has bought the option – paid a fee by borrowing less money than they would have by issuing a bond with the same coupon but non-callable  

• Investors have sold the option – received a fee by lending less money than they would have for a non-callable bond with the same coupon  
# Yield-to-Maturity Doesn’t Work  

We want the yield for this bond (how much we earn):   $\mathrm{P{=}\S95.80}$   on 19-feb-16 But does it go to Call date or Maturity date?  

• Maturity (1-sep-2045) y=4.972%ab  

• Call (1-sep-2018) y=6.536%ab  

But neither is right. CFs beyond Sep 2018 are uncertain – not because of default but because of option  

• But we know that    $P_{c}=P_{n c}-C a l l$  

• We know how to value standard    $P_{n c}$  

• And we just learned how to value  Call  

The relation that the callable bond is the package of non-callable less call option holds at the expiration date and every date before.  

So the bond price today is  
$$
P_{c}=P_{n c}-C a l l
$$
  ↔  

Now we need to value the callable bond. But we know exactly how to do that: simply use the Black-Scholes option formula  

 !500  
 !500  

Note: there is no easy way to do this bond option on the HP calculator. The reason is that the HP formula takes in the spot price (price today) and calculates the forward price.  

• Forward formula (you calculate the forward price and put it into the formula). This is also called the Black Forward version  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{F o r w a r d\,F o r m u l a:\,C a l l=N(d_{1})\cdot S_{T}\cdot e x p(-r T)-N(d_{2})\cdot X\cdot e x p(-r T)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{d_{1}={\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}}}\left[l n\left({\displaystyle{\frac{S_{T}}{X}}}\right)+{\displaystyle{\frac{\sigma^{2}T}{2}}}\right]\,d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T}}}\end{array}
$$  

• Spot formula (you put in the spot price for the underlier and then it calculates the forward price by forward valuing:    $S_{T}=S_{0}\cdot\exp(r T)$   or    $S_{0}=S_{T}\cdot\exp(-r T)$  

•  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{S p o t\:F o r m u l a:\:C a l l=N(d_{1})\cdot S_{0}-N(d_{2})\cdot X\cdot e x p(-r T)}}\\ {{d_{1}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}\left[l n\left(\frac{S_{0}}X\right)+r T+\frac{\sigma^{2}T}{2}\right]\:d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T}}}\end{array}
$$  

You can use the calculator but you have to calculate the spot (stock) price that the calculator needs to produce a forward price of 96.01:    $S_{0}=S_{T}\cdot\exp(-r T)=96.01\cdot\exp(-.0485\cdot2.53)=84.923$  . This is completely di!erent from the actual spot price of the bond (\$95.80) because there are coupons that the forward pricing formula    $S_{0}=S_{T}\cdot\exp(-r T)$   does not take into account.  

 !500  
# Yield-to-Maturity Too High For Callable  

 !500  

Market:  $P_{c}=95.80$  

# Calculating Option-Adjusted Yield  

Yield for standard bond: discount rate or what we earn holding to maturity Yield for callable bond: what we earn holding to ??  

• Solve for    $y$  :    $P_{c}(y)=P_{n c}(y)-C a l l(y)=P_{m a r k e t}$  • This is now an  option-adjusted  yield – accounts for uncertain CFs  

For callable, we earn less. Using standard ytm overstates what we earn  

• Try lower yields until    $P_{c}(y^{*})=P_{n c}(y^{*})-C a l l(y^{*})=P_{m a r k e t}$  • Problem set: you solve for    $y^{*}\mathrm{~-~}4.50\%$   guess not low enough  

 !500  

For a standard bond we solve for the yield-to-maturity from the simple discounting formula  

For a callable bond we need to recognize that it is a package of a regular non-callable bond (using the simple discounting formula)  minus  the callable bond.  

We need to ﬁnd the yield which satisﬁes this equation, and there is no easy way to do it except by trial-and-error.  

# Discussion of Option-Adjusted Yield for Risky Bonds  

For a callable bond the idea is that we solve for    $y^{*}$  that solves:  
$$
P_{c}(y^{*})=P_{n c}(y^{*})-C a l l(y^{*})=P_{m a r k e t}
$$  
This is all ﬁne for a government bond where the discount rate is the risk-free rate. But for the BAC bond that is not the case. In fact, one reason we want to calculate the option-adjusted yield for the BAC bond is to correctly measure the risk premium – the spread between the government (risk-free) rate and the BAC yield after adjusting for the option part of the BAC bond.  

The problem is that option valuation is based on discounting at the risk-free rate. We need to do the option part at the risk-free rate    $r f$   and not the option-adjusted (risk premium) yield    $y^{*}$  . Basically, we should be using:  
$$
P_{c}(y^{*})=P_{n c}(y^{*})-C a l l(r f)=P_{m a r k e t}
$$  

Conceptually this is OK – we know from the US Treasury (  $3\%$   of 15-nov-45) that the risk-free yield on 19-feb-16 is 2.61%ab. Our challenge is to calculate the forward price of the BAC bond given the risk-free rate of 2.61%ab. We don’t really have an  easy  way to do this. You can use the forward pricing screen on Bloomberg. Alternatively you can use the BOND menu on the HP  

• Pricing for settle date 19-feb-16, maturity 1-sep-2018  

• put in a “Call” equal to a guess for the forward bond price • price the bond at yield of 2.61%ab – this will now account for all the coupons between 19-feb-16 and 1-sep-18 • adjust the “Call” up and down until the “Price” is equal to the desired bond price  

As an example, let’s look at:  

•   $\mathrm{y}^{\ast}=4.50\%\mathrm{ab}$   which means spot price (settle 19-feb-2016, maturity 1-sep-2045) is 103.207 • The HP BOND menu for doing the forward pricing (settle 19-feb-2016, maturity 1-sep-2018, call 98.038) is:  

 !500  

This produces the desired spot price (or close enough, 103.2056) so a forward price of 98.038 is the spot price given by the risk-free rate (from 19-feb-2016 to 1-sep-2018) of   $2.61\%\mathrm{ab}$  .  

Now we can calculate the Black-Scholes option price, using as the “short rate” the UST yield of  $2.61\%\mathrm{ab}$     $(2.58\%c c)$  .

 !500  

Option Pricing For BAC bond using risk-free rate of   $2.61\%$  ab to calculate forward price If we go through this laborious process we will get an answer not too far from Bloomberg. (Note  
that 4.500%ab is not too far o! – the Pc is 96.157, slightly higher than the market price of   $\S95.80$  , meaning that the yield of 4.50%ab is too low.)  

 !500  

# Bloomberg OAS for BAC  

# Option-Adjusted Yield Gives Risk Premium  

Yield-to-Maturity = 4.972%ab, spread = 236bp Option-Adjusted-Yield (Bloomberg) = 4.48%ab,  $\mathrm{{spred}=187\mathrm{{bp}}}$  For callable, we earn less. Using standard ytm overstates what we earn But we have again used the market to back out the risk premium

# 1 What are Derivatives?  

Derivatives – Not Assets, “Derived” from Assets What is “Derivative”: Payout (proﬁt / loss) derived from something • Value is derived from some other asset or security • Not “assets” (generally) – don’t invest, don’t buy & own something • Often not “securities” but instead individualized contracts

 “Asset” • a “thing” such as an equity (part-ownership of a company) or a bond (right to future payments) • something you buy, you give money and get ownership • Financial assets: equities, bonds • Non-ﬁnancial assets: car, house, computer, your human capital

 “Security” • a standardized and tradeable ﬁnancial instrument • originally a piece of paper documenting the details of an asset and documenting ownership. Now usually stored electronically Derivatives are “derived” from something else.  
Bonds, money markets, equities – these are all “assets” in the sense that you invest money and then own something, you have some right to future cash ﬂows. You have bought something  

Futures and Swaps: Two Common Derivatives Futures – What they are  

• Come back next class  

Futures – Institutional details  

• Exchanges – centralized trading. Used to be open outcry “pits” now electronic • Margining – putting money up-front to reduce & manage credit & default risk • Securities – standardized contract deﬁned by the exchange  

# Futures and Swaps: Two Common Derivatives  

Swaps – What they are  

• Simple – a contract to exchange (swap) cash ﬂows between two companies  

Swaps – Valuation  

• Teach you how to think about, how to PV these simple instrument • Show how thinking about CFs makes things simple • These “complicated” derivatives are not that di!cult after all  

Swaps – Institutional Details  

• Trade OTC (Over the Counter) • Used to be no centralized exchange • Now moving to centralized clearing – to reduce   $\&$   manage credit risk • Not a security but an individual contract between two parties  
# Goal: Show that mapping CFs makes things simple  

These “complicated” derivatives are not that di!cult after all  

• Cannot emphasize enough value of simple (but correct) approaches that get you 95% of the way • My experience – if someone cannot give simple explanation for trade or business, signals underlying problems –  They don’t understand well enough –  They understand but don’t want you to understand – maybe to enhance their status, maybe there’s something going on  
# 2 Floating Rate Instruments (Swaps & Bonds)  

[^2]: 1 Floating Rates – Libor & SOFR

# Contents  

 !500  

This trick of replacing the 4th year ﬂoating payment with   $\S100$   at yr 3 is really general but really powerful  

Comes from the deﬁnition of “ﬂoating rate”  

• Floating rate  $=$   rate that ﬂoats (goes up & down) until the PV today is   $\S100$  

• Today, sitting at year 0, the rate (payment at year 1 gets set. How does it get set? People auction (o"er to buy   $\&$   sell or to invest or take investments) until the rate for year 1 gets set so that  $\mathrm{PV}(\S100\mathrm{~+~}\mathrm{rate})=\S100$   today.  

–  That is the deﬁnition of the ﬂoating rate: the rate so that PV today is   $\S100$   $\begin{array}{r}{-\ \S100=P V(\S100(1+r))=\frac{100(1+r)}{1+r}}\end{array}$  –  The point is that we are discounting at the same rate as the promised (ﬂoating) rate  

• When we are sitting at year 3, the rate (payment) at year 4 gets set. How does it get set? Same as year 0 rate: rate set so that   $\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{yr~3})=\S100$  :    $\begin{array}{r}{\S100=P V(\S100(1+r_{4}))=\frac{100(1+r4)}{1+r4}}\end{array}$  –  This means we can cross out the payment at year 4 and move back to year 3.  
• But we can do the same for year 2 & 3: cross out    $r_{3}$   and replace with   $\S100$   at year 2 • Now we can do that for year 2 and year 1, and we are left with   $\S100$   at year 0.  

# LIBOR

# SOFR  

Secured Overnight Funding Rate • Replacement for libor for US Dollar bonds   $\&$   swaps  

The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. (NY Fed)  

Libor has many problems  

• Not a traded rate – survey of what banks think it should be  

• Open to manipulation  

The Libor scandal was a series of fraudulent actions connected to Libor and also the resulting investigation and reaction – during 2008 ﬁnancial crisis  

SOFR introduced in 2018, will be a di!cult transition from libor https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr  
Two Instruments: SWAP (L ﬂat); BOND (L + risk prem) Think about PV with ﬂoating rates for two instruments: • Libor Flat: will be important when turn to swaps –  Swaps generally between high-grade (libor-like) companies –  risk premium    $\approx$  0bp (relative to libor) • Libor + risk prem: important when looking at risk bonds –  Say FIS ﬂoating rate bond: risk premium  ⊋ 227bp  

We need to think about PV of a ﬂoating rate bond as discounting at  

• LIBOR FLAT: this will be important for thinking about swaps  

• LIBOR + Risk Premium: important for thinking about bonds

So far, working with ﬁxed coupon bonds • Our old friend,   $4~\mathrm{yr}~6.5\%$   ann coupon

Draw CF diagram and discounting exactly same • Dashed line to represent “ﬂoating” But how do we value those “unknown” CFs?  

 !500  
What is PV of those future unknown CFs? • Simple “trick” says   $\mathrm{PV}=100$  Not really a “trick” – just deﬁnition of libor ﬂoating rate • Libor is set so that   $\mathrm{PV}(100\mathrm{+biggr})=100$  • Libor rate up-and-down (supply/demand) until PV=100 Must be   $\S100$   (yld=coup) • Trick: rate at yr 3:  $\begin{array}{l}{-\mathrm{~libr~set~so~PV}(\mathrm{yr}3)=\S100}\\ {-\mathrm{~so~put~in~}\S100\mathrm{~at~yr~}3}\end{array}$  • Now move back to yr 2, then yr 1 • Run back to today (yr 0) PV today has to be   $\S100$  discount yld=libor 100 100 floating coupons floating coupons   = libor+0   = libor+0 N=4 N=4 PV=100 PV=100 PV=100

What is a Swap? – “Traditional” Diagram  

Developed early (1980s) – today probably the largest of swaps  

• This makes up only one segment of the swap market.  

Focus on a ﬁxed-ﬂoating swap  

• Concrete ness – dealer receives ﬁxed and pays ﬂoating. • Traditional swap diagram showing the direction of cash ﬂows  

 !500  

What is a Swap? – CF Diagram Traditional CF diagram useful for seeing who gets paid what.  

• But useless for understanding valuation, PV I ﬁnd the following CF / time-line diagram more useful • Four years, receive 5% ﬁxed, pay ﬂoating semi-(annually) • Actual USD swaps generally semi ﬁxed, quarterly ﬂoating • Swap contract to exchange cash ﬂows Simple instrument, but question • How do we value? How do we get PV and DV01? Valuation is pretty simple, using a simple trick.

# In-Class Exercise for Swap Valuation  

Now we know answers  

• Value and DV01 –  Same as bond – what we’ve been doing – value swaps on HP  

• In-class Exercise – PV of swap PV of 5yr swap to receive 5% ﬁxed semi – current rate 1.7%  

 !500  

•   $\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{swap})=115.75-100=\S15.75$  • BPV of swap = 5.20 \$/100bp  

You now know everything about swaps  

• What they look like (CF diagram)  

• How to value (PV of bond)

# Quoted Swap Rate = Market Yield  

Swap market quotes rates – e.g. 2.874%sab for 10-yr for 23-mar-16 What does this mean?  

• Tells you about a speciﬁc swap trading in the market  

• Coupon such that swap PV is 0  
$\mathbf{PV(swap\,\,R\,\,coup\,\,c)}=\mathrm{PV(bond\,\,with\,coupon\,\,c)}-100\$   $\Rightarrow\mathrm{PV(bound~with~coopen~c)}=100$   $\Rightarrow\mathrm{yield}=\mathrm{c}$   (since yield=coupon for par bond)  

• So it also tells you about the yield on a speciﬁc “bond” Swap rates in US quoted as spread to US Treasury – always semi  

• Convenient way to split overall rate into –  Risk-free discounting, changes with: UST. (2.825% on 23-mar-18) –  Swap-speciﬁc risk, spread to UST (4.9 bp on 23-mar-18: 2.874=2.825+.049) • With quoted rate c, you know PV (zero) and BPV (of ﬁxed bond coupon  $\mathrm{\Pi}.=\!\mathrm{c}$  , yield  $\mathrm{\Omega}.=\!\mathrm{C}$  )

# 3.2 Why Swaps? – Some History & Examples  

# Contents  

 !500  

 !500  
Example of two companies with di"erent credit in ﬁxed and ﬂoating bonds markets.  

We assume here that both companies issue the same bonds – say 4 yr maturity – but their credit is di"erent in the two markets  

This used to happen more than it does because di"erent groups of investors have a) Di"erent preferences for ﬁxed vs ﬂoating bonds and b) Di"erent assessment of Co A vs B – those who like ﬁxed think Co B worse than A by 100bp, those who like ﬂoating think Co B worse only by 75bp  

Doesn’t happen much now precisely because of swaps – they allow easy arbitrage across these markets  

Markets have developed since http://www.swapsinfo.org

# Contents  

Modern Example – Chicago Bonds, Swaps, and Termination 2005: City of Chicago issues bonds. General Obligation (GO) 2005D Variable Rate Demand Bonds • Roughly 30 years maturity • Variable rate, meaning coupon goes up (or down) as overall interest rates up • GO: payments backed by city resources, including tax revenues. –  Strong backing from the city; usually considered to be high quality Chicago, like any city or company, had to choose between  ﬁxed coupon  and  variable rate  bonds • Choice depends on large variety of factors – expectations, revenues, risks, and costs • Probably most important: Does (tax) revenue change with interest rates? –  Generally  no  so paying variable rate is risky (relative to ﬁxed coupon) –  City revenues don’t change much with interest rates, so ﬁxed coupon more reasonable • Risks: a) ﬁxed coup, rates    $\downarrow$  PV city owes    $\uparrow$  ; b) variable rate, rates    $\uparrow$  and annual payments ↓ • Costs ﬁxed vs variable coupon – if investors prefer variable rates, require higher ﬁxed coupon Partly luck: if choose ﬁxed coupon and rates go down, lose  
# Chicago Chose 30yr Fixed Coupon – Using a Swap – Why Di!erent?  

Chicago chose ﬁxed coupon, but could do that with  ﬁxed coupon bond  or  ﬂoating bond   $\scriptstyle\mathcal{+}$   swap  

 !500  

Would pay ﬁxed coupon  

•  Presumably higher than   $4.1\%$

The ﬂoating rate “ﬂows through”  

•  Chicago e!ectively pays ﬁxed coupon   $4.1\%$  • Note: spread “Chicago” coupon and SIFMA rate (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) – average muni ﬂoating coupon  

Floating “Chicago” coupon can change  

•  Chicago credit    $\downarrow$  Floating “Chicago” Coupon    $\uparrow$  but not SIFMA

# BACKROUND  

During the early-to-mid 2000s the City of Chicago (like many cities) raised money through issuing ﬂoating rate bonds and then entering into swaps to convert them into synthetic ﬁxed-payment structures. As an alternative, the city could have instead issued a ﬁxed coupon bond. There has been much ink spilled about how much the swaps have cost the city. I want you to critically examine the question of how much the swaps cost. Spec i call y, in this problem we are going to compare the ﬂoating-bond-plus-swap synthetic structure with a more-standard ﬁxed coupon bond to examine whether and by how much the two structures di"ered. We will do this by focusing on one speciﬁc bond and swap:  

• Bond: General Obligation 2005D  

• Swap: \$66.837mn, Chicago pays   $4.10\%$  , receives ﬂoating  

# PART I: BACKGROUND ON THE BOND AND THE CITY DOWNGRADE  

When the city issues a bond it is borrowing money. It sells the bond by taking money up-front, giving the investor a bond contract, and promising to pay back as speciﬁed in the contract.  

# BOND  

We are going to examine the General Obligation 2005D Variable Rate Demand Bonds, CUSIP 167486NP0 & 167486NQ8. (A CUSIP is a nine-character alphanumeric code that identiﬁes a North American ﬁnancial security (bond or stock) for the purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of trades. The CUSIP system is owned by the American Bankers Association, and is operated by S&P Capital IQ.)  

• “General Obligation” means that the payments on the bond (payments of coupon and repayment of principal) are backed by a pledge to use city resources, including tax revenues. Usually the entity (City of Chicago in this case) promises to levy a property tax to pay. In other words this bond has strong backing from the city, and this type of bond is usually considered to be high quality.  

• “2005D” means that it was issued in 2005, as one of a series of bonds issued that year. I believe it was issued August 2005, with original maturity in   $2040\mathrm{~-~}35$   year maturity when originally issued. It was a variable rate or ﬂoating rate issue.  

A bond may be issued with either a ﬁxed coupon (most of the bonds we have been discussing are ﬁxed-coupon) or a ﬂoating coupon. This GO 2005D VRDB (General Obligation 2005D Variable Rate Demand Bond) was a ﬂoating-rate bond. For these bonds the rate was re-set every week or every day – it was a ﬂoating rate that depended on the general level of interest rates in the market and the speciﬁc credit rating of the City of Chicago.  

When the city sells a ﬁxed coupon bond the city is short a ﬁxed coupon bond. Now we are going to see how much the value of a ﬁxed-coupon bond would change due to the change in rates from 2005 to 2015.  

This problem is intended to focus on one speciﬁc bond issue and swap:  

• Bond: General Obligation 2005D  

• Swap: \$66.837mn, Chicago pays 4.10%, receives ﬂoating  
This swap was terminated in May 2015, for reasons discussed below. The city had to pay the swap counter party (BMO) \$21.0885mn to terminate the swap. We will try to understand where the amount   $\S$  21mn came from, and discuss why the city had to pay this swap termination fee.  

I have attached a page from the City of Chicago that shows some details on various bonds and swaps that were terminated. This particular bond and swap are listed under “General Obligation 2005” and “Counter party BMO”. (You can ﬁnd the full memo on Canvas under “Files / Problems” (name “Swap Termination 2003 B Wells Fargo Red acted.pdf”). It used to be hosted by the city at

# DETAILS ON ACTUAL BOND & SWAP BOND:  

• “General Obligation” means that the payments on the bond (payments of coupon and repayment of principal) are backed by a pledge to use city resources, including tax revenues. Usually the entity (City of Chicago in this case) promises to levy a property tax to pay. In other words this bond has strong backing from the city, and this type of bond is usually considered to be high quality.  

• “2005D” means that it was issued in 2005, as one of a series of bonds issued that year. I believe it was issued August 2005, and that it matured in 2040 – 35 year maturity when originally issued. It was a variable rate or ﬂoating rate issue.  

# SWAP :  

• Notional: \$66.837mn  

• Chicago pays ﬁxed   $4.10\%$  

• Chicago receives SIFMA, which is an average ﬂoating rate index of municipal issuers (i.e. it should match the variable rate on the bond above).  

• Counter party BMO (Bank of Montreal)  

Chicago was required to cancel the swap with BMO in May 2015. (We will discuss more in class why Chicago had to cancel the swap, but the short story is that the swap contract had provisions that the swap could be terminated, at the request of BMO, if the credit rating of the City of Chicago fell below certain levels. In March 2014 and again May 2015 Moody’s downgraded Chicago, and that triggered the termination provisions.)  
# What Happens When Rates Fall: Fixed vs Floating   $^+$   Swap: 20052015  

Simplifying assumption: both ﬁxed coupon and swap rate   $4.77\%$   (match 30yr swap rate in 2005) • 31 May 2005, 10-yr = 4.42%,  30-yr = 4.77%  20-yr rate = 4.689%  (from yld_fwd6.xls)  

PV(30yr bond, coupon=4.77%, yld=4.77  $\%$  )  

 !500  

• 29 May 2015, 10-yr = 2.20%, 30-yr = 2.62%  20-yr rate = 2.52%  (from yld_fwd6.xls)  

PV(20yr bond, coupon=4.77%, yl  $1{=}2.52\%$  )

# Our Simple “Bond + Swap” – Matches Actual Cancel Fee  

Actual BMO Harris swap of   $\S66.8$  mn notional, required   $\S21.09\mathrm{mm}$   payment  

• Our very simple analysis predicts   $\S23.5\mathrm{mm}$  , not too far wrong • We predict swap down by \$35.18 per \$100, or \$23.5mn per \$66.8mn !  $\begin{array}{r}{\{\S23.5m n=\S66.8m n\cdot\frac{35.18}{100}\}}\end{array}$  "  

Our very simple (but correct) approach to swaps teaches us what we need for Chicago swap termination  

• Issue seems complicated, but surprisingly simple  

# Why Chicago Forced to Cancel in 2015?  

What forced the cancellations?  

• Pension problems – Illinois and Chicago –  Illinois had   $\S$  236bn liabilities (2016) – of which \$182bn was unfunded pension and retiree health beneﬁts –  City of Chicago similar scale of problems –  Post-2008, problems grew larger  

• Chicago downgraded 2013 (Aa3 to A3 – big jump) and 2015  

• Crain’s March 2013: Chicago downgraded because of Illinois problems: as of 2013 (IL unfunded pension \~\$97bn, IL worst credit rating in the nation)  

• Crain’s Aug 2015: Chicago unfunded liabilities \$29.80bn,   $15\%$   of property tax base, highest in the nation  

# Downgrade Provisions in swaps  

• Banks (legitimately) worry when rates    $\downarrow$  and swap has negative value to Chicago • What if Chicago defaults, and does not pay? • Downgrade provisions allow banks to force termination when large downgrade – protects banks  
Problems With Termination Two basic problems • Chicago has to come up with cash now, instead of paying over next 20 years –  Terminate swaps and issue new bond • Chicago has to issue new bond with higher coupon because credit risk higher Many said “Swaps a Mistake – Chicago lost money” • My Conclusion: Chicago lost a lot from falling rates – but would have lost roughly the same on ﬁxed coupon bond Worsening Credit – Chicago also lost from rising credit risk • Reﬁnance when credit spread is bad • With ﬁxed coupon bond, might have avoided paying higher credit spread

Most companies (like FIS) not “high quality” • Coupon = libor + sprd  

The libor part up / dn every quarter • The spread part ﬁxed for life of bond  

What is value today for 4yr bond, libor   $^+$   sprd? First (wrong) trick – cross out libors to today  

• Left with spread to discount  

 !500  

• But now sprd stays  

Left with spread to PV  

• PV(annuity)  $\bullet\ \mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{floater})=100+\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{annity})$  

Sprd = 75bp, 4yr rate   $6.6\%$  
$\mathrm{PV}=100\substack{+\mathrm{PV}(0.75\xircledcirc6.6\%)}$

# Correct Idea – Discount Libor+Sprd   $@$   Libor+Sprd  

Most companies (like FIS) not “high quality”  
$\mathrm{Coulomb=l i b o r+s p r d(c o u p)}$  • Discount = libor + sprd(today)  

The sprd(coupon) ﬁxed at issue The sprd(today) goes up & down every day  

# Risky co di"cult  

 !500  

Must discount libor+sprd(issue)   $\mathrm{\Large~\textcircled{\scriptsize~}}r f\mathrm{\scriptsize~+~}r p=\mathrm{\large~\textmu~}+\mathrm{\large~\left(today\right)~}$  

• No simple way to discount and calculate PV  

• Need to project future libor (ﬁgure out those unknown libors – forward curve)  

• Then discount the L+sprd(issue) at  $\mathrm{yield}=r f\!+\!r p=\mathrm{L}\!+\!\mathrm{sprod}(\mathrm{tday})$  

But here’s an approximate way:  

• Figure out “average” libor – ﬁxed swap rate good approximation  

• Treat FRN as ﬁxed bond with coupon = Swap + sprd  

• Get    $r p$   (sprd(today)) from a ﬁxed-coupon bond (like FIS    $r p=227\mathrm{bp}$  )  

• Discount at yield = Swap   $^+$   spread(today)  
# PV Floating Bond with Spread – In-Class Exercise  

“Libor+spread”: Say libor   $^+$   75bp (Libor 2-nov-18 3.105% 1yr)  

PV of 4yr L+75bp:  

• 4yr swap   $3.154\%$  ,

–  Take money in from public (customers give money to MMF or Tether) –  Promise to pay back \$1 for every   $\S1$   put in  

• Reserves – Hold some cash as reserves to pay out customers  

• Assets  

–  Use some of deposits for other business, to make proﬁts  

Di!erences  

• MMF subject to many rules and laws (e.g. auditing) –  Result: transparency  

• MMF invests only in short-term, high-quality assets –  Stay close to \$1  

• Tether not subject to same rules –  Result: little transparency  

• Tether may invest in longer-term assets of unknown quality  

–  May lose value, may default  
# What if Tether Invests in US Treasury Bonds?  

Tether will invest assets in  something , rather than all   $\S100$   in cash. Two important questions: 1. How long duration? (Go up & down with rates? Liquidity risk.)  

[^2]: What credit quality? (Default and money lost? Solvency risk.)

 !500  

Examine only duration question (sensitivity to interest rates)  

•  Why invest in longer bonds? 3mth bills vs 10yr bonds?  

•  Earn more on longer-term bonds – TBills vs TBonds  

• Longer duration  $\rightarrow$  more sensitivity if rates go up  

• Invest   $\S80$   of assets in 10-yr TBonds, now worth \$76.18.  

• Could not pay everyone back

# Remember SVB – Exactly “Investing in UST” (long duration)  

SVB invested in UST – safe (credit) but long-dated  

• Interest rates  $\uparrow$  in 2022, assets  ↑ Picture (from NYTimes) shows gains & losses  

• Losses as   $\%$   of deposits – SVB up to 9%  

• “Big Loss” below –   $9\%$   of deposits  

• SVB in 2022 – nearly insolvent  

• People did not realize until March 8  

• Looking at balance sheet (\$173.1bn deposits) no way they could survive

# Reminder on Using Sharpe – Idea of Leverage  

Step back: what if we combine a risk-free (  $\sigma=0$  ) asset with an e"cient portfolio (return   ,  $r_{\mathrm{pert}}$  standard deviation    $\sigma_{p o r t}$  )  

•  Any  of our e"cient portfolios Use portfolio 1. Get    $\begin{array}{r}{r=r_{f}+\frac{r1-r f}{\sigma1}\cdot\sigma}\end{array}$   (for any    $\sigma$  ) • Controlled by  Sharpe   $\begin{array}{r}{R a t i o=\frac{r1-r f}{\sigma1}}\end{array}$  

Example:    $r_{\mathrm{f}}{=2\%,\;r_{1}}{=6\%,}$  ,    $\sigma_{1}=10\%$  .  

• Sharpe = 0.4  

• Along the line    $r=2+0.4*\sigma$  
$$
\bullet~\sigma=5\%,~r=2{+}0.4^{*}5=4\%
$$  

•  ε  = 15% ,  r  = 8%

# Capital Market Line – Choose Highest Sharpe Portfolio  

Want large Sharpe Ratio – Sharpe  $\uparrow$  line    $\uparrow$  

• Don’t use just  any  portfolio, choose largest Sharpe. • Call this line the CML – just touches the frontier • Red line. Call the chosen portfolio the  market  portfolio. Only one used  
$$
\boldsymbol{r}=\boldsymbol{r}_{f}+\frac{r\boldsymbol{m}-\boldsymbol{r}f}{\sigma\boldsymbol{m}}\cdot\sigma=\boldsymbol{r}_{f}+\boldsymbol{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}\cdot\sigma
$$  

Sharpe Ratio important  
$\begin{array}{r}{S h a r p e=\frac{r1-r f}{\sigma1}}\end{array}$  • Higher Sharpe  $\Rightarrow$  higher risk-adjusted return • Investors and hedge funds look at Sharpe all the time  

• S&P Sharpe  $=0.37$     $(7.3\%/20\%)$  )  

 !500  
# Capital Market Line & Separation – Really Important  

Wonderful result: separate preferences (utility function) from market (the frontier)  

• Choose portfolio with the highest Sharpe  

• Adjust our volatility depending on our preferences  

The  market portfolio  is absolutely key

A few things  

[^1]: Pretend “market” is stock market (S&P 500) 2. Measure RP by measuring history:    $\approx7.3\%$

[^3]: Doesn’t help with RP for individual assets

 !500  

We care only about overall  market  portfolio  

•  Market  volatility    $\sigma_{m}$   matters – but  not  vol for individual assets  

But this doesn’t really help us:  

• We’ve separated out preferences from market (e"cient frontier)  

• We now know that only one portfolio – the portfolio with highest Sharpe – will be chosen –  There will be individual assets within that portfolio, but overall there will only be one market  portfolio chosen  

• We have the Expected Return and Volatility for that overall market portfolio –  From ER we get Risk Premium:   $\mathrm{ER}=\mathrm{rf}+\mathrm{RP}$   or   $\mathrm{RP}=\mathrm{ER}-\mathrm{rf}$  

• This tells us  how  we get that ER (RP) & Vol. –  For now we are going to pretend that the “Market” is the stock market – the S&P 500 index –  Not correct (as we saw with bonds & stocks, can do better by combining them) but that is what textbooks generally do  

• We can measure this ER (RP) & Vol by looking at history of stock market –  Risk Premium \~ 7.3%, Sharpe \~ 0.37  

• But this doesn’t help answer our question of how do we get RP for individual asset  
# Price of Risk: Where We Are, Where We Go  

We need to calculate  risk premium  to value uncertain cash ﬂows We can get risk premium for  

• Bonds (e.g. for FIS promised cash ﬂows: yield spread    $Y_{F I S}-Y_{U S T}$  ) • Overall equity market (historical:    $R_{S\&P}-R_{U S T}$  :   $7.3\%$   or   $6\%$  ) • We need theory to give FIS RP as function of S&P RP  

•  Divers i cation: how vol at ili ties “add” –  Digression on Sharpe ratio  

•  Portfolio construction: how we build portfolios •  How we choose the “market” portfolio: Capital Market Line • Contribution   $\&\ \beta$  : how individual securities contribute to portfolio vol •    $\beta$   measures contribution to overall portfolio vol, so    $\beta$   matters

# What is Individual Asset Risk Premium?  

CML & Market Portfolio give return (so risk premium) for whole portfolio, whole market Market volatility (  $\cdot\sigma_{m}$  ) determines market return (risk premium, price of risk) But we need risk premium for an individual stock – say FIS  

• Need to go from market to FIS • What determines FIS risk premium (price of risk)?  

•  Cannot  be FIS volatility or FIS Sharpe Remember Bond & Stock portfolio – Bonds low vol, low Sharpe  

• 20% bonds gave portfolio with higher Sharpe • But bonds contribute to portfolio, are valuable, • Compensated by earning positive Risk Premium – earning more than risk free

Individual Securities – Contribution & Beta   $(\beta)$  Market portfolio, and market volatility (  $\sigma_{m}$   or    $\sigma_{p o r t}$  ) matters – not individual volatility • If this is true, only care about    $\sigma_{p o r t}$   and not vol for individual assets,    $\sigma_{i}$  • Compensated only for how individual security contributes to    $\sigma_{p o r t}$  • We need a measure for how individual securities contribute to    $\sigma_{p o r t}$   . Look back at the formula for portfolio volatility – play magic with algebra  $\sigma_{p o r t}=\sqrt{w_{1}^{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}^{2}+2\cdot\rho\cdot w_{1}\cdot\sigma_{1}\cdot w_{2}\cdot\sigma_{2}+w_{2}^{2}\cdot\sigma_{2}^{2}}$   $\sigma_{p o r t}=\frac{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}=\frac{w_{1}^{2}\sigma_{1}^{2}+2\rho w_{1}w_{2}\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}+w_{2}^{2}\sigma_{2}^{2}}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$  Want to split into two parts: contribution from 1 (  $w_{1}$   only) and from 2 (  $w_{2}$   only) How?

# Revisit Bond & Stock Portfolio – and Contribution  

 !500  

Some results for    $\beta\cdot\sigma_{p}$   di!er due to rounding Portfolio Avg Return: weighted mean of Bond & Stock returns •    $\mu_{p}=w_{1}\cdot\mu_{1}+w_{2}\cdot\mu_{2}$  , contribution is weight \* avg return   $\left(w_{i}\cdot\mu_{i}\right)$  Portfolio Volatility (Standard Deviation,    $\sigma_{p}$  ):  not  weighted mean  

& $$
\sigma_{p}=\sqrt{w_{1}^{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}^{2}+2\cdot\rho\cdot w_{1}\cdot\sigma_{1}\cdot w_{2}\cdot\sigma_{2}+w_{2}^{2}\cdot\sigma_{2}^{2}}
$$  

• Bond & Stock don’t contribute their weight    $w_{i}\cdot\sigma_{i}$  , but    $w_{i}\cdot\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p}$  
$\sigma_{p o r t}=w_{1}\cdot\beta_{1}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}+\beta_{2}\cdot w_{2}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$  

Individual volatility    $\sigma_{i}$   does ot matter  – only    $\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p}$  Portfolio Avg Return: Bond & Stock Avg returns    $\mu_{i}$   matter  

ε  $\sigma_{p o r t}\neq w_{1}\cdot\sigma_{1}+w_{2}\cdot\sigma_{2}$  

Portfolio Volatility (  $\mathit{\Delta}^{O}\mathit{p}$  ): Bond   $\&$   Stock    $\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p}$   matter  
$$
\sigma_{p o r t}=w_{1}\cdot\beta_{1}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}+\beta_{2}\cdot w_{2}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}
$$  

Individual volatility    $\sigma_{i}$   does not matter  – only    $\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p}$  Contribution    $\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p}$   depends  on Bond & Stock volatility  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{1}\cdot\sigma_{p}=\frac{\left(w_{1}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\rho w_{2}\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}}}\end{array}
$$  

But also weight, vols, correlations of all other assets • Consider  how this asset i ﬁts into portfolio Because    $\beta_{i}$   &  $\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p}$   matters,  price of risk  depends on    $\beta_{i}$   and not    $\sigma_{i}$  
# Beta (  $\beta$  ) as Covariance and Regression Coe!cient  
$\beta$   is also coe"cient in regression:  
$$
\hat{r}_{i}=a+\beta_{i}\cdot\hat{r}_{p o r t}+\varepsilon_{i}
$$  

Decomposes into “Systematic” or “Non-Divers i able” (  $\beta_{i}\cdot\hat{r}_{p o r t}$   or    $\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$  ) and “Idiosyncratic” or “Divers i able” (  $\varepsilon_{i}$   or    $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$  )  

Remember regression coe"cient deﬁnition (from statistics):  
$$
\beta_{i}=\frac{C o v\left(r_{i},r_{p o r t}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}
$$  

and for  
$$
r_{p o r t}=w_{1}\cdot r_{1}+w_{2}\cdot r_{2}
$$  
$$
\beta_{1}=\frac{C o v\left(r_{1},w_{1}\cdot r_{1}+w_{2}\cdot r_{2}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}=\frac{\left(w_{1}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\rho w_{2}\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}
$$  

Two (equivalent) interpretations   $\&$   meanings of    $\beta$  : 1. Contribution to risk:    $\sigma_{p o r t}=[w_{1}\beta_{1}+w_{2}\beta_{2}]\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$  

[^2]: Regression  (  $\hat{r}_{i}=a+\beta_{i}\cdot\hat{r}_{p o r t}+\varepsilon_{i})$  , decomposition into “Systematic”   $(\beta_{i}\,\cdot\,\sigma_{p o r t})$   and “Idio sync rat ic” (  $O_{\varepsilon}$  )

#  $\beta$   as Decomposition of Change in Vol  

Decomposition    $\sigma_{p o r t}=[w_{1}\beta_{1}+w_{2}\beta_{2}]\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$   seems completely ad-hoc (just algebra) but actually deep  

# Truly gives the  Contribution  

• Now consider in nites i mal (percent) change in vol (remember that  dln  is essentially   $\%\mathrm{ch}$  ):  
$$
d\,l n\left(\sigma_{p o r t}\right)=\frac{d\,\sigma_{p o r t}}{\sigma_{p o r t}}=\frac{1}{\sigma_{p o r t}}\left[\frac{\partial\,\sigma_{p o r t}}{\partial\,w_{1}}d w_{1}+\frac{\partial\,\sigma_{p o r t}}{\partial\,w_{2}}d w_{2}\right]
$$  

• But this means the    $\beta\mathrm{s}$   give the decomposition of the change in vol for changes in the di!erent assets:  
$$
d\,l n\left(\sigma_{p o r t}\right)=\beta_{1}d w_{1}+\beta_{2}d w_{2}
$$

Beta Measures Individual Security Price of Risk  

• For any portfolio, Beta decomposes the overall volatility:    $\sigma_{p o r t}=[w_{1}\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}w_{2}]\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$  Since we care about individual assets’ contribution to portfolio volatility, and since    $\beta$   measures this, seems that    $\beta$   is the natural “risk” measure – expected returns should depend on    $\beta$  • Assets with higher    $\beta$   should have higher return • More risk (higher    $\beta$  ) means higher return We expect    $E R_{i}=f\left(\beta_{i}\right)$   – meaning that expected returns depends on    $\beta_{i}$   and not    $\sigma_{i}$  • Wouldn’t it be nice if the function were linear?    $E R_{i}=a+\beta_{i}\cdot c o n s t$  
Amazing Result: For Any  E!cient  Portfolio,    $E R_{i}=\gamma+\beta_{i}\cdot(E R_{p}-\gamma)$  

Individual assets don’t line up with  volatility  

• We expect they should line up nicely with    $\beta$  :    $E R_{i}=f\left(\beta_{i}\right)$  

# But here’s the really amazing thing  

• For any  E!cient  Portfolio,  it is linear  

• The assets and weights in  any  portfolio on the e"cient frontier must be chosen so that    $\beta_{i}$  all adjust until    $E R_{i}=\gamma+\beta_{i}\left(E R_{p o r t}-\gamma\right)$  

• Remember,  $\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{1}=\frac{\left(w_{1}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\rho w_{2}\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}}\end{array}$  , so as we adjust weights    $w_{i}$   the    $\beta_{i}$   adjust until they all line up  

Assets 1, 2, 3 don’t line up in  Return vs Std Deviation  

• But there is a  $\gamma$   so that all assets line up (with their own    $\beta_{i}$  )  

Assets  do  line up in  Return vs    $\beta$  

 !500  
# Example: Returns Line Up With    $\beta$   for All  E!cient  Portfolios  

Let’s set how assets line up with our simple Bond   $\&$   Stock portfolio  

•  Important : for our 2-asset example (B+S)  all  combinations are on e"cient frontier  

• For many assets, must ﬁ ntier ( Minimize  $\begin{array}{r}{V a r i a n c e=\sum_{i,j}w_{i}w_{j}\sigma_{i j})}\end{array}$    !  

• All assets should line up:  $E R_{i}-\gamma=\beta_{i}\cdot(E R_{p}-\gamma)$   ↓  ·  ↓  

 !500  

Focus on   $80\%$   bonds, and let’s solve for    $\gamma$   – answer is    $\gamma=-5.55$  :  
$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{B:\;5.4-\gamma=0.903\left(6.58-\gamma\right)}&{}&{5.4-\left(-5.55\right)=0.903\left(6.58-\left(-5.55\right)\right)}\\ {S:\;11.3-\gamma=1.389\left(6.58-\gamma\right)}&{}&{11.3-\left(-5.55\right)=1.389\left(6.58-\left(-5.55\right)\right)}\end{array}
$$  

Does  not  match what we see in the market Now   $20\%$   bonds, still lines up, but with    $\gamma=4.48$  :  
$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{B:\;5.4-\gamma=0.164\left(10.12-\gamma\right)}&{{}}&{5.4-4.48=0.164\left(10.12-4.48\right)}\\ {S:\;11.3-\gamma=1.209\left(10.12-\gamma\right)}&{{}}&{11.3-4.48=1.209\left(10.12-4.48\right)}\end{array}
$$  

Does  not  match what we see in the market What about   $38.8\%$   bonds?  Market Equilibrium  – answer is    $\gamma=3.90$  :  
$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{B:\;5.4-\gamma=0.294\left(6.58-\gamma\right)}&{{}\quad}&{5.4-3.90=0.294\left(6.58-3.90\right)}\\ {S:\;11.3-\gamma=1.448\left(6.58-\gamma\right)}&{{}\quad}&{11.3-3.90=1.448\left(6.58-3.90\right)}\end{array}

IMPORTANT: Often write CAPM as    $E R_{i}=r_{f}+\beta_{i}\left(E R_{m k t}-r_{f}\right)$  .  

• Confusing – Textbooks sometimes not very clear  

Two-step process  

[^1]: Use CAPM to get long-term (average) risk-premium:
$$
R P_{i}=\left(E R_{i}-E r_{f}\right)^{l o n g-t e r m}=\beta_{i}\left(E R_{m k t}-E r_{f}\right)^{l o n g-t e r m}
$$  
$$
R P_{i}=\beta_{i}\cdot R P_{m k t}
$$  

[^2]: Use risk premium to calculate  today’s  risk-adjusted discount rate:
$$
Y_{i}^{t o d a y}=r f^{t o d a y}+R P_{i}=r f^{t o d a y}+\beta_{i}\cdot R P_{m k t}
$$  

If write as “one-step” then it really is:  
$$
Y_{i}^{t o d a y}=r f^{t o d a y}+\beta_{i}\cdot\left(E R_{m k t}-E r_{f}\right)^{l o n g-t e r m}
$$

[^2]: E"cient Portfolio (mean-variance optimizing)

• Divers i cation – vol at ili ties don’t add • Individual assets contribute based on    $\beta_{i}$   not    $\sigma_{i}$  • All assets have    $E R_{i}-\gamma=\beta_{i}\left(E R_{p o r t}-\gamma\right)$  

[^3]: Risk-free asset   $(\sigma=0)\to\mathrm{CPM}$

• Sets    $\gamma=r_{f}\Rightarrow E R_{i}-r_{f}=\beta_{i}\left(E R_{m k t}-r_{f}\right)$  • Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) & Securities Market Line (SML)  

Result: CAPM  

Price of risk (Risk Premium) set by    $\beta$  :    $E R_{i}-r_{f}=\beta_{i}\left(E R_{p o r t}-r_{f}\right)$  

# Some Facts About Beta (  $\beta$  )  

• Decomposes market vol:    $\beta_{i}\sigma_{m k t}$   is mkt vol due to    $i$  :    $\sigma_{m k t}=[w_{1}\beta_{1}+w_{2}\beta_{2}]\cdot\sigma_{m k t}$  • Beta is regression coe"cient of asset    $i$   against market:    $r_{i}=a_{i}+\beta_{i}r_{m k t}+\varepsilon_{i}$  
$$
\beta_{1}=\frac{C o v\left(r_{1},r_{p o r t}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}=\frac{C o v\left(r_{1},w_{1}\cdot r_{1}+w_{2}\cdot r_{2}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}=\frac{\left(w_{1}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\rho w_{2}\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\right)}{\sigma_{p o r t}^{2}}
$$  

• Decomposes asset return into “Systematic”   $(\beta_{i}\cdot\sigma_{p o r t})$   and “Idiosyncratic”   $\cdot\sigma_{\varepsilon}$  )  

• Beta averages to 1 for market (average market risk 1.0) –  Betas range around 1: Citi=1.45, Apple=1.06, FIS=0.79  

# More Facts About Beta – Correlation with Portfolio  
$$
\beta_{1}=\frac{c o v(a s s e t\:1,\:m k t)}{\sigma_{m k t}^{2}}=\rho_{1m}\frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sigma_{m}}
$$  

Beta depends on correlation of asset with overall portfolio  

• High    $\rho\,\&\,\beta\ \Rightarrow$  contributes to overall risk    $\Rightarrow$  should get paid for taking risk –  Standard textbooks talk about high    $\beta\ \Rightarrow$  high  systematic  risk –  You get paid for taking on systematic risk but not  idiosyncratic  risk  

• Low    $\rho\,\&\,\beta\implies$  contributes little to overall risk    $\rightharpoondown$  should get paid little for taking this risk –  If    $\rho<0$   it actually  reduces  risk, you should pay (not get paid) – negative RiskPrem  
$$
\beta_{1}=\frac{c o v(a s s e t\:1,\:m k t)}{\sigma_{m k t}^{2}}
$$  
$$
\rho_{1m}=\frac{c o v(a s s e t\:1,\:m k t)}{\sigma_{1}\cdot\sigma_{m k t}}\Rightarrow\beta_{1}=\rho_{1m}\frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sigma_{m}}
$$  
# Contribution & Beta in Risk Management  

Contribution & Beta used in Quantitative Risk Management Goes by various names in various books • Measure Portfolio Volatility or Value at Risk (VaR)  

• Contribution (or    $\beta$  ): individual asset contribution to overall risk  

 !500  

I found this the most useful measure in managing a hedge fund portfolio  

# Beta (  $\beta$  ) as Regression  

Beta as regression coe"cient of asset    $i$   against market:    $r_{i}=a_{i}+\beta_{i}r_{m k t}+\varepsilon_{i}$  •  How much  ﬁrm    $i$   moves when market moves on average, not  whether  they move together often (that is correlation,    $\rho$  ) –  Citi moves   $1.45\%$   when S&P500 moves 1%  on average –  Decomposes ﬁrm vol: systematic   $\left(\beta\sigma_{m k t}\right)$   versus idiosyncratic   $\left(\sigma_{\varepsilon}\right)$  :  ε  $\sigma_{i}^{2}=\beta^{2}\sigma_{m}^{2}+\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}$  –  CAPM:  Compensated only for systematic, not idiosyncratic

For everything (CAPM, Security Market Line, Capital Market Line) “market” portfolio is critical • Hold only “market” plus risk-free  

• Need to measure returns (returns & vol) for “Market”  

• Would like to include everything: stocks, bonds, real estate.  

• As a start, try to include all stocks

• You buy  $1\%$  ch, and earn the same:  $\textstyle\sum_{i}w_{i}r_{i}$  )  

• Always:  $\begin{array}{r}{r_{S\&P}=\sum_{i}w_{i}r_{i}\quad w_{i}=\frac{c o m p a n y\;v a l u e}{t o t a l\;v a l u e}}\end{array}$  ) Market-weighted  index

$$  

In other words, measures return on the “market”  

• Same return as owning   $1\%$   or   $0.01\%$   of each of the 500 companies

[^1]: Investors care about variability   $\&$   return

[^2]: Overall portfolio: volatility (  $\sigma$  ) sets price of overall risk

•    $E R_{i}$   (  $r_{i}$  ) vs    $r_{m}$   set by    $\beta_{i}$   & CAPM:  
$$
r_{i}=r_{f}+\beta_{i}\left(r_{m}-r_{f}\right)
$$  

• For individual asset, volatility   $\left(\sigma_{i}\right)$   doesn’t matter – only  contribution  or  systematic component    $\beta_{i}$  

CAPM gives us the  Equity Cost of Capital  

• For FIS bond, easy to get    $E R_{i}$   (  $r_{i}$   or RADR): yield to maturity • For FIS stock (equity), we now have CAPM: –  Long-run Average:    $r_{i}-r_{f}=\beta_{i}\left(r_{m}-r_{f}\right)$   or    $R P_{i}=\beta_{i}\cdot R P_{m k t}$  –  For today:    $r_{i}=r f+R P_{i}$  

# Beta (  $\beta$  ) for Citi, Apple, FIS  

Beta measures systematic component (moves with S&P500) Investors only compensated for systematic, not idiosyncratic  

• Idiosyncratic is the part that disappears in the portfolio • Not paid to take on what can be diversiﬁed away Beta does  not  say how much of ﬁrm volatility is systematic vs idiosyncratic • Doesn’t say  how volatile  ﬁrm is or  how much  of overall vol is left over  

 !500  

• Citi and Apple both high  total  vol, Citi moderate  idiosyncratic  vol –  Much of the Apple vol is idiosyncratic, can be diversiﬁed away –    $\beta$   moderate  

Only  systematic  (beta) vol matters for pricing risk  
CAPM – Comparing Across Stocks:    $r_{i}-r_{f}=\beta_{i}\left(r_{m k t}-r_{f}\right)$  

Some stocks have high vol & low beta (Newmont)  

• Low ExpRet & Risk Prem  

• High vol but not correlated with market  

• Helps to diversify, so you don’t get paid a lot for holding that stock  

Beta matters – gives us the ExpRet & RiskPrem

# Contents  

# Assumptions for CAPM  

[^1]: Individual behavior

• Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers. • Their common planning horizon is a single period. • Investors all use identical input lists, an assumption often termed homogeneous expectations. Homogeneous expectations are consistent with the assumption that all relevant information is publicly available. 2. Market structure • All assets are publicly held and trade on public exchanges. • Investors can borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate, and they can take short positions on traded securities. • No taxes. • No transaction costs. Clearly these do not all hold • CAPM will not hold – but excellent start  
# Alternative Theories  

We have assumed that only the “market” portfolio matters - most importantly that we have everything in the “market”  

Generally not true Alternative – Three Factor Model  

• Identify macroeconomic factors that could a!ect stock returns • Estimate expected risk premium on each factor (  $r_{f a c t o r1}\textrm{--}r_{\mathrm{f}},$  , etc.) • Measure sensitivity of each stock to factors ( b1, b2, etc.) Expected Risk Prem  $\begin{array}{c}{{R e t u r n=a+\beta_{1}r_{f a c t o r1}+\beta_{2}r_{f a c t o r2}+\beta_{3}r_{f a c t o r3}+\varepsilon}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{e c t e d\,R i s k\,P r e m=r-r_{f}+\beta_{1}\left(r_{f}-r_{f a c t o r1}\right)+\beta_{2}\left(r_{f}-r_{f a c t o r2}\right)+\beta_{3}\left(r_{f}-r_{f a c t o r3}\right)}}\end{array}$  

We will, however, stick with single-factor CAPM

Start Working with Probability   $\&$   Distributions So far avoided working directly with uncertainty   $\&$   distributions • Always in background, determining the risk premium • We have used the market to get risk premium:    $\begin{array}{r}{P V={\frac{E x p e c t e d\;C F}{1+r f+r p}}}\end{array}$  Now: work directly with  Distribution : the uncertainty of cash ﬂows / returns • Future distribution of cash ﬂows or returns is our fundamental tool • The distribution (uncertainty) will produce  price of risk • Often summarize with  mean  and  standard deviation  – but only summaries  

 !500  

# Working with Distributions: Mean and Volatility  

• Horizontal: CF or return in future • Vertical: probability or likelihood –  Technically: picture is density  

 !500  

We (almost always) work with mean ( µ or  $X$  ) and standard deviation   $(\sigma)$  

•    $\sigma$   called volatility in ﬁnancial markets. Also variance,    $\sigma^{2}$  

Often work with Normal Distribution  

• Classic bell-shaped, like in picture. Depends on  only  µ  &  $O$  • Works somewhat OK in ﬁnance – but many problems (fat tails!!)  

But we care about the whole distribution (not just    $\mu\,\&\,\sigma$  )  
# Portfolio: Mean, Volatility, and Correlation  

Portfolio:  

• Take   $\S100$  , invest across two assets,  A  &    $B$  • If put \$30 in    $A$  , then call the weight or fraction    $w_{A}(=\!0.3)$

# 3 Leverage and Sharpe Ratio – Risk Adjusted Return  

[^3]: 1 Sharpe Ratio: Risk-Return Relationship and Risk-Adjusted Return Contents

Using Leverage to Create Any Return Discuss how we can use  Leverage  to create any return we want • Leverage is making a  portfolio  by combining a  risky  asset with  riskless  borrowing or lending • Risky Asset: uncertainty in CF, volatility    $\sigma$  • Riskless Asset: known CF, zero volatility • Portfolio weight    $w$   held in risky asset (  $w$  =1 means hold only risky,    $w{=}0$   means hold no risky) Example: You have   $\S100$  , and can also borrow • Example 1: use your   $\S{100}$   to buy   $\S100$   of S&P index (risky) –    $w=1$  –  Zero leverage, no borrowing • Example 2: use your   $\S{100}$   plus  borrow another   $\S100$  , to buy   $\S100\,+\,\S100$   of S&P index –    $w=2$  –    $100\%$   leverage, borrowing equal to investment (equity)  

•    $w=1$  :   $\S100$   risky,   $\S0$   riskless,  $\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+1\cdot(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f})=\mu_{x},\,\mathrm{vol}\,\,1\cdot\sigma_{x}$  •    $w=2$  :   $\S200$   risky, borrow   $\S100$  ,    $\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+2\cdot\left(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f}\right)=2\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f}.$  , vol    $2\cdot\sigma_{x}$  •    $w=0$  :   $\S0$   risky,   $\S100$   riskless,    $\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+0\cdot(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f})=\mu_{r f}$  , vol    $0\cdot\sigma_{x}$  

Say    $\mu_{x}=5.4\%$  , vol    $\sigma_{x}=8.9\%$  , risk-free    $\mu_{r f}=3.9\%$  
$\bullet$     $w=1$  :   $\S100$   risky, earn 3.9+1(5.4-3.9)=5.4%, vol    $1\sigma_{x}=8.9\%$  •    $w=2$  :   $\S200$   risky, borrow   $\S100$  , earn 3.9+2(5.4-3.9)=6.9%, vol    $2\sigma_{x}=17.8\%$   $\bullet$     $w=0$  : \$0 risky,   $\S100$   riskless, earn 3.9+0(5.4-3.9)=3.9%, vol    $0\sigma_{x}=0$  
# How to Describe Leverage, Return, Volatility   $-$   William Sharpe’s Ratio  

Portfolio Return:    $\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+\boldsymbol{w}\cdot\left(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f}\right)$  Portfolio Volatility:    $\sigma_{p}=\boldsymbol{w}\cdot\sigma_{x}$  

Is there a simple way to write this, a simple statistic that summarizes return-vs-volatility relationship?  

• Yes,  Sharpe Ratio , introduced by William Sharpe  

Write leverage    $w=\sigma_{p}\big/\sigma_{w}$  , and then return is:  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+w\cdot(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f});\quad\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+\sigma_{p}\cdot\frac{(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f})}{\sigma_{x}}}\end{array}
$$  

and call that ratio the  Sharpe Ratio :  
$$
S_{x}=\frac{(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f})}{\sigma_{x}}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+\sigma_{p}\cdot S_{x}
$$  

# Sharpe Ratio – Risk-Return Relation   $\&$   Risk-Adjusted Return  

Portfolio Return:    $\mu_{p}=\mu_{r f}+\sigma_{p}\cdot S_{x}$  Sharpe Ratio:    $\begin{array}{r}{S_{x}=\frac{(\mu_{x}-\mu_{r f})}{\sigma_{x}}}\end{array}$  

· $$
\sigma_{p}=\boldsymbol{w}\cdot\sigma_{x}
$$  

Return equation now tells how return changes with volatility  

• Higher volatility (  $\sigma_{p}$  )  means higher return • Straight line (a!ne) relationship  

Sharpe ratio measures  risk-adjusted return  

• Higher Sharpe means get more return for higher volatility  

• Higher Sharpe means steeper line  

Sharpe describes Ret vs vol line  

 !500  
# Sharpe Ratio Example  

Combine two assets:  

•  Risky  asset X, return    $r_{x}$  , vol    $\sigma_{x}$  •  “Riskless”  asset (borrow   $\&$   lend.    $\sigma=0$  ), return   , vol    $\sigma=0$   $r_{f}$  

Example: choosing    $w=1$  ,    $w=2$  ,    $w=0$  Say    $r_{x}=5.4\%$  ,    $\sigma_{x}=8.9\%$  ,    $r f=3.9\%$  ,  $\begin{array}{r}{S_{x}=\frac{(r_{x}-r f)}{\sigma_{x}}=0.169}\end{array}$  

•    $w=1$  :   $\S100$   risky, earn 3.9+1(5.4-3.9)=5.4%, vol    $1\sigma_{x}=8.9\%$  •    $w=2$  :   $\S200$   risky, borrow   $\S100$  , earn 3.9+2(5.4-3.9)=6.9%, vol    $2\sigma_{x}=17.8\%$  

•    $w=0$  :   $\S0$   risky,  $\S100$   riskless, earn 3.9+0(5.4-3.9)=3.9%, vol    $0\sigma_{x}=0$  

Choose  vol  get   $\mathrm{return}=r f+v o l\cdot S_{x}$  
$,\mathrm{~w=1,}v o l=1^{*}8.9,\mathrm{~R=3.9+8.9^{*}0.169{=5.4}~}$   $\mathrm{w=2,\,\,}v o l\mathrm{~=~}2^{*}8.9{=}17.8\mathrm{,\,\,R=}3.9{+}17.8^{*}0.169{=}6.9$  •   $\mathrm{w}{=}0$  ,    $v o l=0^{*}8.9$  ,   $\mathrm{R{=}3.9{+}0^{*}0.169{=}3.9}$

It would be a mistake to think that because stocks have the higher Sharpe you should only buy stocks. It is true that if you had to buy only one or the other, stocks would be the best choice. But combining the two together you can get a higher Sharpe. For example, if the correlation between them were 0, a   $50/50$   portfolio would have a return of   $8.35\%$   and volatility of   $10.95\%$  . This gives a  $\mathrm{charge}=(8.35–3.9)/10.95=0.41$  .  
# Sharpe Widely Used – Part-Way to Measuring Risk  

Sharpe ratio and leverage idea incredibly useful and powerful  

• Considers risk-return trade-o"  

• But not yet correct measure for “Risk” (that will be    $\beta$   (beta) or contribution to portfolio risk)  

 !500  

Tells us that Stocks  look  more risky, but in a real sense  less  risky.  

• Can produce same vol as TBonds, higher return (7.2%)  

• Or same return, lower vol   $(4.05\%$  )  

But why invest in bonds at all?  

• Absolute risk (vol, standard deviation) is not the measure we need for risk  

Correlation matters – how an asset contributes to portfolio vol

$$  

Vol  not  linearly between bond   $\&$   stock vols  

• Bond & Stock don’t contribute their weight    $w_{i}$  • Portfolio vol  always  less than “Avg”, unless    $\rho=+1$  •  Free Lunch : combine assets and get lower vol, higher Sharpe  

contribution matters, not vol :    $\sigma_{p o r t}=[w_{1}\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}w_{2}]\cdot\sigma_{p o r t}$  

• Stocks are high vol   $(20\%$  ) but reduce portfolio vol   ${\left(10\middle/10\rightarrow\%\right/}10$   bonds) • Stock contribution   $(\beta_{s t o c k})$  ), not stock vol   $(\sigma_{s t o c k})$   matters  

• Need to learn about contribution   $(\beta_{s t o c k})$

• Remember – we can back out risk premium for a bond, but not a stock  
# Average Returns – Arithmetic vs Geometric  

Historical returns, over 100 years. BMA Table 7.1  

• Learn about  risk premium  

 !500  

We use  historic  risk premium as estimate of the risk premium for the stock market • Calculate historic year-by-year returns, and take the average  

But averaging returns brings up some confusing issues – that I never got straight until now (and I’ve never found anybody who could explain to me)  

# Two questions we ask when averaging historical returns  

Average risk premium Distribution of returns – if we pick an “average” year, what is return?  Arithmetic Average  Usual average  

“Average” growth during period How much growth, year-by-year, produces the growth we actually see?  Geometric Average  or continuously compounded  

• We don’t usually have to worry about di"erence, but compounding matters  
# Digression on Arithmetic vs Geometric Return  

“Big Oil” example (BMA ch 7): start at   $\S1.00$  /share, yearly changes “Simple” return is:    $\begin{array}{r}{1+r_{s i m p l e}=\frac{P_{1}}{P_{0}}}\end{array}$  

• What we usually think of and use  

Arithmetic average tells what happens in an “average” year:   $+10\%$  

• Does  not  tell us how much growth year-by-year  

•   $10\%$   for 3 year:   $\S1.331$  ,  not    $\Updownarrow1.287$  

 !500  

Geometric average gives year-by-year growth – overall growth  

• For year-by-year, Geometric, Compounding over 3 yrs:  $\textstyle\left({\frac{1.287}{1}}\right)^{1/3}=1.0877$  # \$ • If grow by 8.77% every year, go from   $\S1$   to   $\S1.287$  • Best for comparing growth across time, across assets • Can also do continuously-compounded (log changes):    $1+r_{s}=e^{r c}$  • Geometric / cc best for comparing over time, across assets  

# What is  Arithmetic  versus  Geometric  mean?  

Arithmetic: add up and divide by    $n$   (our regular mean or average)  

• Usually think about adding up    $R_{1}$  ,   $R_{2},\ldots,R_{n}$   $\textstyle{\mathrm{Mean}}={\frac{1}{n}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_{i}$  ! • But better to think of adding    $1+R_{1}$  ,    $1+R_{2},\dots,1+R_{n}$   $\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{Mean}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+R_{i}\right)=1+\frac{1}{n}\sum R_{i}}\end{array}$  ! !  

Geometric:  multiply  and  nth root :  

" $$
{\mathrm{Mean}}=\textstyle\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left[(1+R_{i})\right]^{1/n}=\left[(1+R_{1})\cdot(1+R_{2})\cdot\cdot\cdot(1+R_{n})\right]^{1/n}

History for Stocks, Bonds, Bills  

Additional issue for history:  

• Often  monthly , converted to annual  

 !500  

Use monthly data to reduce variance (better estimate) but need annual return • Returns independent, so OK to add, but issues adding arithmetic returns  

# Arithmetic    $\longleftrightarrow$  Geometric, Monthly    $\longleftrightarrow$  Annual  

Arithmetic    $\longleftrightarrow$  Geometric  $\begin{array}{r}{r_{A}\approx r_{G}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}}\end{array}$  
$$
r_{A,a n n}\approx12\cdot r_{A,m t h l y}\;\;\sigma_{a n n}\approx\sqrt{12}\cdot\sigma_{m t h l y}
$$

# Backing Out Equity Risk Premium From History  

Practice : history to “back out” risk premium • Remember what “risk premium” is: adjusting  Expected   $\begin{array}{r}{C F\colon P V=\frac{E x p\,C F}{(1+r f)(1+r p)}}\end{array}$  

Problem: We don’t know    $E x p\,C F$  

• But we do have many “experiments”:every month, invest   $\S1$   at beginning of month, see what happens at end  

 !500  

 !500  
# Backing Out Equity Risk Premium From History  

If markets are e!cient (investors use current information to predict  Expected CF ) then we can use those monthly “experiments” to get  Expected   $C F$  

•    $\textstyle P V={\frac{E x p\,C F}{(1+r f)(1+r p)}}$    or re-write    $\textstyle1+r f+r p={\frac{E x p\,C F}{P V}}$  • We don’t have  Exp   $C F$  , but we do have  Act CF • Returns:    $\begin{array}{r}{1+r e t u r n={\frac{A c t\,C F}{P V}}}\end{array}$  • Assume investors are using  Exp   $C F$   every month • Arithmetic Average over many months,  $\begin{array}{r}{\frac{E x p\,C F}{P V}=\frac{A v g[A c t\,C F]}{P V}=A v g[1+r e t u r n]}\end{array}$  • For risky (S&P):  $\begin{array}{r}{1+r f+r p=\frac{E x p\:C F}{P V}=A v g[1+r e t u r n]}\end{array}$   Do same for “risk-free”:  $\textstyle1+r f={\frac{E x p\,C F}{P V}}$

For backing out Risk Premium, use  Arithmetic  because we want  Expected CF  (not Geom Avg CF)  

• For comparing over history, still use Geometric Average

# Historical Equity Premium

Estimate Equity Risk Premium using historical returns  

• RP = Equity return – Risk-free  

Table shows history, 1900-2011  

• Treasury Bills: short-term risk-free rate  

• Government Bonds  

• Common Stocks: basically, S&P 500 index (since 1920s)  

Equity risk premium  $=7.3\%$  

• Debate about size of rp  

• Maybe   $6\%$   is better  

 !500  

Table is Brealey & Myers, Table 7.1  

We now have “Equity” risk premium – for the overall equity market  

• But considerable debate on whether   $7.3\%$   is “too high”. Some reasons:  

–  Equity returns in the 20th century were much higher than expected. It’s the expected return, not the realized return, that we need. Fama and French (2000, I think) show that the expected ERP was only   $3\%$  . –  Expected returns to individual investors were much lower than to the broad-market benchmarks because there were no index funds for most of the period, taxes and fees were high, and most portfolios were un divers i ed (often single-stock) requiring a return-equivalent penalty to be applied for the greater risk of un divers i cation.  
Why not do the same for each individual stock? Say FIS on its own?  

• Not enough history  

• Individual ﬁrms, even ones with long history like GM, change over time • Using the overall stock market, we get the risk (cost of uncertainty) for something that is relatively stable over long periods

These assumptions clearly not realistic. Why is the whole idea useful?  

•  We get strong results: M&M Prop 1: capital structure – debt vs equity – does not matter •  We then can examine  why  capital structure matters – because of taxes? transaction costs?  

General result for economic (and ﬁnance) theory: useful for pushing us to think about  how  and  why  the world works as it does  

•  We should see “Capital Structure doesn’t matter” (M&M Prop 1) •  If it does matter, why? •  Some answers: interest taxes distort markets; bankruptcy is costly; information asymmetry

# Modigliani & Miller Proposition 1  

M&M Prop 1: Value is Unchanged by Capital Structure  

•  Total Value of the Firm  $=\mathsf{P V}$   of CFs •  This does not depend on choice of capital structure  

We will see how this works by  

•  Looking at how ﬁrm carves up CFs with debt & equity •  Changes risk of debt  $\&$   equity CFs •  Does not change risk of overall CFs •  See that investors can recombine CFs in any way they want •  Investors can produce any risk proﬁle they want, at no cost •  Investors won’t pay the ﬁrm extra to carve up CFs.  

Result: Capital Structure won’t change value (M&M Prop 1)  
# Capital Structure Carves CFs  

# CFs carved between debt and equity holders  

Start from bottom   $(\mathsf{F i r m\ C F s})$  ), go ﬁrst to Debt, then Equity  

 !500  

How CFs distributed make  huge  di!erence in CF risk  

Debt less risky than equity  

CFs go ﬁrst to debt – if there is any money debt gets it  

Equity is  residual  – only what is left over  

The residual is always more risky – some chance you get nothing  
# Debt, Equity, Debt / Equity, and Leverage  

Assets  – Total of the ﬁrm, all assets, the overall vale of the ﬁrm  

Equity  – What owners or shareholders put in, what owners can lose Debt  – Borrowings, what owners borrow Owners can choose to borrow (issue debt) – choose  Debt / Equity  ratio  

•  Split overall  Assets  into  Debt  versus  Equity  

# Important Concepts

# “Unwinding” Leverage  

We will play a simple game: the ﬁrm takes CFs apart, we (investors) put them back together Start from bottom (Firm CFs), split into Debt & E

$\mathsf{E x p R e t}=12.5$  , StdDev = 6.45

Macbeth realizes some investors want more return (and risk), so they decide to lever  

•  Argue that investors will pay more (higher stock price)  
# Firm Realizes Investors Want More Risk  

Will investors pay more? Start with same price \$10/share  

•  Shift to 50/50 debt/equity •  Issue \$5,000 debt (  $\mathrm{\Delta}$   interest), repurchase 500 share •  Equity now more risky  

Exercise: what  would  be equity return   $\&$   std dev if share price still \$10

Final Synthesis  
# Conclusion: M&M Proposition 1 – Leverage Irrelevant  

Debt versus Equity is irrelevant  

•  “Do-it-yourself leverage” •  Investors can do or undo whatever the ﬁrm does  

Dependent on  
$\mathbf{1}$   Complete Markets: Investors and ﬁrms trade securities at market prices, equal to PV of future CFs 2  No costs: no taxes, transactions costs, or issuance costs for trading securities  $[^3]$   Financing does not change CFs: a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancing decisions do not change CFs generated by projects, and ﬁnancing does not reveals new information about future CFs  
# WACC as result of Prop 1  

M&M Prop 1 says overall value of the ﬁrm does not depend on debt versus equity  

So now go back to simple game of carving and recombining CFs:  

•  The ﬁrm takes CFs apart, •  We (investors) put them back together  

But “reconstituted CFs” is a portfolio of Debt  $\&$   Equity CFs And we know portfolio return is weighted average of components:  
$$
E R_{p o r t}=\alpha_{1}E R_{1}+\alpha_{2}E R_{2}
$$  
$$
r_{u}=r_{a s s e t s}={\frac{D}{E+D}}r_{D}+{\frac{E}{E+D}}r_{E}
$$

# Expected Returns  

As Debt-Equity ratio increases, expected return on equity increases. Eventually, so does debt (as it becomes more risky)

Capital Structure should be random – no industry patterns  

•  Some industries (inrternet like Google) borrow nothing •  Others (airlines) borrow a lot Why? Don’t throw out theory – use M&M to understand •  Example of economic theory deepening our understanding of the world •  Taxes, bankruptcy costs, information asymmetry

# Interest “Tax Shield”  

Debt provides real CFs – In US (and many others) interest is tax deductible.  

Income with no debt versus some debt

Simple idea: government gives cash: subsidy Recurring story: government actions (well-intention ed) distort markets M&M says “how you slice the pie doesn’t matter”

# M&M with Tax Shield – Gov’t Subsidizes Debt  

M&M Prop 1 says value of ﬁrm does not depend on debt versus equity But we know tax shield has value  

•  The ﬁrm takes CFs apart, •  We (investors) put them back together No taxes: •  Firm CFs  → Debt   $^+$   Equity •  Investors take Debt  $^+$   Equity  $\rightarrow$  Firm CFs Yes taxes, Net out tax shield PV •  Firm CFs  $\mathsf{C F s\to D e b t+E q u i t y+T a x e s}$  •  Investors take Debt  $^+$   Equity  $\rightarrow$  Firm CFs – Taxes For Debt, Gov’t gives some taxes back •  With debt, get CF of tax shield,    $T_{c}\cdot I n t$

# In-Class Exercise: Tax Shield as Government Subsidy – PV Tax Shield  

In M&M (no taxes) there are two slices to the pizza: debt & equity  

•  Taxes: third slice (government) matters because you get cash back on debt  

•  Higher debt    $\rightarrow$  higher ﬁrm value; part of government slice  $\rightarrow$  ﬁrm  

Fun result: PV(tax shield) =  $\mathsf{P V}(\mathsf{t a x\ s h i e l d})=\,T_{c}\cdot D$  

•  Yrly   $\mathsf{C F}=T_{c}\cdot D\cdot r$  , every yr forever (annuity) •  PV Annuity =  $={C F}/{r}={T_{c}}\cdot{D}\cdot{r}/{r}={T_{c}}\cdot{D}$

Why? •  Get \$10,000 from issuing new bond, MV equity down by only \$7,900 Example: Johnson & Johnson (\$mn) – BMA Section 18-1, p 449  

 !500  
# Value of Tax Shield  

MV of debt up by \$10,000mn, but MV of equity only down \$7,900mn.  

PV(tax shield)  $=$   tax rate \* Debt  $(T c^{*}D)=0.21^{*}\S10{,}000=\S2{,}100\mathsf{m n}$  

•  Why    ${\cal T}\!c^{*}\!{\cal D}$   and not    ${\cal T}c^{*}D^{*}r?$   (yearly amount – tax rate \* amount of debt \* interest payment) •  Assume tax (and debt) will be there forever. •  PV perpetuity  $=C F/r$

PV(tax shield)  ↑ as debt  ↑  

•  Argues that ﬁrms should go to  $100\%$   debt-ﬁnanced •  Clearly not true  

Look at Costs of high debt (bankruptcy)  
# Taxes Subsidize Debt, But Firms not All Debt  

We don’t see ﬁrms using all debt  

•  Some industries (inrternet like Google) borrow nothing •  Others (airlines) borrow a lot Need to dig deeper, understand why industries vary •  Example of economic theory deepening our understanding of the world •  Taxes partial, turn to bankruptcy costs, information asymmetry

# What Pushes Away from 100% Debt?  

We don’t see really high debt ratios (in most industries) Good evidence ﬁrms don’t fully exploit tax shield Major reason - cost of debt and cost of  Financial Distress.md) BUT – this is not “Bankruptcy” alone •  Monetary costs associated with bankruptcy itself •  Games played before bankruptcy  
# Bankruptcy  

Bankruptcy is a beautiful thing – part of the power of free markets  

•  Debt is a promise – we all know it may get broken •  Nothing wrong with bankruptcy, when try honestly and fail  

What is bankruptcy?  

•  Shareholders admit that the value of assets less than promises made •  Pass assets to debt-holders – debt holders become new owners  

Simple act of bankruptcy not a “cost” – don’t get confused by  loss in bankruptcy  

•  Enron (p. 465) – at peak stock worth \$60bn+. By end-2001 worthless. •  Not \$60bn “loss” – Enron was worthless at peak (fraud), just didn’t know it. •  Actually some “shorters” did know – huge service for all of us, hard work of ferreting out problems the rest of us are too lazy to uncover  

Bankruptcy is simple and wonderful part of capitalism  
# Financial Distress  

Financial Distress.md) is more the simple Bankruptcy:  

Promises to creditors are honored with di!culty (imposing costs)  

Costs of bankruptcy  

•  Direct costs, such as lawyers, accountants •  Indirect costs – eg customers and employees may leave  

Games – that destroy value – played before bankruptcy  

•  Before, when probability high, substantial costs •  Shareholders try and extract value from debt holders •  Simple transfer would be OK, but this destroys value  
# Bankruptcy Costs  

Bankruptcy can be long, expensive process  

•  Direct costs – Pay lawyers, accountants •  Enron – \$757mn in legal, accounting, other •  Lehman – likely as much as \$1,500mn •  Indirect costs – many – eg customers, employees leave •  Big issue in 2008 ﬁnancial crisis – huge disruption when ﬁnancial ﬁrm goes under  

# Evidence  

•  Di"cult to separate, but cost might something like   $3\%$   of total (book) assets,   $20\%$   of market value of equity •  Best evidence – reluctance of creditors to push insolvent ﬁrms (MV assets  $<\mathsf{M V}$   liabilities) into bankruptcy (transfer assets to creditors) •  Often, creditors would rather have managers and shareholders try to get back to health  
# Financial Distress – Games People Play  

Economics teaches us to think about  Incentives Before bankruptcy, probability high, substantial costs.  

•  Diverging incentives: pushes people to play “games” •  Individually optimal (for shareholders), but destroy ﬁrm value Game 1 – Risk Shifting •  Shareholders take on extra risk Other games •  Failure to contribute equity capital •  Cash in and run •  Play for time Costs of Financial Distress.md)  ↑ with level of debt Costs of Distress vary with type of asset •  Airplanes – physical asset, easy to re-sell, won’t lose value •  Trading franchise – disappears over a weekend (Lehman in 2008)  
# Risk Shifting – Equity as Call  

Powerful idea: Equity is call option on ﬁrm value  

•  Shareholders get proﬁts if Assets   $>$   Debt •  Shareholders walk away for free if Assets   $<$   Debt  

From seminal paper by Merton (1974) – Corporate debt as put option  

 !500  

Stock – call option “hockey stick” – Long  

•  Assets   $<\mathtt{B}$   (debt) shareholders get 0 •  Assets   $>\mathtt{B}$  , shareholders get upside Bond – put option “hockey stick” – Short •  Assets   $<\mathtt{B}$   bond holders get assets •  Assets   $>\mathtt{B}$   bond holders get repaid B Nothing “unfair” about this; Up-front PV reﬂects option values  

•  But provides incentive for games around B (bankruptcy)  
# Option Value  ↑ as Volatility  ↑  

Stock: Long Call; Bond: Short Put: Option value  ↑ as Volatility  ↑  

 !500  

See this looking at: •  Black-Scholes option formula – •  Assets just  $<\mathtt{B}$  : I win if  $\uparrow$  , you lose if  ↓ Shareholders want to increase volatility: Call  ↑ , Put  ↓ Example: Assets  $<\mathtt{B}$  , but interest not due for another year  

•  Shareholders can take on negative NPV project that has slight chance of moving Assets > B •  Destroys value, but shareholders have nothing to lose  
# Risk Shifting Example  

“Circular File Co.”: Owe debt \$50: insolvent now but debt due next year  

•  Bonds worth   $\S25$   (  $<$   promised \$50) – need option model to get value  

 !500  

 !500  

Negative NPV Project:   $£_{10}$   investment,   $10\%$   chance \$120,  $90\%$   lose   $\S3.56$  ;  

•  EV = \$8.80  $\mathsf{E V}=\S8.80$  

•  Disc   $10\%$  ,   $\mathsf{E P V}=\mathfrak{H}8$  

Shareholders do it  

•    $10\%$   win: get \$80: 120 + 10 (existing) – 50 (debt)  

•    $90\%$   lose: get zero anyway  

Destroy \$2 worth of ﬁrm value – but shareholders better o!  
# Other Games  

Failure to contribute equity capital  

•  Flip side to “Risk Shifting” – do not invest in positive NPV project – because not enough to push Assets   $>{\tt B}$   (won’t dig ﬁrm out of the hole) Cash in and Run •  Try to suck cash out •  Bankruptcy court can claw back  fraudulent conveyance  – but subtle ways to extract cash Play for Time •  Delay bankruptcy and hope something good will happen •  Meantime, assets waste away  
# Debt versus Distress  

Debt  ↑  $\Rightarrow$  tax savings  ↑ , but also prob of bankruptcy  ↑ (moves up    $B$  , bankruptcy threshold)  

 !500  

 !500  

 !500  

Tradeo! between tax beneﬁts   $\&$   bankruptcy costs  Easy-to-sell assets (lower cost in bankruptcy) should have higher debt  

Compare computer businesses (assets  $=$   human capital that can walk – low debt) vs airlines (planes easy to sell – high debt)  

Explains many observations  

•  Industry di!erences – high-tech vs airlines  

But not complete story – many successful ﬁrms use little debt  

•  Southwest Airlines, largely equity-ﬁnanced (2009)

Final Synthesis  
# Asymmetric Information Pushes to Debt  

Asymmetric Information: ﬁrm cannot transmit information believably Two ﬁrms:  Jones, Inc.  (optimistic) and  Smith & Co.  (pessimistic)  

•  Jones has trouble convincing investors (all ﬁrms say good things) Now they want to raise capital. Round 1: •  Jones (optimistic) sells debt since equity is “under priced” •  Smith (pessimistic) issues equity since it is “overpriced” Round 2: •  Investors take information from Smith, realize equity overpriced Round 3: •  Smith sells debt instead, since selling equity would be bad-news signal  

Result:  Both ﬁrms pushed towards debt  
# End Result – “Pecking Order”  

Firms prefer internal ﬁnance – reinvesting earnigns so don’t have to issue new equity

  If have to raise external ﬁnance, start with debt, then equity as last resort

# Final Synthesis  

Neither “Trade-o!” nor “Pecking Order” are perfect  

Some evidence by Raghuram Rajan & Luigi Zingales (Booth), found 4 factors matter:  
$\mathbf{1}$   Size : Large ﬁrms higher debt ( Trade-o" ) 2  Tangible Assets : more ﬁxed assets, higher debt ( Trade-o" ) 3  Pro t ability : more proﬁtable, lower debt ( Pecking Order , can use internal)  $[^4]$   Market-to-Book : higher market-to-book, lower debt  

Not perfect, but we have come a long way in understanding capital markets using our assumption of “Perfect Capital Markets”

# 1 E!cient Markets and Random Walks  

# Contents  

How to Think About Financial Prices: Changes or Levels Known : Price today    $P_{0}$  Unknown : Price tomorrow    $P_{1}$  Unknown  Change    $\varepsilon=P_{1}-P_{0}$  We know    $P_{0}$  , but both    $P_{1}$   and    $\varepsilon$   are unknown (RVs or Random Variables) • Say we want to forecast    $P_{1}$   (buy if    $P_{1}$   higher) • Should we try to forecast    $P_{1}$   (price tomorrow)? or    $\varepsilon$   (changes)? Natural temptation: Forecast    $P_{1}$   directly • Actually wrong • Far better to think about change from today to tomorrow,    $\Delta$  Level :    $P_{1}$  Change    $\varepsilon=P_{1}-P_{0}$  
# Changes & “E!cient Market”  

Working with changes    $\varepsilon=P_{1}-P_{0}$   forces us to think about  New Information  

• Why is tomorrow’s price di!erent (from today)? • Fundamental idea: because of new information  

Old news shows up in old price (  $P_{0}$  )  

• Why wait, why not use existing news (today) in existing price (today)  

Saying something important about markets  

[^1]: You can make money using more and better information than others 2. There are many people trying to make money (by using information) 3. So information gets used quickly

There is no (or very little) “left over” information that is not used today • Only “new information” changes tomorrows price  

# “E!cient Markets” or Random Walk: People Trying to Make Money  

• People try to make money • So use information quickly • So only new information changes price • All of today’s information in today’s price  

 !500  

This is (or was) a pretty revolutionary idea  

• A big surprise, discovered by various people, at various times • Maurice Kendall in 1953, Louis Bachellier in 1900, French broker Jules Regnault in 1863  

Makes sense – at least for liquid markets with lots of people and lots of money • Not so true for obscure markets – say eBay for egg coddlers

# 2 Random Walks and Simple Econometrics  

# Contents  

Simple Random Walk: Easy But Often Fools Us Known : Price today    $P_{0}$  Unknown : Price tomorrow    $P_{1}$  Unknown  Change    $\varepsilon=P_{1}-P_{0}$  Random walk is simplest statistical model for changes    $\varepsilon$  • Flip a coin: –  heads: go up,  ω  = +1;    $P_{1}=P_{0}+1$  ; –  tails: go down,  ω  =  → 1;    $P_{1}=P_{0}-1$  Simplest statistical model for Price change (today to tomorrow) • Change completely random • Cannot forecast change  
# Amazing: Random Walk Looks Like “Bull & Bear” Markets  

Random Walk: ﬂip a coin: heads go   $+1$  , tails go  $-1$

• Anyone would swear there are trends – Bull markets, Bear markets  

• But completely random  

# Easy to be Fooled by Random Walks – Spurious Correlation  

Random Walks fool us in many ways Bad enough being fooled into “seeing” market trends • Can be even worse when try to uncover relations among random walks  

Say we want to test whether bonds and equities move together  

• First idea: Regress equities vs bonds:  
$$
P_{t}^{b o n d}=\alpha+\beta\cdot P_{t}^{e q u i t y}+\varepsilon_{t}
$$  

• If you’re not careful with statistics, you get completely misled  

# Spurious Regression / Correlation – Simulation  

So let’s run a simulation: generate simulated  $P_{t}^{e q u i t y}\ \&\ P_{t}^{b o n d}$  (200 obs, 200 “months”):  
$$
P_{t}^{e q u i t y}=P_{t-1}^{e q u i t y}+\varepsilon_{t}\;\;\;\varepsilon\sim N(0,4)\quad\qquad P_{t}^{b o n d}=P_{t-1}^{b o n d}+\nu_{t}\;\;\;\nu\sim N(0,1)
$$  

then run regression  $P_{t}^{b o n d}=\alpha+\beta\cdot P_{t}^{e q u i t y}+u_{t}$   · , and repeat many times (1000 separate regressions) •  RStudio Notebook  Sim Random Walk 1. Rmd  &  .nb.html  on Canvas ( ﬁles )  

Textbooks tell us that   $5\%$   of our sample (50 regressions)   $\mathrm{t}$  -ratio  $\frac{{\hat{\beta}}-0}{S E}$    should be large (outside of ± 1 . 972 ) This regression shows wildly di!erent results: The simulation has   ${\bf85\%}$   outside the bands  

• The theory is wildly wrong for these random walks – it simply does not apply •  Technical issue:    $\varepsilon_{t}$   not independent – violates regression assumptions  

Random walks are  not  well-behaved – never ever run levels regressions for random walks  

• Originally discussed by Granger and Newbold, 1974.  Spurious regressions in econometrics . Journal of Econometrics. see also https://davegiles.blogspot.com/2015/10/illustratingspurious-regressions.html  
 !500  
Spurious Correlations – Levels, Trends, and Random Walks  

Note the trend – both are going down  

• Probably for completely unrelated reasons  

• But the downward trends dominate  

# And Random Walks are  Everywhere  

One of the primary instances: Financial Prices  

•    $P_{t+1}=P_{t}+\varepsilon_{t+1}$  : tomorrow’s price is today plus  new  information • If you have information today you’re going to use it now – if you wait you will lose money • All today’s information (  $\nu_{t}$  ) is put into today’s price • Tomorrow’s price depends only on  new  information  

Many (most) economic times series (GDP, prices, employment, on-and-on) behave very much like random walks  

• Tomorrow’s value is today’s plus a random component  

# What To Do? Regress First Di"erence or   $\%$   Change  

So what do we do, given our simulations? (the level regression    $Y_{t}=\alpha+\beta X_{t}+e_{t}$   is wildly wrong) Never, ever, run economic time-series in levels  – always   $\%$   change or di!erence:  
$$
Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}=\alpha+\beta\left(X_{t}-X_{t-1}\right)+e_{t}
$$  

• Not quite true – you want to examine whether your economic time-series is (close to) a random walk • Unemployment rate, for example, does not look like a random walk. But employment (number of people) does • John Cochrane (a really good economist, now at Hoover at Stanford) has a good blog post: https://john h cochrane.blogspot.com/2015/04/unit-roots-redux.html  
# Contents  

[^1]: -Slide Introduction to Time-Series Econometrics Huge area of statistics, econometrics, economics • Many, many economic time-series are random walks, or close Some facts and terminology – Auto regressions • Many economic time-series well-described by    $X_{t}=\rho\cdot X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t}$  –    $\varepsilon_{t}$   random (say Normal),    $\rho$   close to 1 • When    $\rho=1$   Random Walk –    $\varepsilon_{t}$   is completely new information –  Unit Root – changes (  $\varepsilon_{t}$  ) random and independent –  Correlation between    $X_{t}-X_{t-1}\,\&\,X_{t+1}-X_{t}$   is zero • When    $\rho\approx1$   then new information dies, transitory –  But close to 1 is almost RW, still have problems Most Important: • Never blindly run regressions in levels • Always think about di!erences

We want to test whether they are related – whether    $Y$   (equities) move down when    $X$   (bonds) move up  

• Test the coe"cient, in this case -0.09758 (negative) • Textbooks tell us that for a well-behaved regression, the distribution is Student $t$   (and the regression program calculates the standard error) • We ask “IF the true    $\beta$   were   $0$  , how far away is our  $\hat{\beta}=-0.097583$  ?” • Like the mean,  $\begin{array}{r}{\frac{\beta-0}{S E}=\frac{-.09758}{.02553}=-3.822\sim t_{n-2}\approx N(0,1)}\end{array}$   (here    $n$  -2=198) • Far out in left tail – minute probability we would see –.09758 if    $\beta=0$  • But we know    $\beta=0$   – Maybe we were just unlucky – this can happen  

# 3 Returns and Normality  

# Contents  

Percent Changes For ﬁnancial markets and asset prices, always use percent change • Been talking about “changes”    $\varepsilon=P_{1}-P_{0}$  But for ﬁnancial markets, need either • changes in logs:    $\varepsilon=\ln\left(P_{1}\right)-\ln\left(P_{0}\right)=\ln\left(P1/_{P0}\right)$  •   $\%$   change:    $\varepsilon=P1\big/P0-1$  These are more-or-less the same (for modest changes) • Logs:    $\ln\left(^{102}\!\!/_{100}\right)=.0198$  •   $\%$  :    $102\big/100-1=.02$

# Normal Distribution  

Always work with changes:    $\varepsilon=\%$   change  

• Cannot say what price change will be, but can think about range of values • What is distribution of    $\varepsilon$  ? Generally, looks like: • Horizontal: CF or return in future • Vertical: probability or likelihood –  Technically: picture is density  

Often work with Normal Distribution  

• Classic bell-shaped, like in picture. Depends on  only  µ  &  ς • Works somewhat OK in ﬁnance – but many problems (fat tails!!)  

But we care about the whole distribution (not just    $\mu\,\&\,\sigma$  )  
# Normal Works OK, Not Perfect

•    $\mu=0.024\%$  ,    $\sigma=1.417\%$   (log changes) • Histogram, overlaid with normal • Not too bad – Good as a start

# Normality Problems: Fat Tails  

Normal is an OK start, in middle part of distribution  

• But really bad in tails  

Consider daily changes in Dow Jones, 50 years 1954-2004  

• Extreme events more common than predicted by normal  

• Hear people say “we had a 5- !¨  day”. They mean “a move larger than expected, given the normal distribution”  

Play following game:  

• Build normal distribution, based on mean & variance (  $O$  ) for all 50 years  

• Look only at very left tail  

• Examine just those ten largest far out in the tail  

Normal does  very  badly  

• Many more large moves   $(4\sigma,\,5\sigma)$   than predicted Coleman • Need other distributions:    $t.$  -distribution, mixture of normals

# Believe in Markets  

In general, if you see a market price you should believe it  

• If you think the market is wrong, think again. Then think again • There are hundreds or thousands or millions of people looking at that price, and if they don’t think it’s wrong then you had better have a good reason  

Think carefully about your comparative advantage – are you really smarter than everyone else? • Could be, but you are saying you are smarter than all the others E"cient Markets come down to “The Wisdom of Crowds” • The market may not always be right, but be careful betting against it  

Old joke – professor & student see   $\S{100}$  , professor says “can’t be with e"cient markets” Aside on “shorting” – valuable – part of making markets e"cient  

• People putting their money on the line  

# Abnormal Returns – Example of E!cient Markets  

Price changes for sample of ﬁrms targets of takeover attempts  

• Firm    $A$   buys Firm    $B$  , alway pays  more  than pre-takeover price • Good news about Firm    $B\mathrm{~-~}\mathrm{~F~}$  irm    $A$   believes    $B$   is valuable – and will pay extra • Graph shows for “B” ﬁrms before and after announcement  

Evidence that markets are “e"cient” – build in new information quickly  

• Good news into prices almost immediately • After announcement – no new information (on average – some ﬁrms good, some bad) • Why drift up before?  Insider trading  – news leaks out

# Information Goes In Quickly  

Stocks mentioned on CNBC “Midday Call”  

• Positive – jump up within seconds, stabilizes within 5 min • Negative – takes longer, but stabilizes within 12 min  

Markets so competitive (so many investors scrambling to make money) everything happens quickly • Why longer for negative? Di"cult and expensive to short-sell stocks

Green, “Market E"ciency in Real Time,”  Journal of Financial Economics  65 (2002) p. 422  

# Weak, Semi-Strong, Strong: Private Information  

Three forms of Market E"ciency:  

[^1]: Weak: Past Price Information: Current prices reﬂect information in past prices (impossible to make consistent proﬁts using past  prices ) – prices follow random walk 2. Semi-Strong: All Public Information: Current prices reﬂect  all  public information (news reports, etc.) 3. Strong:  All  Information, Public & Private

I was a little skeptical of Strong Form, but here’s an extraordinary example  

• “The stock market speaks: How Dr. Alchian learned to build the bomb”  Journal of Corporate Finance  2014 • 1954, top-secret hydrogen bomb testing.  No  public information on what element used (was lithium) • Aremen A. Alchian used stock market prices to discover that it was lithium –  Found that stock price of company producing and selling lithium went up more than other companies  

In the end – idea of market e"ciency / competitiveness – more important than exact form

# History – Always use Returns (Changes)  

When looking at history, always look at  changes , never the price • We care about uncertainty of cash ﬂows, and it is the  changes  that are uncertain and random  

Use  returns    $\begin{array}{r}{\%=\frac{P_{t}-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}}\end{array}$  to adjust for size of price or wealth →  

• Example: S&P 2008, 2009, 2010 (end-of-year)  

Prices versus Returns •  Changes  are the new & random part

Returns normalize for size  

[^2007]: 1468.36 1967: 96.47 •   $1\ \%$   change means same change per \$1 invested

# Prices & Returns from Problem  

ALWAYS look at price changes or returns – when measuring means, standard deviations • The  change  in price is the new or random part  

Use    $\begin{array}{r}{\%=\frac{P_{t}-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}}\end{array}$  to adjust for size of investment → Quotes and Prices for UST and S&P Futures  

 !500  

# 2 – Trust Market Prices  

You may be smarter than everyone else,  

• But think carefully whether you are smarter than all the other millions of investors  
# 3 – “Read the Entrails”  

Use information in market prices  

• We have been doing this with bonds, spread • Using market prices to back out discount rate and risk premium  

Verizon & Bank of America example – in 2010  

• Verizon 7.375% of 9/12, rated A/A3, spread of 64bp • BAC 4.88% of 1/13, rated A/A2, spread of 207bp  

• Trust the market spread  

Another example: mortgage-backed AAA CDOs in 2005 – trading at 80bp spread versus corporates at maybe 20bp  

• CDO - Collateralized Debt Obligation –  Package mortgages together, parcel out CFs to  equity ,  mezzanine ,  senior  tranches –  If mortgages stop paying, equity & mezzanine lose CFs ﬁrst • Clearly people in the market knew that mortgage-backed structures were not really AAA.  

# 4 – Do-It-Yourself Alternative  

Investors will not pay others for what they can do themselves  

• Basis of Modigliani & Miller “Capital Structure Irrelevance” – investors will not pay extra for arranging debt versus equity because investors can do it – buy bonds & equity  

Companies often justify mergers because it provides “divers i cation” • Investors can get divers i cation more cheaply – buy equities or mutual funds  

# 5 – No Financial Illusions  

Investors care about company CFs, not what company says  

• Investors generally pretty smart • See through games companies play  

Example – companies manage earnings, trying to make things look good  

• Investors usually see through this

# 7 Modigliani & Miller Prop 1 – Capital Structure Irrelevance (BMA Ch 17)  

# Contents  

Important Idea – Debt vs Equity in Firm Capital Structure Does Not Matter Companies have part debt, part equity • FIS Assets: \$63.3bn; Debt: \$35.9bn (57%); Equity \$27.4bn (43%) Modigliani-Miller says total ﬁrm value does not depend on what percent debt, what percent equity Read “lecture 12b” for more detail  
What Are “Perfect Capital Markets”? What do we mean by “Perfect” Capital Markets? (and “E"cient” Markets)? •  NOT  “good” in a normative sense – specialized or technical meaning of “theoretical ideal or starting point” • Nor “realistic” as in how markets actually behave Three assumptions: 1. Complete Markets: Investors and ﬁrms trade securities at market prices, equal to PV of future CFs 2. No costs: no taxes, transactions costs, or issuance costs for trading securities 3. Financing does not change CFs: a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancing decisions do not change CFs generated by projects, and ﬁnancing does not reveals new information about future CFs  

# Value of “Perfect Markets”  

These assumptions clearly not realistic. Why is the whole idea useful? • We get strong results: M&M Prop 1: capital structure – debt vs equity – does not matter • We then can examine  why  capital structure matters – because of taxes? transaction costs?  

General result for economic (and ﬁnance) theory: useful for pushing us to think about  how  and why  the world works as it does

• Auction: US Treasuries always; equities rarely  

Some details:  

• Equities and bonds usually issued through brokered market, with an investment bank acting as broker.  

–  We will cover more detail about how equities are issued shortly  

• US Government bonds are issued through an auction mechanism – the US Treasury provides a list of what securities are being issued, and primary dealers then give prices they would buy at, until all securities are sold  

• State and local bonds, corporate bonds, foreign bonds (such as bonds issued by Brazil in the international market) are all brokered by commercial or investment banks

# Types of Markets  

 !500  

• Direct Search  

–  Something like Craigslist or advertising for a used car –  individual buyers and sellers seeking each other directly. –  One-o! transaction and products tend to be heterogeneous (each di!erent) – no economies of scale in specializing  
• Brokered  

–  A person or company specializes in bringing together buyers and sellers –  Could be either illiquid and heterogeneous or liquid and homogeneous ∗BKM give example of real estate. But this is still very illiquid (irregular) and heterogeneous ∗Many ﬁnancial markets are brokered, but liquid and homogeneous – Swaps are liquid and homogeneous –  Brokered markets generally have a  fee  or commission – the buyer or seller (or both) pay a fee to the broker –  Example: Swaps  

• Dealer  

–  Dealer specializes in trading a speciﬁc security or asset or type of asset –  Buys and sells for own account – will buy from a customer and sell to a customer directly, not arranging a transaction with another customer –  Stands ready to buy from or sell to customer –  Buys from customer at low price (Bid) and sells at high price (o!er)  

–  Example: Bonds, FX  

• Auction  

–  Buyers and sellers get together in centralize exchange –  Used to be a physical location, now electronic –  Examples: NY Stock Exchange, CME futures exchange – Movie “Trading Places” has scene of pit (auction) trading in Orange Juice futures  

# How Investors Buy and Sell  

 !500  

Investors will buy and sell for many reasons  

• Long-term investment  

–  Retirement –  Future spending (saving for children’s education, looking after one’s parents)  

• Short-term cash  
–  Corporations or individuals or governments may have cash now that they will use some short period in the future, need to invest somewhere for short period.  

–  May put it in a bank, but could also buy a bond or equity for a short period Investors almost always go through a broker, broker/dealer, or bank  

• Individuals, corporations, retirement or mutual funds will almost never deal in the market directly but have a broker act on their behalf • A broker would be someone like Interactive Brokerage, Vanguard Broker Services, Fidelity,  $\mathrm{E^{*}}$  Trade, Charles Schwab –  The most basic allow you to buy and sell equities. More sophisticated will provide services in equities, bonds, FX, futures. Domestic and international. • The broker will execute in the appropriate market on behalf of the investor  

# Equity Markets (Primary vs Secondary)

Distinguish between Primary (where companies issue new securities) and Secondary (where investors invest in securities already issued).

–  Companies issue the securities and raise the money from investors –  Almost always brokered, with an investment bank handling the details of required regulatory ﬁlings, pricing, ﬁnding investors, etc.  

• Secondary market  

–  The original company is not involved –  Investors buy and sell the securities to invest and re-arrange their investments – to manage their portfolio –  For large public equities (Apple, IBM, Starbucks) it is auction market – buyers and sellers meet and negotiate price and quantity. e.g. NY Stock Exchange –  For small, privately issued securities it may be a brokered or dealer market  
 !500  
Bond (and FX) Markets  

Dealer market, with dealer earning Bid/O!er spread (buy low bid price, sell high o!er price) rather than commission  

Bond (and FX) markets virtually always dealer market  

• Banks, investment banks, and confusingly often called brokers – buy and sell themselves, • Stand ready to buy from and sell to customers. –  Dealer chooses the price – will buy low (Bid Price) and sell high (O!er or Ask Price)

# 2 How Corporations Issue Equity  

[^2]: 1 Overview & Early Stage

# Contents  

Ch. 15 of [Brealey et al.(2013)Brealey, Myers, and Allen] is more about equity funding than about issuing securities. Refers almost entirely to equity issues. We will go over this brieﬂy. We don’t have time to cover this in detail, but BMA is good so you can read to get detail  

# Three Stages of Equity Funding  

[^1]: Venture Capital or Angel Investors and private funding – not publicly traded securities 2. IPO – Initial Public O!ering – the ﬁrst sale of securities to the public for a ﬁrm not publicly traded 3. SEO – Seasoned Equity O!ering – sale of securities to the public for an existing publiclytraded ﬁrm
Private Funding, Angel Investors, and Venture Capital Can be simple – raise funds from small, non-public, group – no public securities • At the simplest level this is family and friends. • Other outside investors often called Angel Investors • For a small start-up not necessary, but often good idea, to formalize with articles of incorporation and by-laws • Such formality necessary when money from outside enters. Venture Capital: • Equity provided by outside investors • In the form of shares that are not publicly traded  

# Private Funding, Angel Investors, and Venture Capital  

Very simple – raise funds from small, non-public, group – no public securities  

• At the simplest level this is family and friends. –  The hedge fund I started in London fell into this category – the three founders put up the original equity. We got shares proportional to funds we put in. • Other outside investors are often called Angel Investors • For a small start-up it is not necessary, but it is often a very good idea, to formalize arrangements with articles of incorporation and by-laws that specify shares and how they can be traded, redeemed, etc. This saves many headaches later. It is, ironically, most important when things go really well. Fights really start when there’s lots of money to ﬁght over – if things go badly and everyone loses money it’s bad luck but there tends to be less spoils to ﬁght over. • Such formality becomes an absolute necessity when money from outside friends and family enters. Venture Capital is equity provided by outside investors, but in the form of shares that are not publicly traded.  

# Venture Capital Investors  

Firms that provide funding to young and start-up companies.  

• Focus on companies that have a chance to grow spectacularly – next Google, Apple, ...  

VC often second stage, after founders put their own money in  

• Need additional equity to continue or expand  

VC investors generally pay close attention  

• Require strict and formal agreements  

VC investor shares not publicly traded, don’t have to registered with SEC  

Venture Capital Investors  

• Term used to describe ﬁrms that provide funding to young and start-up companies. VC investors focus on companies that have a chance to grow spectacularly. VC investors are constantly looking out for the next Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. But VC not limited just to technology business.  
• VC investment is often a second stage, after the founders have put their own money in and when they need additional equity to continue or expand.  

–  With my hedge fund we had a 2nd stage investor. We started our company in 1998, then in 2001/02 we wanted to expand and we found a large hedge fund willing to invest in us. We didn’t call it VC, but it had all the characteristics we’re talking about here – selling a share of the company to a new investor who was closely involved in out ﬁrm.  

• VC investors will generally pay close attention to the ﬁrm – not a hands-o! investment. Require strict and formal agreements, specifying conditions to be met, further funding parameters, etc. Generally requires a seat on the board or a say in the management.  

• Shares sold to VC investors will not be publicly traded, and don’t have to registered with SEC.  

# Selling Shares to VC  

• Injects new capital  

• Dilutes existing shareholders  

• Sets value on company  

Example of “Marvin Enterprises”  

• Initial investment (founders): \$100,000 for 1mn shares  

• 2nd stage VC ﬁrm Meriam Venture Partners \$1mn,  

–  1mn shares at \$1 each.  

Now the ﬁrm was 50/50 owned by founders and Meriam – 1mn shares each  

Balance sheet after 2nd stage ﬁnancing

Selling shares to VC Investors sets value on company, and sets value of existing shares  

• Example of “Marvin Enterprises”  

–  Initial investment was   $\S100{,}000$   for   $\S$  1mn shares. –  2nd stage investment from VC ﬁrm Meriam Venture Partners was   $\S$  1mn, in the form of 1mn shares at \$1 each. –  Note that now the ﬁrm was 50/50 owned by founders and Meriam – 1mn shares each

# Initial Public O!erings  

SEC and Securities Act  

• “Registration” of securities that are o!ered to the public  

# IPOs – Initial Public O!erings – ﬁrst o!er of securities to the public  

This is where we, the public, start to get involved. It is also where regulations and legal issues become very important  

• As a result of the last ﬁnancial crisis (the 1929-33 Depression, not the 2008-2009 crises) there was a whole set of regulations and institutions enacted to protect investors. There are two particularly important sets of regulations that govern issuance and trading of securities in the US:  

–  Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act" - SEC) –  State "blue sky" laws (state-by-state regulations governing o!ering of securities)  

• SEC and Securities Act  

–  This is the big one. –  The SEC requires “registration” of securities that are o!ered to the public.  

∗There are some exceptions if a small number of knowledgeable or sophisticated investors (35 or less). These are called Reg D o!erings (o!ered under Regulation D). They can sometimes be traded among large ﬁnancial institutions under Rule 144A.  

–  The idea behind registration is to provide disclosure and transparency. The SEC has nothing to say about whether the security o!ering is “good” in the sense of a good investment, only that the o!ering discloses all relevant information.  

–  This is an incredibly important point. The SEC makes no ruling on the quality of the investment. You can never get in trouble with the SEC for a stupid start-up idea. But the SEC insists on disclosing all relevant and material information. When you hear about someone getting in trouble with the SEC it is often on failure to disclose material information. (The SEC also goes after outright fraud, but we’ll put that to the side for the moment – assume that everyone here is basically honest and not out to pull a Mado!-type Ponzi scheme.)  
 !500  

Main steps in traditional IPO in US (from [Brealey et al.(2013)Brealey, Myers, and Allen] table 15.2)  

[^1]: Company appoints underwriters 2. Fees: spread (typically 7  $\%$  ) and gumshoe option ( underwriters can get additional   $15\%$   shares) 3. Prepare SEC registration and issue preliminary prospectus (red herring) 4. Roadshow to market to potential customers. Build book by soliciting indications of interest 5. SEC approval (SEC rules on disclosure, not quality of the issue). Company and underwriters agree on issue price 6. Underwriters allocate shares (usually over-allocation) 7. Trading starts. Underwriters cover the over-allocation by buying in the market and exercising gumshoe option 8. Managing underwriter makes liquid market in stock and provides research coverage

# SEC registration and state blue-sky laws  

• An incredibly cumbersome and legalistic process that produces a document that nobody except lawyers read. • But the beneﬁt of this process is that it requires any new issuer to disclose material information, and provides severe (and well-enforced) penalties if relevant information is not disclosed. This is one of those situations where nobody reads the registration document, but its existence ensures good behavior. • The most important part of the registration statement is the Prospectus. Very much shortened example in appendix to Ch. 15. • Also must ensure o!ering complies with state laws – blue-sky laws that regulate o!ering and sale of securities within a state. • Generally, but not always, if comply under federal securities regulation will also comply under state laws. But not always – example of Apple IPO in 1980 when Mass regulators didn’t allow sales to individuals in Mass because Apple was too risky. Stupid, but there you go. • Historically, state and federal laws had duplication. Much duplication, particularly on securities registration, removed in 1996.  
• Term “blue-sky” refers to fraudulent investments that are backed by nothing but so many feet of blue sky.  

# Underwriting, Road Show, and Book building  

• Most IPOs in the US are done as underwritten issues under the following process:  

–  Company chooses a set of investment banks as underwriters who agree to buy the shares from the company at a pre-agreed price, and then sell them to the public. –  The underwriters agree to support the price in the market for a period of time by buying shares back from the public.  

• Once the registration statement has been submitted to the SEC (but before approval) the underwriters will go on a Road Show, talking to potential investors  

• Investors provide indications of interest where they say how many shares they will buy at what price.  

• The process of collecting indications and allocation shares is called Book building. • Managing underwriter commits to make liquid market and provide research coverage.  

# Price Setting and Sale  

SEC approval, the underwriters set price and allocate shares  

• Price is usually set at a discount to where everyone thinks it will actually sell  

• Strong incentive to ensure the issues sell  

• Shares on IPOs usually rise from. Price rises sometimes substantial  

Why? Why use such a cumbersome process and leave so much money on the table?  

• Google in 2004 raised \$1.4bn in an auction.  

• Why don’t others?  

I don’t have a good answer.  

• But, I want to be careful – maybe I don’t know enough  

Many IPOs involve founders selling a small number of their own shares to the public  

• May be a private incentive for the founders: raise less money for the ﬁrm, increase private wealth  

# Price Setting and Sale  

• When SEC approval is obtained, the underwriters set a price and allocate shares to investors at that price.  

–  Price is usually set at a discount to where everyone thinks it will actually sell –  Strong incentive on the part of the investment banks to ensure the issues sell – both for their own reputation and so they don’t get stuck with unsold shares – remember they’ve underwritten the issue and bought the shares from the company at the pre-agreed price so the risk resides with the investment bank.  

• They then sell shares to the public.  

• Shares on IPOs almost invariably rise from their o!er price, at least initially. These prices rises can be really substantial  
• This raises an important question – why use such a cumbersome process, that seems to ensure under pricing and that the ﬁrm will raise less money than they could have if they had o!ered the shares to the public in an auction.  

–  Google in 2004 raised \$1.4bn in an auction. –  Why don’t others? –  I don’t have a good answer. Seems to me the existing process is rife with ine"ciencies and conﬂicts-of-interest. Note that managing underwriter provides research as part of the package, but how can the research be independent when it is part of the IPO package? –  But, I want to be careful – I don’t have enough experience and knowledge about IPOs to make a deﬁnitive statement. There may be issues around asymmetric information and signaling (the issuers have information that the public cannot have, and under-pricing may provide some signal about the quality of the issue). E"cient markets actually require people to put in time and e!ort to uncover information and set prices, and there is some evidence that the book building process is better at building information than an auction. –  Also, many IPOs involve founders selling a small number of their own shares to the public and holding onto most of their shares, so that there may be a private incentive for the founders to raise less money for the ﬁrm but have their own wealth (in terms of continued holdings of shares) increase.  

[^2]: 3Secondary O!erings – Seasoned Equity O!er or SEO

# Contents  

General Cash O!ers vs Rights O!ers  

# Seasoned Equity O!er or SEO  

US: General Cash O!ers – that is sale to everyone and anyone • Essentially same as IPO – underwriter, SEC registration, underwriter roadshow and bookbuilding, ...  

• Same problems with under pricing and conﬂicts-of-interest as with IPO. • Shelf registration – important innovation – SEC’s Rule 415 Additional problem – asymmetric information, overpricing, and announcement e!ect  

# Seasoned Issues – Seasoned Equity O!er or SEO  

• In the US most SEOs are done as General Cash O!ers – that is sale to everyone and anyone.  
• Process is essentially the same as for IPO – underwriter, SEC registration, underwriter roadshow and book building, underwriter buys shares from company at agreed price and sells to public.  

• Same problems with under pricing and conﬂicts-of-interest as with IPO.  

• Shelf registration – important innovation – SEC’s Rule 415 allows a single registration that applies over a period for a range of o!erings. Allows ﬂexibility and lower cost – don’t have to register each time.  

• Additional problem – asymmetric information, overpricing, and announcement e!ect  

• The issuing ﬁrm has better information than outsiders.  

• If the ﬁrm has information that future prospects are better than the market believes, the share price will be “too low” – lower than it should be if the market knew the better future prospects. In such a case the ﬁrm will not want to issue shares because they will raise less than they should, and the low price will favor new shareholders and hurt existing shareholders (the new shareholders get the shares at a bargain price) NB – Rights o!er will solve problem of disadvantaging existing shareholders (since rights given to existing shareholders, and they can sell the rights) but will not solve the asymmetric information (share under pricing) issue.  

• The ﬁrm could try and inform investors – make an announcement that future prospects are good. But investors will not believe this because it is the kind of thing ﬁrms say all the time.  

• If the ﬁrm has information that future prospects are worse than the market believes, the price will be “too high” – higher than it should be, and the ﬁrm will want to issue.  

• Bottom line – ﬁrms will issue shares when they have information (not available to or not correctly understood by outsiders) that the share price is “too high”. Investors will know this and thus any equity issue will be interpreted as a signal that prospects are worse than embedded into the current price. Result – the price will fall in response to a new equity issue.  

# Alternative to General Cash O!er – Rights O!er  

• Rights O!ers almost never used in the US, but almost always used (sometimes legally required) overseas.  

• Rights issues give existing shareholders the right of ﬁrst refusal. Each existing shareholder is given the right to buy a certain number of new shares per existing share  

–  Example in BMA [Brealey et al.(2013)Brealey, Myers, and Allen] of mining company Xstrata. Each existing share given the right to buy two new shares.  

• Key thing here is that rights are priced and can be sold, either to other investors or back to the underwriter.  

• Two e!ects  

–  Existing shareholders get value even if current price “too low”. Protected from the market’s under pricing because they have the right to the new shares. This removes the problem if new issues disadvantaging (diluting) existing shareholders. –  Price for the new shares doesn’t really matter – since existing shareholders have the right to buy at that price they don’t lose if the price is set below the current price. Existing shareholders can either buy the new shares, or sell the rights – either way they are equally well o!.  

• Can calculate new share price by considering total value (original   $^+$   new cash) and dividing by new shares. Rights price is di!erence  
–  Firm wants to raise 4.1bn (pounds). Current stock price is 6.23/share, 976,190 shares –  They could set various combinations of Price New and N Rights (Price New is the price per share for the new shares, and N Rights is the number of rights given to each existing share – each Right can buy one new share) as long as Pnew\*Nrights\*Nshares = total amount to raise –  For example, they actually set   $\mathrm{Pew}\,=\,2.10$   and Nrights = 2. Then   $2.10^{*}2^{*}976{,}190=$  4.1bn. Could also set   $\mathrm{Pew}=4.20$  , Nrights = 1. Then   $4.20^{*}1^{*}976{,}190=4.1\mathrm{{bin}}$  . Or Pnew  $=1.4$  , Nrights = 3, and   $1.4^{*}3^{*}976,190=4.1$  1bn –  New share price: ∗Total Value:  $\mathrm{old~+~New}=6.23\,+\,2^{*}2.10=10.43$  . ∗This is 3 shares, so each share worth 3.48.  $^*$  Rights: New Price – Price Paid = 3.48 – 2.10 = 1.38. –  Existing shareholder is equally well-o! if take up o!er or sell rights: ∗Take up: Start with 6.23, put in 4.20, and end up with 3 shares worth in total 10.43 ∗Sell rights: Start with 6.23, sell rights, end up with 1 share worth 3.48 + cash   $2^{*}1.38$  = 6.24 (o! by 1 because of rounding:   $10.43~/~3=3.476667)$  )  

• Want to set new price below current price, so that the rights actually have value. Issues generally underwritten: investment bank buys from ﬁrm and holds risk that shares not sold.

• Constant growth model  

• Role of terminal value  

• Role of “Investment Opportunities”: when internal prospects (a ﬁrm’s investment opportunities) are better than outside opportunities available to investors, the ﬁrm should plow back funds (retain earnings) and stock price should go up when it does.

# Dividends & Future CFs  

Value for Equities: Ultimately from future CFs  

• Only reason we buy equity today is for future CFs  

People talk about “dividends” (CF) and “capital gains” (selling for higher price)  

• “Dividends” – periodic CFs  

• “Capital Gains” – selling for a higher price in the future  

• But ultimately, someone else buys because they expect future CFs  

• It all comes down to future CFs  

What are  Dividends ?  

• Equities generally pay out cash, quarterly  

• Paid   $\S0.35$   on 14 March 2019 (\$0.32 13-dec-18, \$0.32 13-sep, \$0.32 14-jun)  

•   $\S1.31$   over past year,   $1.13\%$   of price (\$1.31 / \$115.9)  

• Dividend  Rate :   $\S/\mathrm{yr}=\S1.31$  

• Dividend  Yield  (generally more useful):   $\%=\Updownarrow$  dividend / \$price= 1.13%

# 1.2 Various Dividend Discount Models  

# Contents  

Three Important Formulae: What can we do for equities? PV future dividends, which are CFs paid out to shareholders Three important formulae: 1. Constant Dividend (annuity – no growth) 2. Constant Growth 3. Fast Growth, then Constant Growth  
# Dividend Discount Model: No Growth, Annuity Formulae  

Assume dividends constant, perpetual annuity  

• CF = D  

Constant dividend (no growth)  
$$
P V={\frac{D}{1+y}}+{\frac{D}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot={\frac{D}{y}}={\frac{D}{r f+r p}}
$$  

• Not realistic for most equities, but useful start  

 !500  

Based on summation formula (you should know):  
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=x\cdot{\frac{1}{1-\beta}}\quad a n d\quad\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=x\cdot{\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}}
$$  

When    $\begin{array}{r}{\beta=\frac{1}{1+y}}\end{array}$    and    $x{=}D$  , then  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=D\cdot{\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}}=D\cdot{\frac{1}{1+y}}\cdot{\frac{1+y}{1+y-1}}={\frac{D}{y}}
$$  

# Dividend Discount Model: Constant Growth  

Say a company expected to grow at constant rate forever Constant growth    $g$   per year  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{D_{1}=D_{0}\left(1+g\right)}}\\ {{D_{2}=D_{0}\left(1+g\right)^{2}}}\end{array}
$$  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{P V={\frac{D_{0}(1+g)}{1+y}}+{\frac{D_{0}(1+g)^{2}}{(1+y)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot={\frac{D_{0}(1+g)}{y-g}}}\\ {={\frac{D_{1}}{y-g}}={\frac{D_{1}}{r f+r p-g}}}\end{array}
$$  

 !500  

Much more useful than “no growth” Both these formulae come from summation formula:  
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=x\cdot{\frac{1}{1-\beta}}\quad a n d\quad\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=x\cdot{\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}}
$$  

When    $\begin{array}{r}{\beta=\frac{1}{1+y}}\end{array}$    and    $x{=}D$  , then  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=D\cdot{\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}}=D\cdot{\frac{1}{1+y}}\cdot{\frac{1+y}{1+y-1}}={\frac{D}{y}}
$$  

and when    $\textstyle\beta={\frac{1+g}{1+y}}$    and    ${x}{=}{D}_{0}$  , then  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x\cdot\beta^{i}=D_{0}\cdot{\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}}=D_{0}\cdot{\frac{1+g}{1+y}}\cdot{\frac{1}{1-{\frac{1+g}{1+y}}}}=D_{0}\cdot{\frac{1+g}{1+y}}\cdot{\frac{1}{{\frac{1+y-1-g}{1+y}}}}={\frac{D_{0}\cdot(1+g)}{y-g}}={\frac{D_{1}\cdot(1+g)}{y-g}}
$$  $$
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}x\cdot\beta^{i}=D_{0}\cdot{\frac{\beta\left(1-\beta^{n}\right)}{1-\beta}}=D_{0}\cdot{\frac{1+g}{1+y}}\cdot{\frac{1}{1-{\frac{1+g}{1+y}}}}\left[1-\left({\frac{1+g}{1+y}}\right)^{n}\right]={\frac{D_{1}}{y-g}}\left[1-\left({\frac{1+g}{1+y}}\right)^{n}\right]
$$  

# Dividend Discount Model: Fast then Constant Growth  

Many companies expected to grow fast, then slow  

• So have fast growth – say for 5 yrs – then slower growth    $g$  

Use “Multistage Growth Model”  

[^1]: Calculate PV of “1st stage” dividends (say in spread-sheet)
$$
P V_{1s t}=\frac{D1}{1+y}+\frac{D2}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{D5}{\left(1+y\right)^{5}}
$$  

[^2]: Constant growth    $g$   per year starting yr 5:
$$
P V_{2n d}=\frac{P V_{c g}}{\left(1+y\right)^{5}}=\frac{{P5(1+g)\mathord{\left/{\vphantom{5(1+g)y}}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace}y-g}}{\left(1+y\right)^{5}}
$$  

[^3]: Combine these:    $P V_{T o t a l}=P V_{1s t}+P V_{2n d}$

# Using Our Two Fundamental Ideas  

Only Two Fundamental Ideas: Discounting   $\&$   Risk Adjustment  

• Same ideas and same tools as for bonds • Spend so much time with bonds, so we learn about PV (discounting) and risk adjustment  

General idea:  

• Discount CFs  

Find income statement, balance sheet, cash ﬂow statement at https://www.market watch.com/investing/stock/ibm/ﬁn ﬂow  
Challenges Using DDM Ideas are simple, but huge practical problems: 1. Guessing at dividends – IBM example • Paid cash dividends of about \$5.77/share (\$5,380mn) in 2019 • Also share buyback of about \$4.65/share (\$4,340mn) • Turns out Cash Dividends    $\leftrightarrow$  Share Buyback – Completely changes the numbers 2. Guessing at growth (for dividends) 3. Guessing at discount rate • Central focus of next 2 weeks • Risk and Portfolio Theory; CAPM Many other issues discussed in textbook  

# 1.3 What are Dividends? Firm Payout  

# Contents  

# Equity – Residual Cash Claimant  

• Pay employees, taxes, debt, etc., Left over is “residual cash ﬂow”  

Let’s look at FIS, take apart the income, expenses Revenue comes in, expenses (wages, taxes, ...) go out What’s left over either:  

• Pay out to shareholders (common stock, equity holders) • Retain earnings – invest in running and growing the business (more future proﬁts)  

 !500  

Find income statement, balance sheet, cash ﬂow statement at https://www.market watch.com/investing/stock/ﬁs/ﬁnan Some details:  

• Retained earnings can be found from the balance sheet: change in retained earnings 2017-2018  

• Dividends (on accrual basis) are calculated as net income less retained earnings  

The Cash Flow statement also shows repurchase of Common Stock (-1.26B). This is, as discussed below, also a payout to shareholders and equivalent to a dividend payment.  
# Dividends – Regular Quarterly Payments  

FIS paid about   $50\%$   of earnings (net income) to dividends  

• Managers (and investors) think that FIS has good  internal  investments • Should pay to investors unless internal investments better than “market”  

Some businesses pay little, re-invest most. Others pay out most, re-invest little  

IBM: pay out 65% Consolidated Edison: pay out   $65\%$  Microsoft: pay out   $40\%$   (was   $0\%$  ) AT&T: pay out   $27\%$  Google: pay out   $0\%$  

Payout ratios: Yahoo Finance, “Statistics”  

• Go to Yahoo Finance, search for “IBM” or “Google”

 • Look for “Statistics” for dividend and payout information

 • But do not use “Financials” “Cash Flow” - use https://www.market watch.com/investing/stocks –  Go to “Search” then search for “IBM” then “Financials”

• Discount   $\mathrm{Rate=y=rf+rp=2.5+6.71=9.21\%}$  • Growth   $25\%$   for ﬁrst 5 years, then growth   $6.643\%$   after  

For “Multistage Growth Model” the steps are:  
[^1]: Calculate PV of “1st stage” dividends (say in spread-sheet) – in this case 5 years
$$
P V_{1s t}=\frac{D1}{1+y}+\frac{D2}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{D5}{\left(1+y\right)^{5}}
$$  

• Calculate dividends by   $\mathrm{D1}=\mathrm{D0^{*}}(1.25)=1.3^{*}1.25$  ;  $\mathrm{D2}=\mathrm{D0^{*}}(1.25)\,{\hat{\ }}\,2=1.3^{*}1.5625;$  ... • Then discount dividends by (1.0921),   $\left(1.0921\right)\mathbf{\hat{\Sigma}}2$  , ... •   $\mathrm{PV1st}=\S9.925$  

[^2]: Constant growth    $g$   per year starting yr 5:
$$
P V_{2n d}=\frac{P V_{c g}}{(1+y)^{5}}=\frac{\frac{D5(1+g)\big/y-g}{(1+y)^{5}}}{(1+y)^{5}}
$$  

•   $\mathrm{D5}=\S3.967$  
$\mathrm{PVcg=D5(1+g)/(y-g)=3.967^{*}(1.06643)/(.0921-.06643)=164.82}$   $\mathrm{PV2nd}=\mathrm{PVc g}\;/\;\left(\mathrm{1+y}\right)\,\widehat{\ }\,5=164.82\;/\;\left(1.0921\;\widehat{\ }\,5\right)=106.10\$  

[^3]: Combine these:    $P V_{T o t a l}=P V_{1s t}+P V_{2n d}$

•  $\mathrm{PVtotal}=9.925\,+\,106.10=116.025$  • Basically, the   $\S116$   price that we see in the market

# Process for Cash Dividend  

 !500  

Process for cash dividend  
Firm announces quarterly dividend on the declaration date. Generally dividends don’t change from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year so pretty much non-event (unless there’s a change)  

Also announce record date – date at which you have to be registered in the books and records as owning the share to get the dividend. Two days prior to this the shares start trading without the dividend and the share drops by the dividend amount. (Everyone knows this so really just a convention – before that x-d date you get the dividend so share is worth X+dividend. After x-d date you don’t get dividend so share is worth X.)  

Checks mailed some weeks later.

Dividend & Buyback Equivalent Equity (common stock) gets “what’s left over” • Pay employees, taxes, debt, etc., Left over is “residual cash ﬂow” Actually two ways to pay out shareholders 1. Cash Dividend (above) 2. Buyback (buy shares in the market) Both give cash back to shareholders • Equivalent • But huge confusion and controversy News stories about “evils” of stock buybacks  

# Dividend & Buyback Equivalent

Prior to 1983 no share repurchase s.  

• A ﬁrm wanting to manipulate share price could secretly buy shares.  

• Nothing wrong openly buying shares – transfer cash to shareholders  

[^1980]: s, rule change, SEC’s ruly 10b-18

Prior to 1983 there were no share repurchase s. Part of the change was rule changes. A ﬁrm that wants to manipulate its share price (keep it art i ci ally high) could secretly buy shares. This has been known to be done, and was a popular game during the 1920s. There is nothing nefarious about a ﬁrm openly buying shares as a way of transferring cash to shareholders, but prior to the SEC’s ruly 10b-18 ﬁrms trying to simply transfer cash could have been accused of trying to manipulate  
Information – Dividends and Share Repurchase s Dividends can provide information that a ﬁrm is proﬁtable and management is conﬁdent • Easy to make announcements, possible to massage earnings reports • Harder to pay out cash on a regular basis without cash • Thus, regular cash dividends signal that a ﬁrm is proﬁtable • In the US at least, dividends are taken as a valuable piece of information • Problem: how do ﬁrms return cash from temporary surge of pro t ability? Share repurchase s tend to be temporary • In the US at least the implicit arrangement is that share repurchase s are often temporary or one-o!  

# Information and Dividends and Share Repurchase s  

Dividends can provide information that a ﬁrm is proﬁtable and management is conﬁdent  

• It is easy to make positive announcements, possible to massage earnings reports even for a long time, and ﬁrms have even been known to fraudulently alter earnings.  

• But it is much harder to pay out cash on a regular basis unless you actually have cash. • Thus, regular cash dividends are a concrete sign that a ﬁrm is actually proﬁtable.  

• In the US at least, dividends are taken as a valuable piece of information about a ﬁrm’s current and expected future pro t ability. Note, however, that part of this is dependent on an implicit agreement between managers and investors that managers will not change very often and very much – managers will change dividends when they are conﬁdent they will be able to maintain those dividends for a long time. We could think of an environment where managers increases dividends temporarily when they have a temporary cash increase and so changes in dividends don’t provide too much information about management s’ views of future prospects. Some other countries have somewhat di!erent implicit arrangements.  

• Such an implicit arrangement – where dividends are used as a reliable signal of current and future pro t ability – leaves the problem of how do ﬁrms return cash to investors when there is a temporary surge of pro t ability and the ﬁrm does not have projects to invest.  

Share repurchase s tend to be temporary  

• In the US at least the implicit arrangement is that share repurchase s are often temporary or one-o!.

Rational Demi conductor [Brealey et al.(2013)Brealey, Myers, and Allen] is chapter 16  

• The idea here is that the ﬁrm has retained \$1,000 for a new project. • But the project turns out to be worthless, so the ﬁrm decides not to invest the   $\S1{,}000$   and instead return to investors  

• Two choices –  Cash dividend, give each shareholder   $\S1$   in a cash dividend –  Share buyback, buy 100 shares at   $\S10$   each  

• The share price will be di!erent in the two cases, but so will the number of shares. The value at the end will be the same in both cases.

Se curit iz ation – Pooling Assets & Cash Flows Pooling of assets and repackaging of the underlying cashﬂows Examples  

 !500  

• Mutual Funds, hedge funds, Exchange Traded Funds  

• Mortgage-backed and asset-back securities  

• Common Stocks  

• “Equity” (mutual fund) vs “bond” pools (MBS, “Se curit iz ation”)  

Legal Structure  

• “Fund” and “Manager” separate legal entities • Mutual Funds in US – Investment Co & Advisors Acts, 1940 • Hedge Funds – often o!-shore (eg Caymans) – tax & regulatory • Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities (bonds)  

Reasons for Pooling  

• Spreads & Diversiﬁes risk (mortgage-backed bonds) • Lowers cost (mutual funds); professional management (hedge funds) • Investors: Access to assets unavailable otherwise • Sponsors/Owners: Move assets o! balance sheet (borrow)  

Se curit iz ation  

• Pooling of assets and repackaging of the underlying cashﬂows  

• Often into bonds  

• Sometimes “trancheing” to create di!erent payment or credit characteristics from those of the underlying assets  

Se curit iz ation Assets:  

• Assets that go into the pool • Often ﬁxed income instruments such as mortgages or loans or corporate bonds or credit card receivable s  
Se curit iz ation Liabilities:  

• Often bonds but also mutual funds, common stocks  

• Sometimes structured in tranches ordered in terms of payment priority  

# Examples  

• Mutual Funds  

• Hedge Funds  

• Mortgage-backed securities.md)  

–  Pass-through (Agency – Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac – pass-throughs). Simply pool together a group of mortgages and pass through the income – payment of income and principal. –  Tanched. Pool together a group of mortgages but sell di!erent  

• Other Asset-Backed securities – student loans, credit card receivable s, even David Bowie’s bond (1997 – revenues from 25 albums recorded before 1990)  

• Common Stocks  

–  Not usually talked about as a se curit iz ation or pooled assets, but in many ways that is exactly what a share in a publicly-listed company is – a share in the cash ﬂows generated by the pooled activities from the company. –  Usually we talk about se curit iz ation of passive assets (things like other bonds or mortgages) and not active assets like for an on-going business. –  This ties back nicely to the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co, although the South Sea Co was truly a pooling of passive assets – simply government annuities  

• Distinction between “equity”-type pools and “bond”-type pools  

–  Equity-type: mutual funds, hedge funds, ETFs. For these the investors get a proportionate share of whatever proﬁts –  Bond-type: Senior tranches for tranched securities: promised CFs. Here investors are promised a CF. The pooling is valuable usually because it improves divers i cation and makes the “promise” more reliable, more certain to be paid.  

# Legal Structure  

• “Fund” and “Manager” separate legal entities  

–  Manager may be Corporation –  Fund often a Trust or a Partnership or itself a Corporation –  The Fund hires the the manager and pays a fee plus various expenses –  The Fund will often have a Board of Directors who represent the interests of the shareholders (owners of the Fund and thus bene cia ries of the fund’s assets) –  Assets are held in custody for the fund. Custodian is hired by the Fund, legally responsible to the fund and the Board  

• Mutual Funds in US –  Investment Company (fund) which holds assets and sells shares in itself – proportionate share of cash ﬂows  
–  Investment Manager (manager) who manages the assets of the Investment Company. But a legally separate entity that cannot take the assets from the Investment Company –  Investment Co Act 1940 – sets rules and regulations for Investment Co structure and operations –  Investment Advisors Act 1940 – rules and regulations for managers  

• Hedge Funds –  Often the “Fund” is o!-shore – say Carmen islands – for tax and regulator reasons.  

• Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities (bonds)  

–  Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) – separate legal entity that holds the assets, sells securities that are usually more bond-like than equity-like –  Investors are lending money to the SPV with the promise to get paid back – that promise may be a good or a poor promise.  

# Reasons for se curit iz ation  

• Spreads & Diversiﬁes risk  

–  Big reason for mortgage-backed bonds. If you invest   $\S100\mathrm{k}$   in one mortgage then if the homeowner defaults you are out. There may be only a 5% chance but on that you lose everything. But if you invest   $\S100\mathrm{k}$   in a mortgage-backed bond with 1,000 mortgages then there’s a pretty good chance that 5% will default but then you only lose 5%, and in any case you can price that in up-front because it becomes pretty certain how much you will lose (  $5\%$   of your investment) rather than all or nothing.  

• Lowers cost of access (mutual funds) or provides professional management expertise (hedge funds)  

–  One of the biggest reasons for mutual funds and ETFs

 • Helps monitor and discipline (maybe 1720, South Sea & Mississippi)  

–  This may have been a reasons for the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co. Although they did it very poorly – in fact the South Sea managers were really fraudsters. –  But the Bank of England that managed the government debt, while not really pooling the government assets, played this role. –  Not something we think is necessary today for government debt, at least not in developed countries. But in 1720 could have been very valuable.  

• Widens audience and market  

–  For investors can provide access to markets not available otherwise. ∗E.g. for credit-card receivable s, investors would have a hard time investing (buying) except through se curit iz ation. ∗David Bowie’s records is another example – investors could not get invest if not se curit i zed –  For Sponsors / Owners or assets, can be a way to “move assets o! balance-sheet”  $^*$  What this really means is that it is a way to raise money, to borrow – collateralized. ∗e.g. mortgages. A bank makes mortgages, using its money to lend to homeowners. ∗It then pools those mortgages together, puts into an SPV, and sells bonds against those mortgages.  $^*$  The investors are lending to the bank, with the mortgages as collateral.  
# Pass-Through vs Trancheing (Waterfall)  

 !500  

Outline  

• Pass-through: all investors get same CFs  

–  Tranched: sell senior & junior (equity) tranches –  Pre-speciﬁed rules (“waterfall”) for how cash is distributed  

Simple Trancheing Example  

• “Senior”: gets 20% of CFs, ﬁrst priority  

• “Equity”: 80% of CFs, but lowest priority  

• Equity loses money ﬁrst  

Probability (54%) of   $\S10$   loss – pay back either   $\S100$   or   $\S90$  

• Senior is ﬁrst priority, always gets   $\mathsection$  20 (  $100\%$  ) back • Equity su!ers the loss, gets either   $\S80$   (  $100\%$  ) or \$70 (87.5%) • Senior riskless, Equity more risky (lose more than   $10\%$   of original)  

Pricing (5yr,   $\S5$   coup,   $5\%$   risky,   $4\%$   risk-free yield)  

• Underlying  must be  \$100 (  $\mathrm{PV}(\S5\ @\ 5\%)$  ) • Senior now risk-free,  must be    $\S104.45$   (PV(\$5 @ 4%) – pay   $\S20.89$   for   $20\%$  

• Equity  implied    $\S98.89$   (  $\mathrm{100{=}}.\mathrm{2^{*}104.45{+}.8^{*}98.89)}$  ) – pay   $\S79.11$   for 80%  

 !500  

# Pass-through versus trancheing  

This detail (for example on trancheing) is not necessary for History of Financial Crises – for Applied Financial Management  

• Pass-through: all investors get same cash-ﬂows - proportional to their ownership (investment) • Tranched: the cash-ﬂows are “tranched” according to some set of rules –  Assets pooled, but then cash ﬂows are “tranched” according to some rule, and di!erent classes of securities (shares in the pool) sold.  
• Example:  

–    $\S100$   of mortgages. –  Mortgage is 5yrs, 5% coupon, pays back   $\S100$   in 5 years. Price \$100,   $\mathrm{yId}=5\%$  
$^*$  Current risk-free rate is 4%. 100bp spread (risky 5%, risk-free 4%)  

–  But this mortgage is risky. 54% chance that   $10\%$   of the mortgages will default on the ﬁnal principal repayment  

∗54% chance that all coupons will be paid but that   $10\%$   of the mortgages will not repay the ﬁnal   $\S100$   $^*$  in other words 54% chance you get \$90 instead of   $\S100$   at the end  

–  Trancheing can change the risk proﬁle. Here will will tranche into senior (with no risk) and equity (with the remaining or residual or increased risk)  

–  Make 2 tranches: Split   $100\%$   (100 shares) into top 20% and bottom 80%  
$^*$  Top tranche is called the “senior” tranche –   $20\%$   of this pool is “senior”  $^*$  Bottom tranche is called “equity” tranche –   $80\%$   of this pool is “equity”  $^*$  Senior tranche (top   $20\%$  ) gets ﬁrst priority for cash ﬂows – either coupon or principal. Every   $\S1$   that is supposed to come in, these shares get the ﬁrst   $20\Phi$   $^*$  Equity tranche (bottom   $80\%$  ) gets whatever is left. Every   $\S1$   that is supposed to come in, these shares get whatever is left after paying the 20¢ to the top tranche  $^*$  Example:   $\S100$   is promised. \$90 comes in. Senior tranche gets   $\S20$   (20% of the   $\S100$  promised). Equity tranche gets   $\S70$   (what is left). Since the equity tranche was promised   $\S80$  , this   $\S70$   is only   $87.5\%$   of what they were promised. ∗Result: Overall loss was   $10\%$   (promised   $\S100$  , paid   $\S90$  ). Senior tranche loss was   $0\%$  (promised \$20, paid   $\S20$  ). Equity tranche loss was   $12.5\%$   (promised \$80, paid   $\S70$  ).  Senior tranche has reduced risk, equity tranche increased risk  

• Example of cash ﬂow tranche or cash-ﬂow cascade or waterfall (with 20% senior, 80% equity)  

Promised   $\mathrm{CF}=\S100$  , Actual   $\mathrm{CF}=\S100$  
 !500  
How do we price this? Actually very easy in this case.  

• We know the price of the risky mortgages (  $\S100$  , 5% yield) and the risk-free rate (  $4\%$  , for risk-free cash ﬂows)  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{~-~PV}(\mathrm{rky~mortgages})=\S100}&{}\\ {\mathrm{~-~PV}(5\%~\mathrm{coopen}\ @\ 4\%\ \mathrm{yield})=104.4518}\end{array}
$$  

• The senior tranche is now risk-free so this must be priced at   $\mathbb{S}104.4518$  . We are selling   $20\%$   of the shares at this price, so this is   $\S20.8904$   (  $\mathbb{S}104.4518^{*}0.20)$  . The balance we have to sell at  $\S79.1096$   (to make the total   $\S100$  )  

 !500  
Details for pricing of “mortgage bond”  

• 5-year, 5% annual coupon,   $\S{100}$   bullet re-payment (not amortizing like a true mortgage).  

• Chance that   $10\%$   of mortgages will fail to repay principal  

• Price \$100, so yield (risky yield) 5%  

• Risk-free rate   $4\%$  , so risk-free bond PV(5yr bond, 5% coupon,  $4\%{\mathrm{~yield}})=\S104.4518$  

• Assume that all coupons paid with certainty,   $10\%$   of principal will default with some probability (either no-default and get   $\S100$  , or yes-default at year 5 and get \$90)  

• Use risk-neutral (risk-adjusted) pricing:  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{P V(r i s k y\,5\%\,c o u o n\,@\,4\%\,r i s k-f r e e)}}\\ {{=P V(\S5\,a n n u i t y\,@4\%)+(1-\phi)\cdot P V(\S100\,@\,4\%)+\phi\cdot P V(\S90\,@\,4\%)}}\end{array}
$$  

Implies (risk-neutral) probability of default is    $\phi=54.16\%$  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\qquad\qquad P V(t r a n c h e d\,5\%\,c o u o n\,@\,4\%\,r i s k-f r e e)}\\ &{=P V(\S5\,a n n u i t y\,@4\%)+(1-\phi)\cdot P V(\S100\,@\,4\%)+\phi\cdot P V(\S87.5\,@\,4\%)}\end{array}
$$

# WHAT IS A FIRM?  

# 1. This seems like a silly question – everyone knows what a ﬁrm is.  

(a) But when you start asking the question a little more carefully, it is not as simple as it seems. A ﬁrm can be anything from a single-member LLC (owned and operated by a single person) to a huge ﬁrm such as GM with thousands of employees and o"ces around the world.  

(b) General outline of legal organization of ﬁrms in the US (see, eg, state of CT form REG-1 for registering a new business) (Note that legal organization of a ﬁrm is generally under state law, so that the legal structure can vary from state-to-state, although for most major legal forms they are pretty standard across states.)  

i. Sole Proprietorship – single individual simply running a business – an example might be a tailor running out of their home or a shop – and having all proﬁts going to their income and ﬁling taxes under their own name without any further legal structure. ii. Partnership – arrangement by two or more individuals with each having liability for all debts, and proﬁts going to the partners and being split by whatever arrangement the partners agree – proﬁts go to the individual’s income and taxed under their own name. Ownership of partnership cannot be separated from partners, and partnership does not have legal existence outside of partners (ceases when a partner dies). Ownership not freely transfer r able. A. Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) – as a partnership but introduces limited liability – proﬁts distributed to partners and taxed with their individual income – entity does not have legal existence outside of partners  

iii. Limited Liability Company (LLC) – a group of people that get together and own the company with proﬁts split by whatever owners agree – very much like a partnership, with proﬁts usually going to individuals and being taxed as part of their personal income, but does have legal existence separate from the owners (called “managers” at least in CT) and ownership can be transferred, but usually not freely.  

A. One major di!erence between partnership and LLC is limited liability nature of LLC. Basically, LLC was invented as a way of allowing individuals to ﬂexibly get together, own and manage a business, without having their personal assets at risk in the company. If a partnership goes into bankruptcy, the debtors may be able to go after the personal assets (cars, bank accounts) of the partners. (But there are Limited and General partnerships.) B. This is a relatively new (say past 10-20 years) structure that is now recognized throughout the US. C. Part way between Partnership and Corporation  

iv. Corporation – what we usually think of as a “ﬁrm” such as GM – owned by a few or many individuals, with free transfer ability of ownership, and with a legal existence separate from the individual managers or those who own its shares at a particular point in time. A legal entity under the law, can enter into agreements under its own name.  
A. Concept of limited liability – very important because it means that an owner is not liable for more than they put into the company. If you buy a share of GM you can lose all you paid for that share, but nobody can come after you to collect more. B. Free transfer ability of shares  

(c) A little history of the corporation  

i. Joint-stock companies in England during 16th and 17th centuries, created to explore and trade overseas. Decision-making in hands of directors, shares freely transferable. Companies had to secure a royal charter because people were not free to travel or trade overseas. ii. By later 17th century businessmen ﬁgured out they could copy the structure of the royally-chartered companies but make them fully private. iii. Bubble Act of 1720 – the South Sea Company, a chartered corporation, convinced Parliament to ban non-chartered companies. Basically, the South Sea Company was trying to put competitors out of business (although at the time there were myriad “bubble companies” that were purely speculative or fraudulent ventures). From the South Sea Company and the Bubble Act we get the term “bubble” to refer to any speculative excess (as in “housing bubble”). iv. In response businessmen and barristers ﬁgured out how to combine partnerships and trusts to mimic corporate structure – managerial power concentrated in a few hands and freely transferable partnership interests for others. v. Eventually Parliament relented – Companies Act of 1844. vi. In Colonies, Bubble Act was extended to colonies in 1741 but American promoters were able to create corporate features without incorporating. But some companies still incorporated, getting charters from the state legislature, because the charter granted monopoly or other rights. vii. Reformers denounced special charters, and new era started in 1837 when Connecticut became ﬁrst state to enact all-purpose, general incorporation statute – standardized, simpliﬁed process for creating a corporation. A. Basically, CT said organizer no longer had to obtain special charter, just had to ﬁle certain factual information. No governmental permission required to create a corporation, it is created by private contract with the state serving as a registry. B. That is the situation we are currently in – states register an incorporation and generally required not i cation if you do business in the state (if for nothing else, for the collection of state taxes) but they do not grant permission.  

[^2]: Also, the question of what actually constitutes a speciﬁc ﬁrm is not trivial – outsourcing and the boundaries of the ﬁrm – consider a PC ﬁrm that outsources production to Taiwan, help-center services to call centers in India, accounting services to an accounting ﬁrm, and o"ce cleaning services to a local service company. Does the computer “ﬁrm” include the manufacturing and help-center, or are those market purchased goods and services. Many subtle questions here.

[^3]: For now we will not go there, but pretend we know exactly what a “ﬁrm” is – a legal entity, created and owned by individuals, that produces and sells goods or services and which acts to maximize proﬁts.

(a) This excludes entities such as the UK’s National Health Service run by the government or a local charity. But it includes a huge, and hugely important, section of what is done in our society.  

(b) Critical – assumption of proﬁt maximization – from this all things ﬂow.

# Common Stock or Equity  

Common stock, shares, equity, are all names for the ownership. Three important characteristics –  

[^1]: limited liability,

• cannot lose more than you put in. Can always just walk away. This is simple to say but has very important implications. We’ll see in talking about ﬁnancial distress and agency issues that the limited liability of shareholders can lead to some very interesting games being played between shareholders and debt holders.  

[^2]: residual cash ﬂow,

• get to keep whatever is left over after workers, suppliers, debt holders, etc. are all paid. In other words, get the company proﬁts. A publicly-traded share is just a proportionate share in the proﬁts. If there are 100 shares out there, each share gets 1/100 of the proﬁts. If 1mn shares, each share gets 1/1mn of the proﬁts.  

[^3]: control or ownership

• more complicated issue than residual CF. Technically shareholders own and control the company, but as a practical issue for most publicly traded companies there are so many shareholders, with ownership so widely distributed, that control is delegated to a board of directors and the managers. We’ll have much more to say about this later.  
 !500  

Let’s look at Honeywell international and discuss some of the institutional characteristics of equity. Start with book value of common stockholder’s equity (table 14.2 in BMA).  

 !500  
Actually, to my mind, most of this is pretty useless to anyone but lawyers and accountants  

• Number of shares – From legal perspective, this provides some information. Articles of incorporation or bylaws state how many shares may be issued. Mainly a legal and documentation issue – authorized shares usually set at some high number so don’t have to go back and get a new board resolution or shareholders meeting just to issue new shares. For Honeywell, 2bn shares authorized, but only 958mn have been issued.  

• Outstanding vs. Treasury Shares – Treasury shares are shares that have been issued but later bought back by the company. We’ll talk about share repurchase s shortly and we’ll see that this share repurchase s is a very common way of returning money to stockholders nowadays. For Honeywell there are are 735mn shares outstanding. This is the only worthwhile number from here – we need to know the number of shares to calculate the market value (MV of Equity =  $\#$   shares outstanding \* price per share)  

• The value information at the top is pretty meaningless.  

–  The value of “Common Shares” (\$958mn) is meaningless for two reasons. First, it is value at par of \$1/share – par value is nothing but a legal ﬁction – for historical legal reasons shares usually have to be given some value in the articles of incorporation, and values such as   $\S1$   or 1 cent are commonly chosen. Second, it includes all shares issued, including Treasury shares that have been repurchased.  
–  “Additional paid-in capital” is the additional capital (above the par value   $\mathsection$  958mn) raised from selling shares. This might mean something except that it’s book value – value at time shares were issued and not current market value –  Retained earnings – the additional equity raised by retaining proﬁts and not paying them out to shareholders. –  Treasury shares – this is the amount the ﬁrm paid out to repurchase the Treasury shares. –  Note that the equity created by net proﬁts retained (the net of retained earnings less Treasury shares) is, for Honeywell, almost half the equity created by newly issued equity. i.e. retained earnings is a very important way of creating new equity.  

• The ﬁnal value, “Net common equity” of  $^\S7,187$  , is pretty meaningless. It is the sum of historical values and may have little relation to market values.  

• The original equity (par value plus additional paid-in capital) could have been issued 50 years ago. If Honeywell invested in good projects and the ﬁrm grew, that original equity would have grown substantially.  

• In fact, the   $\S$  7,187mn implies, for   $735\mathrm{{mm}}$   shares, a value of   $\S9.78$  /share. In December 2008 the actual value was more like   $\S35$  .  

To repeat, about the only valuable information from that table is the 735mn outstanding shares.

# Ownership and Voting  

Equity ownership implies company ownership  

• In practice, ownership so widely distributed equity holders do not make management decisions • Control is delegated to professional managers  

• Di!erent for small companies  

For large public corporations, common stockholders’ right of control limited to voting for appointments to the board of directors  

• The board acts as the stockholders’ representatives • Managers are, in theory, responsible to stockholders through the board  

Voting  

• Many stockholders don’t vote  

• Some investors specialize in buying shares and pressuring companies to make changes. Called activist shareholders.  

• Majority vs. Cumulative Voting  

Ownership and Voting – equity ownership implies company ownership  

• Generally owning the equity of the ﬁrm means owning the ﬁrm itself – the right to residual proﬁts and the right to control.  

• In practice, for public companies in developed countries share ownership is so widely distributed that equity holders do not make direct management decisions.  

• By-and-large, control is delegated to professional managers  

–  Note that this will not be true for small companies. A small company will usually have the owners also be the managers. For example, the hedge fund I started and ran for a number of years was owned by three of us (we held the shares, until we sold a percentage to an outside fund) and running and managing the ﬁrm was also our full time jobs.  

• In practice, for large public corporations, common stockholders’ right of control is limited to the right to vote for appointments to the board of directors and some crucial matters (such as mergers, changes in articles of incorporation or bylaws).  

–  The board acts as the stockholders’ representatives and managers are, in theory, responsible to stockholders through the board.  

• We will talk more about the board and corporate governance later.  

• Voting  

–  Many stockholders don’t vote – feel they own so few shares it doesn’t matter –  Some investors specialize in buying shares (often concentrating on single companies and buying large blocks) and pressuring companies to make changes – in other words actively exercising their ownership rights. Called activist shareholders. –  Majority vs. Cumulative Voting –  Majority – each director voted separately, and one vote per share per director –  Cumulative – still get one vote per share per director but can cumulate votes and apply all to a single director. This makes it easier for activist investors to have an impact, and thus some shareholder groups campaign for cumulative voting.  
# Dual-class shares and minority rights  

Residual cash ﬂow and control rights might not go together.  

• Two classes of shares, identical in CF rights but di!erent voting rights. • More common in Europe than in the US, but it does happen – Google  

Minority rights – a touchy problem.  

• Majority shareholders may try to deprive minority shareholders of cash or rights.  

• Example: Russian company  

Dual-class shares and minority rights  

It is not necessary that residual cash ﬂow and control rights go together. Sometimes there are two classes of shares, identical in their rights to cash ﬂows but with di!erent voting rights. This tends to be more common in Europe than in the US, but it does happen – the book cites Google, whose owners created two share classes to enable them to retain control over the company when they ﬁrst issued shares to the public.  

Minority rights – a touchy problem. Problem that majority shareholders may exercise their majority ownership rights to deprive minority shareholders of cash or rights.  

Book cites example of a Russian company where the majority defrauded minority shareholders – majority shareholder created 1 share out of every 136,000 existing shares. Minority shareholders had fewer than 136,000, so they got paid o! at par – as we saw above this is often far below market value.  

These kind of games are generally not allowed in developed countries – but then Russia is a wild place to do business. The government closed Yukos (former large oil company). The story of Yukos and Kh odor kov sky is pretty amazing. The Russian tax authorities claimed they owed \$28bn in taxes – a pretty ridiculous number given revenue and taxes paid by other oil companies. Seems politically-motivated – government expropriation of assets. Assets were bought at auction for   $\S9.4$  bn in December 2004 (about half of what they’d been estimated a few months earlier). The company that bought (Baikal nan sgr up) was incorporated only a few days earlier and at an address occupied by a snack bar, and there were no competing bids. Baikal nan s group was acquired shortly afterward by Rosneft, the state-owned oil company. In all, very shady dealings.  

# Preferred Equity  

Not large for most companies, but important idea Tiering or cascade of cash ﬂows: • First to debt-holders. These payments are required, not paying means default • Second to preferred stockholders • Only third to common shareholders  

Preferred Equity  

• Not large for most companies, but important idea  

• Still equity, in that no promise of payment, but actually somewhat intermediate between debt and common equity.  

–  Like debt, amount of payments set up-front, but like equity company can choose not to pay a preferred dividend still not be in default – preferred dividend not a ﬁxed promise –  But most preferred issues are cumulative preferred stock which requires any past missed preferred dividends be made up before any common dividends can be paid. –  Thus we have a tiering or cascade of cash ﬂows:  $^*$  First to debt-holders. These payments are required, not paying means default  $^*$  Second to preferred stockholders.  $^*$  Only third to common shareholders.  

–  This cash ﬂow cascading is taken much further in structured products such as CDOs and CMOs. These take existing securities and slice up the cash ﬂows in various ways to change the risk / return characteristics of resulting new securities.  

–  For various reasons company proﬁts are not sliced up so ﬁnely among various securities, but the cascading and slicing between debt, preferred, and common shows some of this.  

∗Why don’t company cash ﬂows get sliced up so ﬁnely? I think main reason has to do with asymmetric information and contracts. For CDOs and CMOs the amount of cash generated by the securities behind the CDO or CMO can be observed and veriﬁed easily by everyone, both buyers and sellers. The cash just has to be sliced up according to the pre-set rules. For a corporation, however, there can be substantial uncertainty about the actual proﬁts in any quarter or year. There could be incentives for the owners to lie about the level of CF. Thus just very simple structures, with debt getting promised payment, then whatever is left over going to equity (common and preferred). Easy to monitor if interest is paid on the debt, and severe penalties (default and bankruptcy) if not.

# Calculating Risk Premium Seems Complicated  

 !500  

• Use expected utility to get the CE (single, certainty equivalent CF)  
$$
u(C E)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  

• Adjust the original CFs until the average (or promised) CF from the distribution equals the CE  
$$
C E=p\cdot C F_{a d j}^{l o}+(1-p)\cdot C F_{a d j}^{h i}
$$  

• Write the adjustment as a ratio 1/(1+rp)  $\begin{array}{r}{{1}/({1}{+}{\mathrm{rp}})\;C E=\frac{1}{1+r p}\left[p\cdot C F_{o r i g}^{l o}+(1-p)\cdot C F_{o r i g}^{h i}\right]=\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{1+r p}}\end{array}$  ! "  

• Apply the adjustment and discounting together to end at risk-adjusted discounting  
$$
P V={\frac{C E}{1+y_{u s t}}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{\left(1+y_{u s t}\right)\left(1+r p\right)}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{\left(1+y_{r i s k y}\right)}}
$$  

How do we ever do this in practice?

Bond Market & FIS Example – Risk-Adjusted Yield  

Market gives us risk premium – embedded in price (settle 31-dec-15)  

• UST:   $2.25\%$   coupon, 15-nov-25 P=99.84375, Y=2.268%sab  $-\ 1.02268=(1+u s t)$  

• FIS:   $5\%$   coupon, 15-oct-25 P=103.626, Y=4.536%sab  $-\ 1.04536=(1+u s t)\cdot(1+r p)\Rightarrow1+r p=1.02218$   or    $r p=2.218\%$  

The UST CFs are known, the FIS only  promised  CFs, but CF diagram useful We can just calculate yield, market gives us risk premium!  

 !500  

Generally use spread:   $\mathrm{rp}=4.54\%-2.27\%=227\mathrm{bp}$  

# Bond Spreads Measure Uncertainty & Credit Risk  

Spread between UST ( risk-free ) and corporate  risk-adjusted  yields  

• 31-jan-16: UST   $2.27\%$  , FIS   $4.54\%=>$   spread = 227bp • Market’s assessment of credit risk – probability of default use company information, such as in a company’s financial statements, to help estimate the  • Embeds  uncertainty  of cash ﬂows (spread of the distribution), and  price  (compensation for uncertainty)

• History: GT10 <govt> FIS 5 10/25  $<$  corp> SGIP – then “Actions - View Spread”  
# Risk Premium From Market Yields  

For FIS 31-dec-2015, decompose sensitivity into  discounting  and  credit  

• UST:   $2.25\%$   coupon, 15-nov-25 P=99.84375, Y=2.268%sab  

• FIS: 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 P=103.626, Y=4.536%sab  

Usually use approximation  

•    $r p\approx y-y_{u s t}$  •   $227\mathrm{bp}=4.54\%-2.27\%$  

Overall (risky) yield separates into two parts:  

[^1]: UST (risk-free) discounting   $\left(y_{u s t}\right)$   – overall market 2. Risk premium   $(r p)$   – speciﬁc to FIS (or whatever company)

 !500  

# Alternative (less useful): Risk Premium in Dollars  

Risk Premium   $\left(1\!+\!r p\right)$   tells us value or price of uncertainty in rate or yield terms Can also measure in up-front dollar terms  

• Discount FIS at UST (risk-free) yield: what FIS  would  be if certain CFs • FIS: 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 (31-dec-15)   $\mathrm{Y{=}4.536\%}$  , P=103.626  

 !500  
$\bullet$   FIS: 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 (31-dec-15) Y=2.268%, P=123.859  

 !500  

Di!erence –   $\S20.23$   – is   $\S$   value of uncertainty • But less useful than risk premium in yield (227bp) • 227bp applies every year, to any similar CFs

# Bankruptcy Costs  

Bankruptcy does have costs, can be long & expensive process  

• Direct costs – Pay lawyers, accountants –  Enron – \$757mn in legal, accounting, other –  Lehman – likely as much as \$1,500mn • Indirect costs – many – eg customers, employees leave –  Big issue in 2008 ﬁnancial crisis – huge disruption when ﬁnancial ﬁrm goes under  

Evidence  

• Di"cult to estimate, but cost might be something like 3% of total (book) assets, 20% of market value of equity • Best evidence – reluctance of creditors to push insolvent ﬁrms (MV assets   $<$   MV liabilities) into bankruptcy (transfer assets to creditors) –  Often, creditors would rather have managers and shareholders try to get back to health  

# Corporate & Sovereign Default  

Corporate Default & Bankruptcy  

• Transfer of ownership • Bankruptcy is a beautiful thing – allows ﬁrms to make mistakes • Depends on national laws – legal ownership & transfer  

Sovereign Default  

• State refuses to pay • But creditors cannot take ownership –  In general – except see Newfoundland 1928-1933 (R&R p. 81) –  “sovereign but bankrupt Newfoundland absorbed by Canada”  

# Default vs Re-Scheduling  

Default is non-payment, Re-Scheduling changing the terms Economically the same  

• Default: usually get something back • Re-Scheduling: change the terms (eg lower coupon) – e!ective default Greece o!cially launched a bond swap Friday [24-feb-2012], aiming to wipe 107 billion euros (\$142 billion) o" its 350-billion-euro debt bill. The debt write-down, also known as haircut, hits private investors hard. As part of the deal [debt swap] – also known as a haircut – private creditors are asked to trade in their Greek bonds for new ones o"ering lower interest rates and longer maturities [pushing the €100 principal further away].  

History: France in early 1700s: reduced coupon on  rentes Britain: often reduced interest on Consols – but redeemable  

• Rates   $3\%$  , £4 annuity worth £133. • Redeem for £100, re-issue new £3 annuity. Or just reduce to £3  
(a) p 61. Greece: “As part of the deal [debt swap] – also known as a haircut – private creditors are asked to trade in their Greek bonds for new ones o!ering lower interest rates and longer maturities [pushing the   $\mathrm{{6100}}$   principal further away]. Bond holders are expected to take a nominal loss of   $53.5\%$   on their holdings, which equates to a real loss of 73 to 74%.” (web, http://www.dw.com/en/greek-creditors-receive-o"cial-haircutnot i cation/a-15767530, early 2012) “Greece o"cially launched a bond swap Friday [24- feb-2012], aiming to wipe 107 billion euros (  $\S142$   billion) o! its 350-billion-euro debt bill. The debt write-down, also known as haircut, hits private investors hard.”  

(b) France: reduced coupons on  rentes  – a form of re-scheduling and thus default (c) Britain: often reduced coupon on Consols  

i. But this is interesting – not a re-scheduling. ii. Consols redeemable annuities – callable at £100. Often the government would ﬁnd it easier to have investors take a reduce coupon rather than redeem the existing bonds and then re-issue at new (lower) coupon iii. Rates   $3\%$  : Annuity of   $£4$   is worth £  $4/.03=£133$  . Can redeem at £100, then re-issue new annuity at   $£3$   coupon, worth £100.

Spread measures market’s perception (and valuation) for uncertainty Brazil: low coupon but low price    $\Rightarrow$  high yield: 195bp over UST • Always look at yield as  spread  to bond with known CFs (UST)  

# 3-oct-18 from FT Remember CF Adjustment Idea  

• Use expected utility to get the CE (single, certainty equivalent CF)  

• Adjust the original CFs until the average (or promised) CF from the distribution equals the CE  

• Apply the adjustment   $\&$   discounting together: risk-adjusted discounting  
$$
P V={\frac{C E}{1+u s t}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{p r o m}}{\left(1+y_{r i s k y}\right)}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{p r o m}}{\left(1+u s t\right)\left(1+r p\right)}}

# Let’s Apply CF Adjustment to Brazil  

•  Adjust CFs as a ratio 1/(1+rp)  

• Apply the adjustment & discounting separately: ﬁrst adjust CFs, then discount  
$$

# Credit Spread: Market Measure of “Default”  

“Credit Spread”: yield relative to low-risk yield – UST

Measure relative to “certainty yield” for known   $\mathrm{CF\mathrm{~-~}U S T}$  Compensation for extra risk of default (over UST), set by market • Brazil 1/23: 5yr UST 2.94%.  $\mathrm{Speed}=4.89-2.94=1.95\%$   or 195bp Details on credit spread (risk-premium) calculation  
$$
[^1]: +Y_{r i s k y}=(1+u s t)(1+r p)=1+u s t+r p+u s t\cdot r p\approx1+u s t+r p\Rightarrow r p\approx Y_{r i s k y}-u s t
$$  
$$
[^1]: +Y_{B r a z i l}=(1+Y_{U S T})(1+r p)\approx1+Y_{U S T}+r p\Rightarrow r p\approx Y_{B r a z i l}-Y_{U S T}
$$  

Turkey: Higher spread, market says more chance of default  

• Believe market before credit-rating agencies • Rating agencies say Brazil BB-, Turkey BB • Market says Brazil 195bp, Turkey 379bp  
# Term Structure of Default Spread  

Credit Spreads di!er across maturity as well as across issuers • Di!erences bigger and more important across issuers  

 !500  

Term structure (maturity) di!erences due to changing likelihood over time • Often see rising pattern – more and better knowledge about close-in events  

• Could also go other way – falling risk premium –  Big events close in, then problems get better –  Don’t make mistake to think premium rises because of longer maturity: Risk premium measures  per year  compensation for uncertainty  

NB: 3-oct-18 from FT gives price and yield for Brazil   $5.63\%$   of 2/47 (as above) but does not report the spread to UST. They report the UST   $2.75\%$   of 11/47 as yielding   $3.20\%$  , which gives spread shown above.

• For Greece,  380 bp spread  ↔ 5 . 31%  intensity • Spread: for bonds, usual “promised” CFs  

• Intensity: for di!erent CFs like CDS – see my “Practical Guide” in week 4 module

Credit Spread for Europe Germany is the “safe” country Measure France, Italy, Spain, Belgium relative to Germany  

[^1]: Digression on credit spreads

(a) Important point: default (or re-scheduling) does not mean investors are irrational or lose by investing in bonds that eventually default  

i. Often investors receive a higher coupon or higher yield that compensates for the chance of default ii. Bonds, like any ﬁnancial security, are simply a game of expectations – you pay today with some chance of getting money in the future.  

(b) Credit spreads as of 24-apr-17 (from FT)  

 !500  

(c) Credit spreads as of 3-oct-18 (from FT)  

 !500  

(d) “Yield” correctly measures how much you earn – it trades of the lower price (you buy the bond cheaper) and higher coupon (you earn more each year).  
i. Take the Brazil 12.50% of 1/31/22. Very high coupon is good (earn a lot each year) but you have to pay a lot up-front (  $\S$  111.029). Net you earn 9.49% ii. Still, this is much higher than for US go’vt bonds – similar maturity UST is the  $1.875\%$   of 03/22 with yield of 1.81%. Spread of 768bp. (e) Credit spread incorporates both the  probability  of the default and the  value  of the loss – how much investors are hurt by the loss. i. Incorporates recovery – default usually does not mean you lose all \$100  

# Valuation with Risk-Neutral Valuation  

Everything we’ve done so far has been “risk-premium” where we adjust the CF distribution by adjusting the CFs. But alternatively we can adjust the probabilities and then use the distribution itself. We might want to do this when we want to look at the CFs. We could build a model where each coupon date (more technically each instant) there are two possibilities: 1) the bond defaults and pays a “recovery value”; 2) the bond continues to the next period.  

For those interested in this kind of valuation (which is used for valuing Credit Default Swaps (CDS)) look at Section V in my “Practical Guide to Yield Curves ...” on Canvas, or my paper at SSRN: https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract  $,=$  1555118

# Bond Ratings & Credit Spread – Both Measure Default Risk  

Remember: credit spread (risk premium) depends on  CF distribution  – uncertainty • Embeds both uncertainty (probability of default) & risk (value of default)  

Rating supposed to measure just probability of default Biggest di!erence: spread comes from the market  

• Both should move together – depend on default prob • Spread may move faster, embed up-to-minute information  

Believe spread over rating Example : Verizon vs BAC (Bank of America) in Oct 2010  

• Verizon 7.375% of 9/12: A/A3, spread 64bp • BAC 4.88% of 1/13: A/A2, spread 207bp • Rating agencies say same risk, market says BAC much higher risk.  

Example : Mortgage CDOs in 2005  

• Trading CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations) • Rated AAA, spread 30-40bp over libor; AAA corporate bonds 5-10bp • Clearly not the same, and people knew mortgage risk was higher  

# Complaints About Ratings – Corporate Bonds OK  

Many complaints about ratings and rating agencies:  

• Potential conﬂicts (bond issuers pay for ratings) • Regulated oligopoly • Horribly wrong about mortgages in 2008 • Venturing into new products where agencies don’t know as much –  Potential for issuers (banks) to “game” agency models  

Many of these criticisms valid  

• And I would always trust market spread ﬁrst: thousands or millions of people buying-andselling, evaluating the company or bond  

But for standard corporate bonds and sovereigns, agencies reliable

Our original CFs and expected utility give CE of   $\S764.28$  Adjust distribution by one of two ways so dist’n gives CE:  

• “Risk-adjusted discounting”, Adjust CFs by 1/1.0467, same probabilities, discount at    $(1+$   $u s t)\cdot(1+r p)$  

• “Risk-neutral discounting”, Adjust probabilities, same CFs, discount at    $(1+u s t)$  
# When to Adjust CFs or Adjust Probabilities?  

Adjust CFs : When using  promised  or  expected  Cash Flows  

•  Promised  CF or  Expected  CF summarize full distribution in one number • Risk premium ( rp ) adjusts Promised or Expected to Certainty Equivalent (CE)  

Adjust Probabilities : When using the distribution itself  

• Options: take only good outcomes (you pay upfront) • In our simple example: get to keep building in “good” outcome  

• Cannot use risk premium – look at only part of the distribution – only \$888.59

# 2.1 We Think We’re Smart – But Can’t PV FIS  

# Contents  

We Think We’re Smart, But Why Di!erent Yields for UST & FIS? Turns out we don’t even how to PV our FIS bond Let’s look at UST & FIS, and calculate yields • UST:   $2.25\%$   coupon, 15-nov-25 (31-dec-15) P=99.84375, Y=2.268%  

 !500  

• FIS: 30/360, semi 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 (31-dec-15) P=103.626, Y=4.536%  

 !500  

These UST and FIS prices (and yields) are from December 2015. Our Discounting for FIS Totally Wrong  
• UST: 2.25% coupon, 15-nov-25 (31-dec-15) P=99.84375, Y=2.268% • FIS: 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 (31-dec-15) P=103.626, Y=4.536%  

This cannot be right – such huge discounting di!erences We should discount CFs at (roughly) same rate. Problem is  promised CFs :  

• The UST CFs will be paid; the FIS promise may be broken • FIS maybe  $90\%$   chance  $\S5$  , but   $10\%$   \$0. Can’t even draw CF diagram!  

Fact is, we don’t really have a clue how to PV the FIS bond!  

 !500  

We often draw the future FIS cash ﬂows as if they were a single value but what we always put down is the “promised” CF, or maybe the expected (average) CF. That simple diagram misleads us into thinking that we understand when in fact we don’t have a clue  

# CF Diagrams Misleading – Can’t Discount (so far)  

We draw FIS and UST same way – but actually very di!erent • UST: actual known future CFs – we discount to get PV:  $\textstyle{\frac{C F}{(1+y)^{n}}}$  

 !500  

Pictures make it look like we can discount, but we can’t (so far)  

Let’s turn to a simpliﬁed example to show us why we can’t do simple discounting, and how we can get back to something that looks and acts like simple discounting.

# Framework for Discounting Uncertain CFs  

Theory issues we need to address  

• What do we mean when we say “uncertain cash ﬂows”? (Answer: Cash ﬂow distribution – graph of amount versus probability) • Why can’t we just use discounting as we have for certain (known) cash ﬂows? (Answer: Multiple values, using average CFs simply does not work – Expected utility and concavity.) • What is uncertainty versus risk? (Answer: Uncertainty = distribution; risk = cost or price of uncertainty – Certainty Equivalent.) • How do we adjust for uncertainty? (Answer: Adjust cash ﬂow distribution until the expected value of the adjusted CFs equals the CE.)  

Practical issue we need to address  

• We want a method that works just like discounting, so we can use all the PV and NPV ideas we have worked on  

# We Have Two Methods – Risk-Adjusted & Risk-Neutral  

Both methods adjust the CF distribution Risk-Adjusted Discounting – we use this most often  

• Adjust CFs themselves • But looks like discounting:    $\begin{array}{r}{C F_{a d j}=\frac{C F_{o r i g}}{1+r p}}\end{array}$  then    $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{C F_{a d j}}{1+y}}\end{array}$  • Used for most of our problems Risk-Neutral Discounting – use this for options • Adjust probabilities • Used for derivatives, mainly options • “Risk-neutral valuation” is bad name – really “Risk-adjusted probabilities”  

You won’t read this lecture in most texts, but it is the way things work  

The “problem” with risk-adjusted discounting (risk premium) is that it works so well we forget that we are in fact adjusting the whole distribution, and we start thinking we are discounting the average value. But really what we are doing is  

[^1]: Adjusting the CF  distribution  until the average of this adjusted distribution equals the certainty equivalent

• This removes the risk premium – produces the certainty equivalent • We do this b multiplicative ly adjusting the whole distribution

# Averaging Utility – Not CFs  

We want  utility  or  value  of those two possibilities We have to average the  utility  not CFs (expected utility not expected CF)  
$$
E U=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})\neq u\left(p\cdot C_{l}+(1-p)\cdot C_{h}\right)
$$  

To make concrete,  Constant Relative Risk Aversion :    $\begin{array}{r}{u(C)=\frac{C^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}}\end{array}$  , with    $\gamma=8$  

 !500  

But we can always ask “what single CF is equivalent to our utility?” Solve for  Certainty Equivalent :  
$$
U\left(C_{C E}\right)=E U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  
$\gamma=8$   (a reasonable number which produces reasonable risk aversion)  

# Certainty Equivalent – CF that Gives Correct Utility  

 !500  

Solve for  Certainty Equivalent :  
$$
U\left(C_{C E}\right)=E U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  

Avg utility (exp utility), not CF (exp CF)  
$$
E U=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})\neq u\left(p\cdot C_{l}+(1-p)\cdot C_{h}\right)
$$  

But we can always ask “what single CF is equivalent to our utility?” Call this  certainty equivalent  

To make concrete,  Constant Relative Risk Aversion  function:    $\begin{array}{r}{u(C)\ =\ \frac{C^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}}\end{array}$  with    $\gamma\:=\:8$   (a → reasonable number which produces reasonable risk aversion)  

 !500  

p  = probability of low outcome  
$C_{l}\,=\,\mathrm{low}$   cash ﬂow (\$711.41k in our example)  $C_{h}\ ={\mathrm{high}}$   cash ﬂow (\$888.59k in our example)  
u(C)  = utility of cash ﬂow    $C$  

# Certainty Equivalent :  
$$
U\left(C_{C E}\right)=E U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  

Expected Utility And Certainty Equivalent  

For our simple distribution (Figure  ?? ) the average of the cash ﬂows (the expected cash ﬂow) is  $\S800\mathrm{k}$  . Most people, however, would rather have   $\S800\mathrm{k}$   for sure (probability 1) rather than a 50/50 chance of high or low - most people are risk averse. Whatever the attitude towards risk, we can use utility theory and represent the value in expected utility terms:  
$$
E U=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  

where  
$\textdollar{p}$   = probability of low outcome  
$c_{l}\,=\,\mathrm{low}$   cash ﬂow (\$711.41k in our example)  $C_{h}\ ={\mathrm{high}}$   cash ﬂow (\$888.59k in our example)  

u(C)  = utility of cash ﬂow    $C$  

The fundamental issue is that utility is usually not linear   $\langle u(Y)\neq Y\rangle$  ) and so the expected utility does not equal the utility of expected income:    $E U\neq u\left(p\cdot Y_{l}+(1-p)\cdot Y_{h}\right)$  . If utility were linear then we would have risk neutrality and we could just take expectations.  

We can, however, calculate what cash ﬂow would correspond to the expected utility EU (-9.4E-22 for our sample utility function). This is the Certainty Equivalent, the single cash ﬂow that is valued the same (in utility terms) as the distribution of the two cash ﬂows,   $\S711.41$   and   $\S888.59$  . We just need to solve  
$$
C_{h})=U\left(C_{l},C_{h}\right)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  

In our case (with our sample CRRA utility function,    $\gamma=8$  ), this is:  
$$
-9.378E-22={\frac{C_{C E}^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}}
$$  

and the Certainty Equivalent turns out to be   $\S764.28$  . This is the certain cash ﬂow with the same value as the distribution of cash ﬂows. More generally, the certainty equivalent is the solution to:  
$$
u(C E)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  

It is no accident that the certainty equivalent from our utility example is the same as the market value, the certain value determined by the market. In a sense, this has to be the case: the market & value is the cash value adjusted for the risk of the distribution of risky cash ﬂows.  
# 3.2 Risk-Adjusted Discounting: Adjust CFs  

# Contents  

 !500  
# Adjusting CFs by Risk Premium – To Use Original Average  

We have multiple steps: 1.  Get CE (certainty equivalent) from dist’n using utility  
$$
u(C E)=p\cdot u(C_{l})+(1-p)\cdot u(C_{h})
$$  
$$
u(746.28)={\frac{1}{2}}\cdot u(711.41)+{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot u(888.59)
$$  

[^2]: Adjust CFs so they average to CE:
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{C E=p\cdot C F_{a d j}^{l o}+(1-p)\cdot C F_{a d j}^{h i}}}\\ {{\ }}\\ {{764.28=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\cdot679.66+\frac{1}{2}\cdot848.93}}\end{array}
$$  

[^3]: Write adjustment as   $\textdollar{1}\sqrt{\textdollar{1}+\textdollar{r p}}$  :
$$
C E=p\cdot\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{l o}}{1+r p}+(1-p)\cdot\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{h i}}{1+r p}
$$  
$$
C E=\frac{1}{1+r p}\left[p\cdot C F_{o r i g}^{l o}+(1-p)\cdot C F_{o r i g}^{h i}\right]=\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{1+r p}
$$  
$$
C E=p\cdot\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{l o}}{1+r p}+(1-p)\cdot\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{h i}}{1+r p}
$$  
$$
[^764]: 28={\frac{1}{1+.04673}}\left[{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot711.41+{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot888.59\right]={\frac{800}{1+.04673}}
$$  

[^4]: Discount CE at risk-free, original avg CF at    $\boldsymbol{r}f\,+\,\boldsymbol{r}p$  :
$$
P V={\frac{C E}{1+r f}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{\left(1+r f\right)\left(1+r p\right)}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{\left(1+y_{r i s k y}\right)}}
$$  
$$
[^714]: 29={\frac{764.29}{1+.07}}={\frac{800}{\left(1+.07\right)\left(1+.04673\right)}}={\frac{800}{\left(1+.12\right)}}
$$  

Looks like regular yield-to-maturity, just a higher “risk-adjusted” rate Now perform a backwards trick: adjust CFs (via    $\begin{array}{r}{C F_{a d j}=\frac{C F_{o r i g}}{1+r p})}\end{array}$  ) so that  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{C E=p\cdot C F_{a d j}^{l o}+(1-p)\cdot C F_{a d j}^{h i}}}\\ {{\ }}\\ {{764.28=\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\cdot679.66+\frac{1}{2}\cdot848.93\;.}}\end{array}
$$  

This looks pretty arbitrary but it turns out to be very general and works wonderfully well. Let’s continue on for a moment and write this adjustment as 1/1+rp):  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{C E=p\cdot\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{l o}}{1+r p}+(1-p)\cdot\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{h i}}{1+r p}}\\ {=\frac{1}{1+r p}\left[p\cdot C F_{o r i g}^{l o}+(1-p)\cdot C F_{o r i g}^{h i}\right]}\\ {=\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{1+r p}}\end{array}
$$  

Now we have something that looks surprisingly like discounting. In fact, we can now discount back to today because the Certainty Equivalent is a known and certain cash ﬂow so we can discount with the risk-free rate, just as we have been doing for any known cash ﬂow:  
$$
P V={\frac{C E}{1+r f}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{\left(1+r f\right)\left(1+r p\right)}}={\frac{C F_{o r i g}^{a v g}}{\left(1+y_{r i s k y}\right)}}
$$  

So now we can use the average CF (or promised CF) from the distribution, which is usually easy to get, and use this single number to discount in the way we always have, but with the additional adjustment of the  $\textstyle{\frac{1}{1+r p}}$  .

$$  

The UST CFs are known, the FIS only  promised  CFs, but CF diagram useful We can just calculate yield, market gives us risk premium!  

 !500  

Generally use spread:   $\mathrm{rp}=4.54\%-2.27\%=227\mathrm{bp}$  
# Risk Premium From Market Yields  

For FIS 31-dec-2015, decompose sensitivity into  discounting  and  credit  

• UST:   $2.25\%$   coupon, 15-nov-25 P=99.84375, Y=2.268%sab  

• FIS: 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 P=103.626, Y=4.536%sab  

Usually use approximation  

•    $r p\approx y-r f$  •   $227\mathrm{bp}=4.54\%-2.27\%$  

Overall (risky) yield separates into two parts:  

[^1]: Risk-free discounting   $(r f)$   – overall market 2. Risk premium   $(r p)$   – speciﬁc to FIS (or whatever company)

 !500  

# Alternative (less useful): Risk Premium in Dollars  

Risk Premium   $\left(1\!+\!r p\right)$   tells us value or price of uncertainty in rate or yield terms Can also measure in up-front dollar terms  

• Discount FIS at UST (risk-free) yield   $(2.268\%)$  ): what FIS  would  be if certain CFs • FIS: 5% coupon, 15-oct-25 (31-dec-15)   $\mathrm{Y{=}4.536\%}$  , P=103.626

Di!erence –   $\S$  20.23 – is   $\S$   value of uncertainty • But less useful than risk premium in yield (227bp) • 227bp applies every year, to any similar CFs

• Sometimes structured in tranches ordered in terms of payment priority  

# Examples  

• Mutual Funds  

• Hedge Funds  

• Mortgage-backed securities.md)  

–  Pass-through (Agency – Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac – pass-throughs). Simply pool together a group of mortgages and pass through the income – payment of income and principal. –  Tanched. Pool together a group of mortgages but sell di!erent  

• Other Asset-Backed securities – student loans, credit card receivable s, even David Bowie’s bond (1997 – revenues from 25 albums recorded before 1990)  

• Common Stocks  

–  Not usually talked about as a se curit iz ation or pooled assets, but in many ways that is exactly what a share in a publicly-listed company is – a share in the cash ﬂows generated by the pooled activities from the company. –  Usually we talk about se curit iz ation of passive assets (things like other bonds or mortgages) and not active assets like for an on-going business. –  This ties back nicely to the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co, although the South Sea Co was truly a pooling of passive assets – simply government annuities  

• Distinction between “equity”-type pools and “bond”-type pools  

–  Equity-type: mutual funds, hedge funds, ETFs. For these the investors get a proportionate share of whatever proﬁts –  Bond-type: Senior tranches for tranched securities: promised CFs. Here investors are promised a CF. The pooling is valuable usually because it improves divers i cation and makes the “promise” more reliable, more certain to be paid.  

# Legal Structure  

• “Fund” and “Manager” separate legal entities  

–  Manager may be Corporation –  Fund often a Trust or a Partnership or itself a Corporation –  The Fund hires the the manager and pays a fee plus various expenses –  The Fund will often have a Board of Directors who represent the interests of the shareholders (owners of the Fund and thus bene cia ries of the fund’s assets) –  Assets are held in custody for the fund. Custodian is hired by the Fund, legally responsible to the fund and the Board  

• Mutual Funds in US –  Investment Company (fund) which holds assets and sells shares in itself – proportionate share of cash ﬂows  
–  Investment Manager (manager) who manages the assets of the Investment Company. But a legally separate entity that cannot take the assets from the Investment Company –  Investment Co Act 1940 – sets rules and regulations for Investment Co structure and operations –  Investment Advisors Act 1940 – rules and regulations for managers  

• Hedge Funds –  Often the “Fund” is o!-shore – say Carmen islands – for tax and regulator reasons.  

• Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities (bonds)  

–  Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) – separate legal entity that holds the assets, sells securities that are usually more bond-like than equity-like –  Investors are lending money to the SPV with the promise to get paid back – that promise may be a good or a poor promise.  

# Reasons for se curit iz ation  

• Spreads & Diversiﬁes risk  

–  Big reason for mortgage-backed bonds. If you invest   $\S100\mathrm{k}$   in one mortgage then if the homeowner defaults you are out. There may be only a 5% chance but on that you lose everything. But if you invest   $\S100\mathrm{k}$   in a mortgage-backed bond with 1,000 mortgages then there’s a pretty good chance that 5% will default but then you only lose 5%, and in any case you can price that in up-front because it becomes pretty certain how much you will lose (  $5\%$   of your investment) rather than all or nothing.  

• Lowers cost of access (mutual funds) or provides professional management expertise (hedge funds)  

–  One of the biggest reasons for mutual funds and ETFs

 • Helps monitor and discipline (maybe 1720, South Sea & Mississippi)  

–  This may have been a reasons for the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co. Although they did it very poorly – in fact the South Sea managers were really fraudsters. –  But the Bank of England that managed the government debt, while not really pooling the government assets, played this role. –  Not something we think is necessary today for government debt, at least not in developed countries. But in 1720 could have been very valuable.  

• Widens audience and market  

–  For investors can provide access to markets not available otherwise. ∗E.g. for credit-card receivable s, investors would have a hard time investing (buying) except through se curit iz ation. ∗David Bowie’s records is another example – investors could not get invest if not se curit i zed –  For Sponsors / Owners or assets, can be a way to “move assets o! balance-sheet”  $^*$  What this really means is that it is a way to raise money, to borrow – collateralized. ∗e.g. mortgages. A bank makes mortgages, using its money to lend to homeowners. ∗It then pools those mortgages together, puts into an SPV, and sells bonds against those mortgages.  $^*$  The investors are lending to the bank, with the mortgages as collateral.  
# Pass-Through vs Trancheing (Waterfall)  

 !500  

Outline  

• Pass-through: all investors get same CFs  

–  Tranched: sell senior & junior (equity) tranches –  Pre-speciﬁed rules (“waterfall”) for how cash is distributed  

Simple Trancheing Example  

• “Senior”: gets 20% of CFs, ﬁrst priority  

• “Equity”: 80% of CFs, but lowest priority  

• Equity loses money ﬁrst  

Probability of 10% loss – pay back either \$100 or   $\S90$  

• Senior is ﬁrst priority, always gets   $\mathsection$  20 (  $100\%$  ) back • Equity su!ers the loss, gets either   $\S80$   (  $100\%$  ) or \$70 (87.5%)  

• Senior riskless, Equity more risky (lose more than   $10\%$   of original) Pricing (5yr,   $\S5$   coup,   $5\%$   risky,   $4\%$   risk-free yield)  

• Underlying  must be  \$100   $\left(\mathrm{PV}(\S5\ @\ 5\%\right),$  ) • Senior now risk-free,  must be    $\S104.45$   (PV(\$5 @ 4%) – pay   $\S20.89$   for   $20\%$  

• Equity  implied    $\S98.89$   (  $\mathrm{100{=}}.\mathrm{2^{*}104.45{+}.8^{*}98.89)}$  ) – pay   $\S79.11$   for 80%  

 !500  

# Pass-through versus trancheing  

This detail (for example on trancheing) is not necessary for History of Financial Crises – for Applied Financial Management  

• Pass-through: all investors get same cash-ﬂows - proportional to their ownership (investment) • Tranched: the cash-ﬂows are “tranched” according to some set of rules –  Assets pooled, but then cash ﬂows are “tranched” according to some rule, and di!erent classes of securities (shares in the pool) sold.  
• Example:  

–    $\S100$   of mortgages. –  Mortgage is 5yrs, 5% coupon, pays back   $\S100$   in 5 years. Price \$100,   $\mathrm{yId}=5\%$  
$^*$  Current risk-free rate is 4%. 100bp spread (risky 5%, risk-free 4%)  

–  But this mortgage is risky. 54% chance that   $10\%$   of the mortgages will default on the ﬁnal principal repayment  

∗54% chance that all coupons will be paid but that   $10\%$   of the mortgages will not repay the ﬁnal   $\S100$   $^*$  in other words 54% chance you get \$90 instead of   $\S100$   at the end  

–  Trancheing can change the risk proﬁle. Here will will tranche into senior (with no risk) and equity (with the remaining or residual or increased risk)  

–  Make 2 tranches: Split   $100\%$   (100 shares) into top 20% and bottom 80%  
$^*$  Top tranche is called the “senior” tranche –   $20\%$   of this pool is “senior”  $^*$  Bottom tranche is called “equity” tranche –   $80\%$   of this pool is “equity”  $^*$  Senior tranche (top   $20\%$  ) gets ﬁrst priority for cash ﬂows – either coupon or principal. Every   $\S1$   that is supposed to come in, these shares get the ﬁrst   $20\Phi$   $^*$  Equity tranche (bottom   $80\%$  ) gets whatever is left. Every   $\S1$   that is supposed to come in, these shares get whatever is left after paying the 20¢ to the top tranche  $^*$  Example:   $\S100$   is promised. \$90 comes in. Senior tranche gets   $\S20$   (20% of the   $\S100$  promised). Equity tranche gets   $\S70$   (what is left). Since the equity tranche was promised   $\S80$  , this   $\S70$   is only   $87.5\%$   of what they were promised. ∗Result: Overall loss was   $10\%$   (promised   $\S100$  , paid   $\S90$  ). Senior tranche loss was   $0\%$  (promised \$20, paid   $\S20$  ). Equity tranche loss was   $12.5\%$   (promised \$80, paid   $\S70$  ).  Senior tranche has reduced risk, equity tranche increased risk  

• Example of cash ﬂow tranche or cash-ﬂow cascade or waterfall (with 20% senior, 80% equity)  

Promised   $\mathrm{CF}=\S100$  , Actual   $\mathrm{CF}=\S100$  
 !500  
How do we price this? Actually very easy in this case.  

• We know the price of the risky mortgages (  $\S100$  , 5% yield) and the risk-free rate (  $4\%$  , for risk-free cash ﬂows)  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{~-~PV}(\mathrm{rky~mortgages})=\S100}&{}\\ {\mathrm{~-~PV}(5\%~\mathrm{coopen}\ @\ 4\%\ \mathrm{yield})=104.4518}\end{array}
$$  

• The senior tranche is now risk-free so this must be priced at   $\mathbb{S}104.4518$  . We are selling   $20\%$   of the shares at this price, so this is   $\S20.8904$   (  $\mathbb{S}104.4518^{*}0.20)$  . The balance we have to sell at  $\S79.1096$   (to make the total   $\S100$  )  

 !500  
Details for pricing of “mortgage bond”  

• 5-year, 5% annual coupon,   $\S{100}$   bullet re-payment (not amortizing like a true mortgage). • Chance that   $10\%$   of mortgages will fail to repay principal • Price \$100, so yield (risky yield) 5% • Risk-free rate   $4\%$  , so risk-free bond PV(5yr bond, 5% coupon,  $4\%{\mathrm{~yield}})=\S104.4518$  • Assume that all coupons paid with certainty,   $10\%$   of principal will default with some probability (either no-default and get   $\S100$  , or yes-default at year 5 and get \$90) • Use risk-neutral (risk-adjusted) pricing:  $\begin{array}{c}{{P V(r i s k y\,5\%\,c o u o n\,@\,4\%\,r i s k-f r e e)}}\\ {{=P V(\S5\,a n n u i t y\,@4\%)+(1-\phi)\cdot P V(\S100\,@\,4\%)+\phi\cdot P V(\S90\,@\,4\%)}}\end{array}$  Implies (risk-neutral) probability of default is    $\phi=54.16\%$  • PV of tranched risky bond with recovery   $87.5\%$   (using risk-neutral pricing):  $\begin{array}{r l}&{\qquad\qquad P V(t r a n c h e d\,5\%\,c o u o n\,@\,4\%\,r i s k-f r e e)}\\ &{=P V(\S5\,a n n u i t y\,@4\%)+(1-\phi)\cdot P V(\S100\,@\,4\%)+\phi\cdot P V(\S87.5\,@\,4\%)}\end{array}$   Bond is tranched   $20\%$   senior,   $80\%$   equity:

• 5yr, 1.721%sab coupon (& yield)  

Naïvely, “Yield Curve” connects dots  
# Bring in 5-year: Shows Problem with Naïve Yield-to-Maturity  

Yield-to-Maturity: discount each bond at own rate But cannot be the right way: cash ﬂows overlap  

•  Law of One Price : Discount  all  CFs during yr 1 & 2 at same rate • We know rate is  $1.162\%$   for yr 1 & 2  

 !500  

Yield for 5yr bond is complicated average of 0-2 and 2-5 yr rates  

# Must Discount CFs at Same (Consistent) Forward Rates  

We know    $f_{0\to2}=1.162\%$   – discount coupons for yr 1 & 2 at   $1.162\%$  

 !500  

Now bonds consistent – just need to solve for    $f_{2\rightarrow5}=\mathrm{??}$  
# Graphing Yield-to-Maturity – Results  

Three graphs saying the same in di!erent ways 1. Yield-to-maturity: treat each bond in its own world 2. Zero rate: rate  from today to some date  (e  $\S~0\rightarrow2y r$  ,    $0\rightarrow5y r$  ) 3. Forward rate: rate  between dates  (  $\mathrm{eg\2}y r\rightarrow5y r$  ) Look at some actual bonds prices & yields:

NB - this is using  $2\ \mathrm{p/yr}$  The point here is that we know the  $0{>}2$   year rate from the 2-yr bond. We should use that, and then ask “what is the   ${\mathrm{2->5~yr}}$   forward?”

# Zero Rates as “Average” of Forward Rates (Annual Compounding)  

The zero rate will be some sort of an “average” of forward rates. • Let’s consider rates for 2 years, annually-compounded.  

• The formula is:  
$$
(1+z_{2})=[\left(1+f_{0\rightarrow.1}\right)\left(1+f_{1\rightarrow2}\right)]^{1/2}
$$  

We get this by comparing the formula for the PV of a single cash ﬂow, discounting by zero rates ! ! versus forward rates:  
$$
P V={\frac{C F}{\left(1+z_{2}\right)^{2}}}\Rightarrow\left(1+z_{2}\right)^{2}={\frac{C F}{P V}}
$$  
$$
P V={\frac{C F}{\left(1+f_{0\rightarrow.1}\right)\left(1+f_{1\rightarrow2}\right)}}\Rightarrow\left(1+f_{0\rightarrow1}\right)\left(1+f_{1\rightarrow2}\right)={\frac{C F}{P V}}
$$  

! ! $$
\left(1+z_{2}\right)^{2}=\left(1+f_{0\rightarrow1}\right)\left(1+f_{1\rightarrow2}\right)
$$  
$$
(1+z_{2})=[\left(1+f_{0\rightarrow1}\right)\left(1+f_{1\rightarrow2}\right)]^{1/2}
$$
 ! !  

Messy, but not horrible. More generally, for the zero rate for  yr  years:  
$$
(1+z_{y r})=[\left(1+f_{0\rightarrow1}\right)(1+f_{1\rightarrow2})\cdot\cdot\cdot(1+f_{y r-1\rightarrow y r})]^{1/y r}
$$  

# Yield as “Average” of Forward Rates (Annual Compounding)  

We can also think of the yield-to-maturity for a speciﬁc bond (say a 2-year annual-coupon bond that pays 1.162 per year)  

• The yield will also be an “average” of forward rates. But terribly messy. Once again, compare the PV using yield and PV using forwards:  
$$
F w d:\;P V={\frac{1.162}{(1+f_{0\rightarrow1})}}+{\frac{1.162}{(1+f_{0\rightarrow1})(1+f_{1\rightarrow2})}}+{\frac{100}{(1+f_{0\rightarrow1})(1+f_{1\rightarrow2})}}
$$  

! ! ! $$
Y T M:\ P V={\frac{1.162}{(1+y)}}+{\frac{1.162}{(1+y)^{2}}}+{\frac{100}{(1+y)^{2}}}
$$  

No simple formula to calculate the YTM as the “average” of forwards:  

[^1]: Calculate the PV from the Fo  $\left(P V=P V\left(f_{0\rightarrow1},f_{1\rightarrow2},c o u p o n=1.162\right)\right)$  ) 2. Calculate the YTM from the  $P V\left(f_{0\rightarrow1},f_{1\rightarrow2},c o u p o n=1.162\right)$  3. YTM function of forwards and coupon: !  (  $(y=y\,(f_{0\rightarrow1},f_{1\rightarrow2},c o u p o n=1.162)$  ! !

YTM for each bond will be its own average

What is PV for 4yr,   $2\%$   bond? Or swap? Break into two as before 1. Bond from yr 4 back to yr 2: 2yr   $2\%$   coupon bond at   $2.111\%\mathrm{sab}$  2. “Bond” from yr 2 (FV not 100) back to yr 0: 2yr  $2\%$   “bond” (with FV not 100) at   $1.162\%$

# 4yr,   $2\%$   bond, PV = 101.4406

 !500  

 !500  

Note a few things:  

• Previous version of this slide had “yield  $\mathbf{\lambda=}1.574^{\circ}$   but this was an error by leaving FV=99.7837  

• YTM for this 4yr 2% coupon bond is   $1.627\%$  . But the par rate for this set of forwards is  $1.6282\%$  . The di!erence is (of course) because the par bond is the coupon (  $\&$   yield) for a bond with PV=100.  

The formula for a par bond is  
$$
[^100]: =c\cdot P V(\S1\,a n n u i t y)+P V(\S100)
$$  

In this case  

 !500  
 !500  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{100=c\cdot P V(\S1\,a n n u i t y)+P V(\S100)}\\ {100=c\cdot3.874974+93.690678}\end{array}
$$  

and so  c  = 1 . 6282

But what if pays every 6mths (like UST)? Get   $\S3.25$   every half-year. • Seems natural to use annual rate, for “number of years” (may be 1/2 year):  
$$

# But No – Periodic CFs – Discount at Same Freq as Payment  

Example: 4yr semi-annual   $6.5\%$   coupon bond,   $\mathrm{P}=99.658-3.25\%/6\mathrm{m}\mathrm{th}$  • Seems natural to use annual rate, discount “number of years”:  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1/2}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1.5}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$  

But that’s far too simple. Instead, discount at same freq as payment:  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{1}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{3}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{8}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{8}}
$$  

Discount at a 6-mth (half-yr) rate,    $y_{s a b}/2$  

• 1st payment in 1 half-yr,    $[^1]\!/\!1\!+\!y s a b/2$  • 2nd payment in 2 half-yrs,    $1/(1+y s a b/2)^{2}$  

• etc up to 8th payment (4 yrs)  

Why    $y_{s a b}/25$  ? Report “annual” rate  

• Discount at half-yr rate    $y_{s a b}/2$  , but quote “annual”    $y_{s a b}=2\cdot y_{s a b}/2$

# Don’t Be Fooled : 4yr Annual  4yr Semi-Annual  

 !500  
# Complication: Compounding!  

Among the most di!cult things you’ll learn – compounding is confusing You can quote the yield on various  bases :  

Annual:  (aka “ab”) annual rate compounded by years  

Semi-annual:  (aka “sab”) semi-annual rate compounded by half-years  
$$
\begin{array}{r c c}{{\S100\ i n\ 1y r:}}&{{\ a n n u a l}}&{{s e m i-a n n u a l}}\\ {{\ }}&{{92.59={\frac{100}{(1+.08)}}}}&{{92.59={\frac{100}{(1+.07846/2)^{2}}}}}\end{array}
$$  

CFs same (that’s what we buy   $\&$   sell). • “Yield” is convenient way to write PV  $<->$   FV relations • Compounding and “basis” is code to tell you how to write PV relation AND, everyone likes to see an “annual” rate, so write  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{a b})^{Y r}}}&{{}P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{s a b}/2)^{2*Y r}}}\end{array}
$$  

This gives    $y_{s a b}\!=\,.07846\,=\,\mathcal{2}^{*}.0\mathcal{3}\mathcal{9}\mathcal{2}\mathcal{3}$  

# Some Tips on Compounding  

The most common “bases” or compounding frequencies are:  

[^1]: Annual or    $a b$   or annual bond:    $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{a b})^{Y r}}}\end{array}$  • European gov’t bonds, some corporates 2. Semi-annual or    $s a b$   or semi-annual bond:  $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{s a b}/2)^{2*Y r}}}\end{array}$  • US gov’t and corporate bonds 3. Monthly or    $m b$   or monthly bond:  $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{m b}/12)^{12*Y r}}}\end{array}$  • mortgage bonds

NEVER, ever quote a rate without saying what basis   $(a b,\;s a b)$  • And yell at me when I do that (which I will) ALWAYS compare yields of same basis (ab vs ab, sab vs sab)  

# Converting Bases  

Remember, basis or compounding is just a way to quote the yield  

• CFs are what matter  

Always compare same basis  

• ALWAYS need to convert from ab to sab or vice-versa  

Start with fundamental discounting relation:  
$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{(1+y_{a b})=\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}}}&{{}}\\ {{{}}}&{{{}}}\\ {{y_{a b}=\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}-1}}&{{{y_{s a b}=2\cdot\left(\sqrt{1+y_{a b}}-1\right)}}}\end{array}
$$

Build HP  SOLVER  equation:  
$$

$$

But    $y_{a b}\ \&\ y_{s a b}$   fundamentally di!erent  

Need to convert between    $y_{a b}\ \&\ y_{s a b}$  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{y_{a b}=\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}-1}\\ {\mathrm{~}}\\ {y_{s a b}=2\cdot\left(\sqrt{1+y_{a b}}-1\right)}\end{array}
$$
 "  

! " $$
y_{s a b}=2\cdot\left({\sqrt{1+.0660}}-1\right)=.0649
$$  
$$
y_{a b}=\left(1+.06599/2\right)^{2}-1=.06708
$$  

• Annual bond: 6.60%ab or 6.49%sab • Semi-annual:   $6.708\%{\mathrm{ab}}$   or 6.599%sab  

Always  compare bonds on same basis

# 2 Why We Use Yield Instead of Price  

# Contents  

Remember – Price vs Yield – Yield More Comparable Yield has several advantages over price • Comparable across bonds with di"erent coupon, price, maturity Let’s compare 3 bonds (in-class exercise using TVM) 1. 4yr 6.5% bond,   $\mathrm{P}=99.658,\;y i e l d=6.6\theta$  2. 4yr 4% bond,   $\mathrm{P}=91.113\mathrm{~-~}\mathrm{low}$   price  does  o"set low coupon 3. 6yr 7% bond,   $\mathrm{P}=101.930$  ,  yield = 6.60  

All these bonds are more-or-less same “value” (yield 6.60%) Here we can compare three di"erent bonds – same in value   $\&$   how much we earn  

• Yield means discounting: converting between present and future cash –  Flat yield-to-maturity not perfect – Generally “term structure” upward or downward sloping –  Example: UST 2yr 2.88%, 10yr 3.23% (upward) –  Later we look at “term structure of interest rates” and “yield curve” –  But so much better than price alone – balances price vs coupon vs maturity  

Yield is better way to think of “market price” than dollar price  

• Just remember: P  ↔ & Y  ↗  

Yield-to-maturity isn’t perfect, because generally there will be a “term-structure” meaning that CFs with di"erent maturities are discounted at slightly di"erent  

• UST yields quoted in slide: 5-oct-2018 quotes, 2yr 2.75s of 30-sep-20, 10yr 2.875s of 15-aug-28 But YTM is pretty good, and for now we will use YTM, ignoring any issues about term structure  

• Later in the course we will introduce “term structure of interest rates” or “yield curve”

# Some Notes on Deﬁnition and Measurement of BPV  

There are many questions and confusions on how we deﬁne and how we calculate the BPV. Let’s separate the  Deﬁnition  and the  Calculation :  

Deﬁnition :  

• BPV is the derivative of PV w.r.t. yield (changed in sign):    $\ B P V\mathrm{~-~}\frac{\partial P V}{\partial y}$  

• But we have to deﬁne “PV of what?” and “per what change in yield?”  
• For BPV we are saying “PV of a bond with   $\S{100}$   notional, so FV=100” and “per one unit (one percentage point) change in yield” so we are writing yield as a percentage like   $1.50\%$   not as decimal like 0.015”  

• This means we are deﬁning the PV as the derivative for “a \$100 bond, per one percentage point (or 100bp) change in yield”  

• This is our  deﬁnition  of the BPV, deﬁning the units we are using (  $\S$  100 bond, 100bp change in yield)  

# Calculation :  

• Remember that the derivative is deﬁned as the slope  at a point  and to be perfectly accurate we would use the rules of calculus to calculate the derivative  

• Let’s focus on a simple bond, our 4-year   $6.5\%$   coupon bond. Te be perfectly accurate we should write down the PV formula, and then use the rules of calculus to calculate the derivative. For our 4-year annual-coupon bond this would be:  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{P V(y)=\displaystyle\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{1}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{3}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y\right)^{4}}}\\ {\frac{\partial P V(y)}{\partial y}=\displaystyle\frac{-1\times6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}+\frac{-2\times6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{3}}+\frac{-3\times6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{4}}+\frac{-4\times6.5}{\left(1+y\right)^{5}}+\frac{-4\times100}{\left(1+y\right)^{5}}}\end{array}
$$  

• This is messy, and gets to be very very di!cult for anything beyond a simple bond • So instead, let’s go back to the deﬁnition of the derivative:  
$$
{\frac{\partial P V(y)}{\partial y}}=\operatorname*{lim}_{h\to0}{\frac{P V(y+h)-P V(y)}{h}}
$$  

which says we bump he original value up a little (that    $h$  ), take the di"erence    $(P V(y+h)-P V(y))$  and then divide by  h  so that we measure the derivative per one unit change in    $y$  . We do this for smaller-and-smaller bumps    $h$   until we reach the limit.  

• Let’s do that, but instead of just bumping up, we can bump up and down. And instead of taking the limit (as    $h\rightarrow0$  ) let’s just use a small value for    $h$   (and remember to divide by   $2h$  because we are bumping both up and down):  
$$
\frac{\partial P V(y)}{\partial y}\approx\frac{P V(y+h)-P V(y-h)}{2h}
$$  

This is called “ﬁnite di"erent approximation” and is a standard way to calculate an  approximation  to the derivative without having to do the messy formulas.  

# Example :  

Let’s use our 4 year bond, and try three di"erent bump sizes: 3bp, 5bp, and 6bp (in percentage points that is .03, .05, and .06):  

• 3bp:  
$$
{\frac{\partial P V(y=6.60\%)}{\partial y}}\approx{\frac{P V(6.60+.03)-P V(6.60-.03)}{2\times.03}}={\frac{99.5596-99.760575}{.06}}={\frac{-0.2046}{.06}}=-3.41
$$  

• 5bp:  
$$
{\frac{\partial P V(y=6.60\%)}{\partial y}}\approx{\frac{P V(6.60+.05)-P V(6.60-.05)}{2\times.05}}={\frac{99.5596-99.760575}{.10}}={\frac{-0.3410}{.10}}=-3.41
$$  

• 6bp:  
$$
{\frac{\partial P V(y=6.60\%)}{\partial y}}\approx{\frac{P V(6.60+.06)-P V(6.60-.06)}{2\times.06}}={\frac{99.5596-99.760575}{.12}}={\frac{-0.4092}{.12}}=-3.47
$$  
The change in bond price    $(P V(y+h)-P V(y-h))$   is di"erent for each, because we are bumping up and down by di"erent amounts. Those changes in bond price  on their own  will not be useful for the derivative because they measure changes for di"erent amounts of change in yield. But we can normalize and convert them all to the change in bond price per 1 percentage point change in yield if we divide by the amount of the bump   $(2\times h)$  . We see that the change in price from bumping up-and-down by 6bp is twice the change in prices using 3bp (to four decimals at least). We can use either one to give us our approximation to the derivate (change in price per 1 percentage point (100bp) change in yield). I tell you to use 5bp. Either 3 or 6 would also work, as long as we divide by the right    $2\times h$  . But using    $\pm$  50 bp is  not  a good idea because that is too big a change. We use a small change (small bump    $h$  ), and then normalize by the size of the bump to get the approximation per 1 percentage point change in yield.  

# 3.3 Duration  

# Contents  

# Duration: Length vs Sensitivity  

Three Concepts – I always start with BPV & DV01 • BPV & DV01 – dollar change per change in yield – (aka dollar duration)  
$$
B P V\;\&\;D V01=-{\frac{\partial P V}{\partial y}}\approx-{\frac{P V(y+h)-P V(y-h)}{2h}}
$$  

• Modiﬁed (Adjusted) Duration  $-\mathrm{~\textperthousand~}$   change per change in yield  
$$
M o d D u r=-\frac{1}{P V}\frac{\partial P V}{\partial y}=100\cdot\frac{B P V}{P V}
$$  

• Macaulay Duration – weighted avg time until get repayed in years (MacDur ⇑ maturity)  
$$
\begin{array}{l}{{M a c D u r=\sum t_{i}\cdot\displaystyle\frac{P V_{i}}{P V_{T}};\ t_{i}\,i s\,t i m e\,t o\,p a y m e n t\,i;\,\,\displaystyle\frac{P V_{i}}{P V_{T}}\,i s\,w e i g h t}}\\ {{M a c D u r=\left(1+\displaystyle\frac{y}{f r e q}\right)\cdot M o d D u r=100\cdot\displaystyle\frac{B P V}{P V}\cdot\left(1+\displaystyle\frac{y}{f r e q}\right)}}\end{array}
$$  

I like DV01 best – but Duration used more  

• I start with BPV / DV01, build to Duration  

• Most texts start with Duration – confusing because of   $\%$   sensitivity vs years  

Most textbooks and course start with duration but I ﬁnd that very confusing, since “duration” is used for both Macaulay Duration and Modiﬁed (or Adjusted) Duration. I ﬁnd it much easier to start with BPV / DV01 and then work towards Modiﬁed and Macaulay Duration. See the Wikipedia entry on “Bond Duration” ([ ? ]) which is pretty good. (One is not supposed to quote Wikipedia, but I contributed much of that entry so I am pretty happy with it.)  
Modiﬁed and Macauley Separate Concepts  

• Modiﬁed – sensitivity – % change in price • Macauley – time (as in “duration”) in years  

I teach DV01 then Modiﬁed then Macauley • Very easy to understand    $\begin{array}{r}{B P V\;\&\;D V01=-\frac{\partial P V}{\partial y}}\end{array}$  Why Macauley Duration at all?  

• History. • Quick-and-dirty guess for BPV  

• “Balance beam” shorter than maturity  

 !500  
Macaulay duration for 4yr  $6.5\%$   bond  $=$   3.65yrs  (annual coupon  $6.5\%$  , 4yrs, price 99.6582, yield  $6.6\%a b$  )

Think About YieldUse BPV/DV01 For default-risky bond like FIS, Yield decomposes into “UST” & “Spread”  $$
Y_{F I S}=Y_{U S T}+s p r e a d=Y_{U S T}+R i s k P r e m
$$  

Change decomposes into “UST” & “Spread”  
$$
\Delta Y_{F I S}=\Delta Y_{U S T}+\Delta Y_{s p r e a d}
$$  

FIS changes because discounting (UST) or risk premium (Spread) change How do we decompose actual price changes into “discounting” & “risk premium”?  

• Focus on Spread  

• Fill in Spread at period 2, and change in spread  

We want to decompose that \$0.646 loss into how much from UST & how much from FIS risk (Spread) Simple solution: Yield & Predicted P&L decomposes into “UST” & “Spread”  
$$

# There are a few important things to remember:  

BPV is for  $\S100$   notional, 100bp yld change; DV01 is actual notional, 1bp yld change:  
$$
D V01=A m o u n t*B P V/(100*100)
$$  

• One 100 is for the   $\S100$   notional (to get to   $\S1$   notional) and the other 100 is for the 100bp (to get to 1bp)  

ALWAYS put the negative sign for P&L:  
$$
P r e d\,P\&L=-\Delta Y\cdot D V01
$$  

• Remember that  
$$
D V01=-{\frac{\partial P V}{\partial y}}

# Can We Arrange Instrument(s) To Give This P&L?  

Can we actually trade bonds (portfolio) that give us this spread P&L?  

First Idea: Buy FIS (obviously) but then Sell UST  

• Selling UST will make money when  Y UST  ↔ (  $P\downarrow$  but short so make money)  

• Almost works, but amounts are not really right  

• We are making too much money on the UST – more than “predicted” –  We want actual P&L close to predicted \$121,830, but too much  

• But the reason is obvious – the UST BPV is too large –  Selling \$10mn of the UST would give DV01 of 8,380, not 7,860  

Solution is simple: sell less of the UST  

• BPV of UST is too high, so sell less • Sell   $7.86\ /\ 8.38=0.938$   or \$9.38mn • Now we have the right DV01: 9.38mn \* 8.38 / (100\*100) = 7,860 • Successfully created “Portfolio” (Long FIS, Short UST) giving spread P&L  

Powerful Idea:  

• Buying one instrument (FIS) that contains two risks (Discounting & Spread)  $\bullet$   Selling another instrument (UST) that strips out one risk (Discounting)

Buying a bond seems simple: pay   $\S100$   and you own the bond •    $P\uparrow$  you win,    $P\downarrow$  you lose But what if you don’t actually have \$100? •  Borrow  \$100, buy bond, so still    $P\uparrow$  you win,    $P\downarrow$  you lose But risk you won’t repay, so rate to borrow is high • Solution?  Collateralized  borrowing: you pledge the bond – give it away until you repay the loan • Still “own” the bond, so    $P\uparrow$  you win,    $P\downarrow$  you lose For US Treasury Bonds, called  Repo  (for “Repurchase”) • You Sell today, Buy back in future • Sell / Buy-Back or Repurchase (Repo) transaction  
# Now “Buying Bond” is Two Transactions: Buy & Repo  

BUY: Buy today at   $\mathrm{{P_{0}}}$   (give   $\S100$  ), plan sell later at high price (get \$?X?) REPO (2%): Sell today at   $\mathrm{{P_{0}}}$   (get   $\S100$  ), agree to buy back at   $\mathrm{P_{1}}(\mathrm{wire}\ \S102)$  Buy today and hope price goes way up Today: Buy & Repo all cancel  

• Get bond from purchase, give it for repo  

• Give   $\S100$   for purchase, get it from repo  

Tomorrow: Cash doesn’t cancel  

• Get bond back from repo, then sell in market – Bonds cancel  

• Get ?X? from selling, give away   $\S102$   in repo  

• Proﬁt = ?X? – 102  

• If ?X? is high, make money. If low, lose

• Need bond for sale, get it from repo  

• Cash cancels out  

Tomorrow: Cash doesn’t cancel  

• Give bond back for reverse, get by buying in market – Bonds cancel  

• Give ?X? to buy, get   $\S102$   in repo

# Shorting – Simple and Easy  

In summary, shorting is simple and easy Need way to “sell” something today, delay purchase until tomorrow or next week or next year  

• Repo or sell / buy-back (reverse repo or buy / sell-back):  

–  Sell today, agree to buy back in future –  Get bond cert i cates as collateral for lending money to someone  

• Forward & Futures contract: –  Agree today to sell in future

# HP  SOLVE  Menu – Discount Yield to Bond Yield  

Now, think about a TBill, where price is quoted using  Discount Yield  D:  
$$
P r i c e=100-D i s c Y l d\times\frac{A c t D a y s}{360}
$$  

and where the annualized yield is deﬁned from the PV equation:  
$$
P V={\frac{100}{\left(1+{Y}\!\!\left/f r e q\right)^{A D/\left(365\div f r e q\right)}}}
$$  

Putting    $P r i c e=P V$   we get the equation:  
$$
[^100]: -D Y\times{\frac{A D}{360}}={\frac{100}{\left(1+{Y}/{f r e q}\right)^{A D/\left(365\div f r e q\right)}}}
$$  

 !500  

You can then put this equation into the HP  SOLVER  menu as:  
$$
[^100]: -D Y\times\left(A D\div365\right)=100\div\left(\left(1+Y\div\left(f\times100\right)\right)\widehat{\mathbf{\xi}}\left(A D\div\left(365\div f\right)\right)\right)
$$  

and writing    $Y\div100\nobreakspace$   so that the calculator gives numbers like 4.83 (instead of .0483) Now you have your own    $S O L V E R$   menu with 4 items:    $D Y$   (quote or discount yield),    $A D$   (actual days),    $f$   (  $\mathrm{freeq}=1$   for annual bond, 2 for semi-annual bond), and    $Y$   (ab or sab)

# Bond PV O! Coupon Date & Sawtooth  

As move closer to next coupon, PV goes up: sawtooth pattern  

 !500  

• Underlying market value not changed – just “earning” coupon  

• Obscures underlying “value” – partly reﬂects earning past coupon defined as  

• If I buy after 0.2yrs, I pay “extra” because I get full coupon but hold for   $80\%$   not   $100\%$   of   period The Clean Price of the bond is defined as the PV or Dirty Price less the Accrued Interest:  

# (3.5)      Dirty Price, Clean Price, Accrued Interest  

Solution – split PV (“Dirty Price”) into two parts:  

• “Accrued Interest”: the fraction of the next coupon earned in past   Example 3.3 Price for a Eurobond between coupons   $-\ \S1.30=0.2^{*}\S6.5$  Continuing the example of the four year 6.5% bond, what would be the price (clean price) one month  after issue if the market yield were 6.6%?  Assume the bond were issued on 15 May 1997.  

• “Clean Price”: the price after adjusting: CleanP = DirtyP – AI In this case, 0.2 of coupon period (0.2yrs) has passed  
$\cdot\ \mathrm{cleanP}=\mathrm{DitheryP}-0.2^{*}6.5$  •   $99.64=100.94\AA-1.30$  

This “Accrued Interest” is what we’ve accrued because we’ve held the bond, and earned interest The “extra” I pay to seller because I get full coupon when paid  

But it’s not really part of the “market price” – what is quoted in the market

# Dirty Price, Clean Price, and Accrued Interest  

So far we have worked mostly with bonds with exact years; e.g. a bond which is exactly four years from maturity. What happens a few days later when it is no longer exactly four years from maturity? We then make a simple modi cation to arrive at equation (3.3) which discounts by the fraction of the period to the next coupon:  
$$
P V={\frac{c o u p}{(1+y)^{1}}}+{\frac{c o u p}{(1+y)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{100}{(1+y)^{4}}}
$$  

where  

PV  = Present Value (today’s value)  
$\textbf{y}=\mathrm{yield}$   or interest rate or discount rate x  = fraction of period to next coupon payment date  

The next coupon of   $\S6.50$   is a fraction x of a year away (say 292 days away which would be 0.8 of a year away). We discount by this fraction of a period rather than the whole period.  

The equation works perfectly ﬁne, but there is a slight problem which appears when we graph the PV as a function of maturity, shown in the ﬁgure above. For a four year bond with a   $6.5\%$  coupon and a   $6.5\%$   yield and exactly four years to go the PV is   $\S100$  . As we move into a coupon period and the maturity shortens, however, the PV rises. This is simply because we have earned or accrued part of the coupon, and the next coupon is moving closer. (With only a few days until the next coupon payment we have owned the bond for almost the whole coupon period and thus “earned” almost the whole coupon.) After the coupon is paid, of course, the PV falls back down to   $\S100$  . This saw-tooth pattern, while correct, obscures the fact that the market has not really changed and in some sense the market value of the bond has not changed; we have simply accrued part of the coupon by owning it for part of the coupon period.  
The bond markets adjust for this e"ect by the convention of calculating Accrued Interest (AI). This is deﬁned as  

AI = Next Coupon Payment \* (Fraction of Period from Last Coupon)  

The Clean Price of the bond is deﬁned as the PV or Dirty Price less the Accrued Interest:  

Clean Price = Dirty Price - AI  

The Clean Price for the four year   $6.5\%$   bond is shown in ﬁgure 3.3; it is a straight line at   $\S100$  . The TVM menu on the HP17B will handle only exact coupon periods and so will not work for a bond except when it is an exact number of years to maturity. The BOND menu is specially designed for use with bonds, and has yield / price calculations and accrued interest built in.  

NB: the better way to adjust would be to use PV(Next Coupon Payment)   $^*$   (Fraction of Period from Last Coupon)  

but that would be more complicated then we need. The bond calculator takes in the clean price, calculates the Accrued Interest, and then does the yield calculation on the actual PV (dirty price). We know that we need to compare yields and not prices, and so a slight “error” in the clean price is ﬁne – the calculator actually uses the dirty price or PV.  

We can see the slight error in the example above. The price at exactly four years is   $\S99.658$   or below par (\$100). As time marches on (with no change in value) we need to move up towards   $\S100$  . The “correct” CP shows this – it is   $\S99.73$   or slightly higher than   $\S99.658$  . The market CP is   $\S99.64\$  , slightly lower than   $\S99.658$  . But this is OK because the yield calculation (which is what we care about) uses the dirty price.  

# Accrued Interest Conventions  

There are various ways that we can calculate the “Fraction of the coupon period”. The main methods are:  

[^1]: Actual / Actual:
$$
A/A=\frac{A c t u a l\,D a y s\,S i n c e\,L a s t\,C o u p o n}{D a y s\,B e t w e e n\,C o u p o n\,D a t e s}
$$  

[^2]: 30/360:
$$
[^30]: /360={\frac{C o u n t\,E a c h\,M o n t h\,30,\,P l u s\,D a y s}{180\,o r\,360}}
$$  

This seems complicated but is acutally pretty simple. Count the number of months and multiply by 30 (30 days each month). Then take the extra days. Ignore the 31st. This means the number of 30/360 days from 15-feb to 25-jun are 130: four months 15-feb -  $>15$  -jun (120 days) plus 10 days 15-jun -  $>$   25-jun. You don’t have to worry that February has 28 days (except 29 on leap years) or that May has 31. The end-of-month is a little messy and there is a di"erence between 30/360 and 30E/360, but nobody ever remembers what the di"erence is.  

[^3]: Actual / 365 ﬁxed:
$$
A/A={\frac{A c t u a l\,D a y s\,S i n c e\,L a s t\,C o u p o n}{365}}*F r e q
$$  

which means you don’t have to count the number of days in the actual half-year. But this generates odd things at the end of long months – like negative accrued interest. British Gilts used to be A/365F but now A/A. Canadian bonds are A/365F, Japanese JGBs I think are A/365F.  
Actual /Actual makes perfect sense and you might think all bonds are done this way. But calculating days is rather messy (or at least was before calculators) and so 30/360 (and even A/365F) are still used. The “Bond” and “Time” menu on the HP calculator do date calculations. The “Bond” recognizes A/A and 30/360 (but not 30E/360 or A/365F). The “Time” menu recognizes A/A, 30/360, A/365F (but not 30E/360)  

# Accrued Interest Conventions – Compare Like-with-Like  

Price is price & cash is cash – the market price (DP) is what matters AI conventions tell us how to go:  

• Dirty Price    $\rightarrow$  yield (using PV formula: TVM or BOND menu)  

• Dirty Price    $\rightarrow$  Clean Price (subtracting AI)  

MUST compare like-with-like (A/A vs A/A & 30/360 vs 30/360)  

• Di"erent calendars say di"erent “fraction of year”    $\Rightarrow$  di"erent AI, di"erent Clean Price, di"erent yield  

• You pay 105.806 in both cases – same cash (Dirty Price) EXAMPLE : 6.5% bond, 342 days into year, on 28-feb-2019: Yield = 6.60%  $\bullet$  → DP=105.8086 (99.71823+6.0904)  

 !500  

•    $\rightarrow$  yld=6.584%  

 !500  

EXAMPLE : 6.5% bond, 342 days into coupon, on 28-feb-2019: Yield = 6.60% • Actual / Actual convention (0.9370 yrs), DP = 105.8086  

 !500  

• 30/360 convention (0.9306 yrs),   $\mathrm{CP}=105.8086-6.0486=99.7600$  

 !500  

Here the “di"erence” in yield is 1.6bp but in fact it is only due to di"erent conventions: 6.600%A/A

  $=6.584\%30/360$  .  

These di"erences are less than the di"erences in frequency basis (ab vs sab:   $6.60\%\mathrm{ab}=6.495\%\mathrm{sab}$  ,

[^10]: 5bp)

EXAMPLE:   $6.5\%$   bond, 73 days into coupon, on 4-jun-2018:   $\mathrm{Yid}\,=\,6.60\%$  •  Actual / Actual convention (0.2 yrs, AI=1.300), DP = 100.9403 (99.6403+1.3000)  

 !500  
•  30/360 convention (0.1972 yrs, AI=1.2819), CP = 100.9403 – 1.2819 = 99.6584  

 !500  

A/A and 30/360 prices and yields slightly di"erent (use Bloomberg “True Yield”)  

Comparing Across Frequency – Very Important For Semi (vs Annual), you get cash sooner (6mth instead of 1yr)  

• This truly makes a di"erence, semi more valuable  

Here, need to take yields and convert:   $6.60\%\mathrm{ab}\to6.495\%\mathrm{sab}$  
$$
[^1]: 066={\bigg(}1+{\frac{.06495}{2}}{\bigg)}^{2}\quad.06495=2*{\bigg(}{\sqrt{1.066}}-1{\bigg)}
$$

You pay more for semi-annual bond – you  should , since get coupon earlier.  

My “Practical Guide to Bonds and Swaps” (https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract  $\mathbf{\beta},=$  1554029) covers the various conventions. Many, however, have changed and are now A/A.

Sources for conventions:  

• http://treasury today.com/2001/11/day-count-conventions  

–  I’m not sure they are right in their deﬁnition of A/365(F) and A/365 (that they say is same as A/A). I think maybe there is some confusion between mm conventions (A/360 and A/365) and bond conventions (A/365(F) and A/A) –  They say that Eurobonds have switched from 30E/360 to A/A

# Yield: Always “Per Year”  

Very convenient to express price today vs tomorrow as yield:    $\sqrt[1]{1+y}$  • So far we haven’t said if “tomorrow” is next day or next year  

Almost  always  express yield “per year”:    $P V=F V/(1\!+\!y)^{n}$    with    $n=10$   yrs. Example: 4yr   $6.5\%$   coupon bond,   $\mathrm{P}=99.658$  :  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$  

TVM does this automatically, gives Yield (Interest) per yr (  $\%$  YR) • Make sure set right:   $<$  Blue  $>$     $<$  MAIN  $>$     $<$  FIN  $>$     $<$  TVM  $>$   <1 P/YR  $>$     $<$  END>  

 ![500  

Periodic CFs (Not 1 per year) Example: 4yr   $6.5\%$   coupon bond,   $\mathrm{P}=99.658\mathrm{~-~}6.5\%/\mathrm{yr}$  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$  

But what if pays every 6mths (like UST)? Get   $\S3.25$   every half-year. • Seems natural to use annual rate, for “number of years” (may be 1/2 year):  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1/2}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1.5}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$  

 !500  
# But No – Periodic CFs – Discount at Same Freq as Payment  

Example: 4yr semi-annual   $6.5\%$   coupon bond,   $\mathrm{P}=99.658\mathrm{~-~}3.25\%/6\mathrm{math}$  • Seems natural to use annual rate, discount “number of years”:  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1/2}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{1.5}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$  

But that’s far too simple. Instead, discount at same freq as payment:  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{1}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}}+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{3}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{3.25}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{8}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{8}}
$$  

Discount at a 6-mth (half-yr) rate,    $y_{s a b}/2$  

• 1st payment in 1 half-yr,    $[^1]\!/\!1\!+\!y s a b/2$  • 2nd payment in 2 half-yrs,    $1/(1+y s a b/2)^{2}$  

• etc up to 8th payment (4 yrs)  

Why    $y_{s a b}/2^{\circ}$  ? Report “annual” rate  

• Discount at half-yr rate    $y_{s a b}/2$  , but quote “annual”    $y_{s a b}=2\cdot y_{s a b}/2$

# Complication: Compounding!  

Among the most di!cult things you’ll learn – compounding is confusing You can quote the yield on various  bases :  

Annual:  (aka “ab”) annual rate compounded by years  

Semi-annual:  (aka “sab”) semi-annual rate compounded by half-years  
$$
\begin{array}{r c c}{{\S100\ i n\ 1y r:}}&{{}}&{{a n n u a l}}\\ {{\S100\ i n\ 1y r:}}&{{}}&{{92.59={\frac{100}{(1+.08)}}\ }}&{{92.59={\frac{100}{(1+.07846/2)^{2}}}}}\end{array}
$$  

CFs same (that’s what we buy   $\&$   sell).  

• “Yield” is convenient way to write PV   $<$  -  $>$   FV relations • Compounding and “basis” is code to tell you how to write PV relation  

AND, everyone likes to see an “annual” rate, so write  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{a b})^{Y r}}}&{{}P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{s a b}/2)^{2*Y r}}}\end{array}
$$  

This gives    $y_{s a b}\!=\,.07846\,=\,{\it2^{*}}.03923$  
# Some Tips on Compounding  

The most common “bases” or compounding frequencies are:  

[^1]: Annual or    $a b$   or annual bond:    $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{a b})^{Y r}}}\end{array}$  • European gov’t bonds, some corporates 2. Semi-annual or    $s a b$   or semi-annual bond:  $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{s a b}/2)^{2*Y r}}}\end{array}$  • US gov’t and corporate bonds 3. Monthly or    $m b$   or monthly bond:  $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{F V}{(1+y_{m b}/12)^{12*Y r}}}\end{array}$  • mortgage bonds NEVER, ever quote a rate without saying what basis   $(a b,\ s a b)$

• And yell at me when I do that (which I will) ALWAYS compare yields of same basis (ab vs ab, sab vs sab)  

# Converting Bases  

Remember, basis or compounding is just a way to quote the yield • CFs are what matter  

Always compare same basis • ALWAYS need to convert from ab to sab or vice-versa  

Start with fundamental discounting relation:  
$$
\left(1+y_{a b}\right)=\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}
$$  

! $$
y_{a b}=\left(1+y_{s a b}/2\right)^{2}-1\qquad y_{s a b}=2\cdot\left(\sqrt{1+y_{a b}}-1\right)
$$  

Compounding: In-Class Exercise 1 Annual, 4yrs, 6.5%/yr:   $<\!1$   P/YR  $>$  
 !500  

Semi-annual, 4yrs,   $3.25\%/\mathrm{yr}$  :   $^{<2}\mathrm{~P~/~YRe>~}$  
 !500  

But    $y_{a b}\ \&\ y_{s a b}$   fundamentally di!erent • Semi-annual bond more valuable: pay same (\$99.658) but get CFs sooner  

Need to convert between    $y_{a b}$   &    $y_{s a b}$  
$$
\begin{array}{r}{y_{a b}=(1+y_{s a b}/2)^{2}-1}\\ {~~~~~~~~~~~~~~y_{s a b}=2\cdot\left(\sqrt{1+y_{a b}}-1\right)}\end{array}
$$
 "  

Convert to    $y_{s a b}$   from    $y_{a b}=6.60\%$  :  

[^6]: 60%ab  ↓ lower when sab   $(6.49\%sab)$  )

Convert to    $y_{a b}$   from  $y_{s a b}=6.599\%$  :  

! " $$
y_{s a b}=2\cdot\left({\sqrt{1+.0660}}-1\right)=.0649
$$  
$$
y_{a b}=\left(1+.06599/2\right)^{2}-1=.06708
$$  
$6.599\%sab\to$  higher when ab   $(6.708\%ab)$  ) Now we see that, indeed, semi-annual bond is higher yield:  

• Annual bond:   $6.60\%\mathrm{ab}$   or   $6.49\%$  sab • Semi-annual:   $6.708\%$  b or   $6.599\%sab$  

Always  compare bonds on same basis

• ALWAYS compare like-with-like. 8% ab is  not    $8\%$   sab

# Left Hand Side Gives Real & Nominal Rates

Consumption (today vs tomorrow) depends on the relative price:  $\textstyle{\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}}\,{\frac{1}{1+y}}$  We know    $\scriptstyle{\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}}$    from Micro I. • Let’s write    $p_{2}=p_{1}\cdot(1+\pi)$   (inﬂation) Now relative price is:  $\textstyle{\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}}{\frac{1}{1+y}}={\frac{1+\pi}{1+y}}$  • Budget line is now:  $\begin{array}{r}{p_{1}c_{1}+p_{1}c_{2}\frac{1+\pi}{1+y}=m_{1}+m_{2}\frac{1}{1+y}}\end{array}$  • Deﬁne “real rate”  $\textstyle{\frac{1}{1+r}}={\frac{1+\pi}{1+y}}$  :    $\begin{array}{r}{p_{1}c_{1}+p_{1}c_{2}\frac{1}{1+r}=m_{1}+m_{2}\frac{1}{1+y}}\end{array}$  • For income (PV) look at  nominal  rate   $_{1+y}$  : PV is    $\begin{array}{r}{m_{1}+m_{2}\frac{1}{1+y}}\end{array}$  • For consumption,  real  rate    $\textstyle1+r={\frac{1+y}{1+\pi}}$    : Consumption is    $\begin{array}{r}{p_{1}c_{1}+p_{1}c_{2}\frac{1}{1+r}}\end{array}$  

[^1]: Unpacking the budget constraint: nominal & real rates

• This budget constraint tells us everything we need to know about discounting, PV, FV, nominal rates, real rates. In fact everything we need to know about TVM (for certain – known – CFs). • But we need to unpack this budget constraint, and think about it a little carefully. –  Once we do that we will then use the ideas of discounting, PV, FV, etc. to examine every aspect of modern ﬁnance. –  We will talk about bonds and discounting over multiple periods. About compounding and variable periods (rates per month, half-year, year). About nominal rates vs real rates. But the ideas all come back to this simple picture and simple budget line. (Have I ever said  
how wonderful budget lines are? I used to think they were really boring, but I’ve come to appreciate that a good part of economics is just thinking carefully about budget lines.)  

• Nominal Rates: By “Nominal” we mean “money”. We’ve been looking at money income or nominal income, the dollar PV:    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . For this we have been using the rate    $y$   which we call the  nominal  interest rate, the rate that applies to dollars.  

–  The nominal rate is what you see quoted in the papers. As of 22-feb-18, the nominal rate on 10-year UST is   $2.92\%$  . Roughly means that   $\S100$   today grows to   $\S102.92\$   in one year, or  $100=102.92\big/1+.0292$  . (We will go through exactly what this means shortly – semi annuallycompounded bond rate for (approximately) 10-year bond – 2.75% of 15-feb-18, QD=22-feb, SD=23-feb, P=98-18+,   $\mathrm{y}{=}2.9152\%$  –  Much of the course we will only be looking at nominal income and nominal rates  

• But let’s look at the LHS, look at consumption and the relative price of consumption today vs tomorrow. Period-2 has the term   $1/(1\!+\!y)$  , just like the money income side. But the actual (relative) price of period-2 consumption is  
$$
{\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}}{\frac{1}{\left(1+y\right)}}
$$  

The extra  $\frac{p2}{p1}$    comes in because we are talking about  real  (as opposed to nominal) quantities – the real number of loaves of bread and bottles of wine. For the usual picture, where we are talking about all goods  today  we have just    $\textstyle{\frac{p2}{p1}}$    but now we have the extra term   $1/(1\!+\!y)$   which tells us how we transform between today and tomorrow.  

–  We will almost always want to think about  inﬂation    $\pi$   which is the change in prices from today to tomorrow:    $p_{2}=p_{1}\cdot(1+\pi)$  –  The expression now becomes  ${\frac{1+\pi}{1+y}}={\frac{1}{1+r}}$  and this gives us the  real interest rate :    $(1+r)=(1+y)/(1+\pi)$  –  When we are talking about consumption and real goods we always need to think about the real rate    $r$   rather than the nominal rate    $y$  .  

# Real, Nominal, Expected Inﬂation  

Di"erence between these is the (expected) inﬂation rate  
$$
[^1]: +y=(1+r)\cdot(1+\pi)
$$  
$$
y\approx r+\pi
$$  
# Real, Nominal, Inﬂation Today  

From the market 24 March 2023, UST & TIPS:  

UST    $y=3.358\%$   (0.03358)  

TIPS  $r=1.132\%$  (0.01132)  
$$
y\approx r+\pi
$$  
$$
[^3]: 36\%\approx1.13\%+\pi
$$  

Expected inﬂation    $\pi{=}2.23\%$  

• Market expects moderate inﬂation   $({}^{\sim}2.23\%)$  ) over next ten years!  

What does those negative real rates (2020-2022) mean?  

• Investors have low price on consumption today:  p  $\begin{array}{r}{p_{1}c_{1}+p_{1}c_{2}\frac{1}{1+r}\,=\,m_{1}+m_{2}\frac{1}{1+y}}\end{array}$    means    $r\downarrow$  as if p tomorrow  ≃ &  p today  ↘  

• During pandemic, severe concerns about opportunities and consumption tomorrow  

# Inﬂation, CFs, and Discounting  

We mostly look at nominal CFs in this course  

In Corporate Finance (project ﬁnance), CBA often consider real CFs Incredibly important – Two ways to treat inﬂation, for CFs  $\&$   Discounting  

[^1]: Real CFs (today’s dollars), real discount rate 2. Inﬂation-adjusted CFs (nominal), nominal discount rate

Real vs nominal cash CFs  

[^1]: Real: forecast sales, costs, beneﬁts, etc. in today’s dollars (no inﬂation) 2. Nominal: CFs grow:  CF nominal  $C F\,n o m i n a l_{t}=C F\,r e a l_{t}\cdot(1+\pi)^{t}$

Real vs. nominal rates  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{{1+n o m i n a l=\left(1+r e a l\right)\cdot\left(1+e x p\,i n f l\right)}}\\ {{\left(1+y\right)=\left(1+r\right)\cdot\left(1+\pi\right)}}\end{array}
$$  

I somewhat prefer (1): real CFs and real rate • Don’t have to think as hard about inﬂation – Good and bad!  

# Inﬂation – Keep “Real with Real”, “Nominal with Nominal”  

 !500  

• Nominal rate:   $8\%$  • Expected inﬂation:   $5\%$  
$(1+y)=(1+r)\cdot(1+\pi)\Rightarrow(1.08)=(1.02857)\cdot$  (1 . 05) Real:    $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{100}{1.02857}+\frac{100}{(1.02857)^{2}}=191.744}\end{array}$  

Nominal:  $\textstyle P V={\frac{105}{1.08}}+{\frac{110.25}{(1.08)^{2}}}=191.744$  Except – when some CFs grow, others do not – like depreciation • Must use nominal CFs, discount at nominal rates • Real may be useful for “quick-and-dirty”

Example of inﬂation e!ect A few notes on this: 1. I am asking what happens when expected inﬂation up by 3 percentage points, from   $2.18\%$   to   $5.18\%$  . 2. I  assume  that real rates don’t change. It could be that real rates go down, and we will see that real rates can go negative. 3. But generally when inﬂation goes up, so do nominal rates. And nominal bonds lose big

# Thinking About Yield Changes:    $y$   ↔≃ Budget Line Twists  

First consider simple case: you only have Future CF or Present CF:  
$$
R e m e m b e r\,P V={\frac{F V}{(1+y)}}
$$  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{B u d g e t\;L i n e\;R H S:}&{{}\;P V:\;m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)}\\ {F V:\;(1+y)\cdot m_{1}+m_{2}}\end{array}
$$  

Growth:  Only    $m_{1}$  , Present CF (PV ﬁxed),  $y\uparrow$   CF tomorrow    $\uparrow$  and you are richer:  budget line  ↓

# 1 How to Think About Yield: Unpacking the Budget Line  

Remember: The Budget Line: PV, FV, Discounting  
$$
p_{1}c_{1}=m_{1}-s;\ p_{2}c_{2}=m_{2}+(1+y)s
$$  
$$
p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}/(1+y)=m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)
$$  
$$
p_{1}c_{1}\cdot(1+y)+p_{2}c_{2}=m_{1}\cdot(1+y)+m_{2}
$$  

 !500  

# Remember: Right Hand Side Gives PV, FV & Discounting  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{{R H S:}}&{{P V:\:m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)}}\\ {{}}&{{F V:\:(1+y)\cdot m_{1}+m_{2}}}\end{array}
$$  

The RHS gives us the correct measure of  income  

•  Today’s  money we call Present Value or PV •  Tomorrow’s  money we call Future Value or FV  
$\mathbf{1}{+}\mathbf{\boldsymbol{y}}$   price between today   $\&$   tomorrow  

I. Unpacking the budget constraint: PV, FV, nominal & real rates  

• This budget constraint tells us everything we need to know about discounting, PV, FV, nominal rates, real rates. In fact everything we need to know about TVM (for certain – known – CFs). • But we need to unpack this budget constraint, and think about it a little carefully.  
–  Once we do that we will then use the ideas of discounting, PV, FV, etc. to examine every aspect of modern ﬁnance. –  We will talk about bonds and discounting over multiple periods. About compounding and variable periods (rates per month, half-year, year). About nominal rates vs real rates. But the ideas all come back to this simple picture and simple budget line. (Have I ever said how wonderful budget lines are? I used to think they were really boring, but I’ve come to appreciate that a good part of economics is just thinking carefully about budget lines.)  

•  PV : So let’s start by looking at the RHS or the budget constraint:    $p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}/(1+$   $y)\,=\,m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . The RHS says that the income for the budget line is the sum  $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . We call this the Present Value, and it is the correct measure of income when we look at any set of CFs across time – we always need to discount future amounts (future CFs) back to today by   $1/(1\!+\!y)$  .  

–  This is the most important, maybe the only important thing, you will learn in this course: how to calculate and think about PVs. –  PVs matter and only PVs matter. Nothing else you learn in ﬁnance is as important as this. In fact, there really is not much else in ﬁnance except PV –  Three-quarters of this course is simply calculating    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . This becomes very complicated: What are the CFs? When are the CFs? What is the rate    $y$  ? How do we quote the discount rate    $y$   and how do we calculate the discounting   $1/(1\!+\!y)$  ? How do we get an appropriate rate? –  But it all comes down to PV:    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  .  

•  FV : the expression    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$   expresses income in terms of period-1 money. But we could also write the budget line in terms of period-2 money:  
$$
p_{1}c_{1}\cdot(1+y)+p_{2}c_{2}=m_{1}\cdot(1+y)+m_{2}
$$  

Now the RHS is the FV:    $m_{1}\cdot(1+y)+m_{2}$  . FV is in terms of tomorrow’s money (PV is today’s money). For the budget line it is totally irrelevant, since it increases the income but also the prices on the LHS – the budget line does not change. (  $p_{1}\;\rightarrow\;p_{1}\cdot(1\;+\;$   $y)\,\&\,p_{2}/(1+y)\to p_{2}$  )  

II. The term (1+y) or    $\sqrt[1]{1\!+\!y}$   is the price between today and tomorrow.  

• For every   $\S1$   today, we get 1+y next period. For one year, y will be something like 0.04 or   $4\%$  . • The term    $\sqrt[1]{1+y}$   is called the  discount factor : it tells us how much   $\S1$   next period is worth today (it will be less than   $\S1$  , discounted) • y is called the interest rate, discount rate, yield, yield-to-maturity, IRR (internal rate or return), expected return. These all mean slightly di"erent things.  
# Thinking About Yield Changes:    $y\uparrow\Rightarrow\mathbf{Bondget}$   Line Twists  

First consider simple case: you only have Future CF or Present CF:  
$$
R e m e m b e r\,P V={\frac{F V}{(1+y)}}
$$  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{B u d g e t\;L i n e\,R H S:}&{{}\;P V:\;m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)}\\ {F V:\;(1+y)\cdot m_{1}+m_{2}}\end{array}
$$  

Growth:  Only    $m_{1}$  , Present CF (PV ﬁxed),  $y\uparrow$   CF tomorrow  $\uparrow$  and you are richer:  budget line  →  

• PV=100, y=4%,    $F V=100\cdot{\big(}1+.04{\big)}=104$  

• FV=100, y=5%,    $P V=100\cdot(1+.05)=105-R i c h e r$  

Inﬂation:  Only    $m_{2}$  , Future CF (FV ﬁxed),  $y\uparrow$  as if    $P V$   of CF tomorrow  $\downarrow$  and you are poorer:  budget line  ↑ •   $\mathrm{scriptstyleFV=100}$  , y=4%,  $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{100}{\left(1+.04\right)}=96.15}\end{array}$  

•   $\mathrm{scriptstyleFV=100}$  , y=5%,  $\begin{array}{r}{P V=\frac{100}{(1+.05)}=95.24-\,P o o r e r}\end{array}$

$$
P V={\frac{F V}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}
$$  

PV  = Present Value (today’s value)  

FV  = Future Value (future cash ﬂow)  

N  = number of periods (years) of discounting  

For example:    $\begin{array}{r}{85.73=\frac{100}{(1+.08)^{2}}}\end{array}$  

• But things can get complicated:  

• For example, what about “periods”    $N=2$  ? Is that 2 years, or two half-years (1 year)?  

Need to be careful when we use PV formula  

# Multiple CFs: Just Apply PV Many Times  

PV is today’s cash value, so just add the various PVs • Say   $\S6.50$   in year 1, 2, 3, 4, and also   $\S{100}$   in year 4. One PV each CF:  
$$
P V={\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}}+{\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}}+{\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}}+{\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}}+{\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}}
$$  

A few things about this:  

•  We  always  want to work with a “CF diagram”  

• CF diagram with these 5:    $P V$  ,    $F V$   (ﬁnal payment)    $I\%Y R\ (y)$  , periodic    $P M T$  ,    $N$   : incredibly common and useful  

• This is a “bond”: ﬁxed coupon per year,   $\S100$   at the end  

 !500  
# Taking Apart and Solving PV Formula  

For single future CF, things are easy:  
$$
P V={\frac{F V}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}
$$  

• Four variables   $(P V,\,F V,\,y,\,N)$  : easily solve for one given the others Solving more tricky with bond-type multiple CFs  
$$
P V={\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}+{\frac{F V}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}
$$  

• Five variables   $(P V,\,F V,\,P M T,\,y,\,N)$  

• Can get    $P V$   when given other four. How to get    when given    $P$  V ,  PMT , ...?  $y$

# Using TVM for 4 yr Bond  

Four year ﬁxed-coupon bond:  

• PV=99.658, \$6.50 in year 1, 2, 3, 4, and also   $\S100$   in year 4, FV=100  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$  

Five variables – put in 4, ask for 5th  

I. N=4: number of periods II. I%YR=6.6: interest rate (per year)  

III. PV=-99.658: as negative  

IV. PMT=6.5: periodic payment (per period)  

V. FV=100

Yield as “value” of bond or CFs: Three ideas:  

I.    $P V\downarrow\Rightarrow$  better value (“cheaper”):    $P V\downarrow Y\uparrow$  II.  Coup  ↓↔ better value (“more CF”):  Coup  ↓ Y  ↓  

III. Yield is a way to think about “value”: High    $Y$   means high  Value  (low Price) First two are simple and obvious – formula & CF diagram • Third is deep and meaningful – allows us to use yield for all kinds of comparisons  

 !500  

# TVM – Low Price & High Yield – In-Class Exercise 1  

Starting with bond from above, what happens when price (PV) goes down? Start with 4 year bond (from above)  

 !500  

 !500  

•  Remember that    $\textstyle P V={\frac{F V}{1+y}}$    , so low price means high yield  

•  Yield e!ectively measures the “price” of the bond, taking into account both the up-front price and the coupon you earn.  

•  Simple in this case because same bond, just lower price – yield up  
# TVM – High Coupon and High Yield – Exercise 2  

Same bond to start, but now increase the coupon (keeping PV the same) Continue with 4 year   $6.5\%$   coupon bond from above  

 !500  

What happens with a higher coupon? (  $7\%$   up from   $6.5\%$  ) Higher coupon means higher yield (more future CF)  

 !500  

•  Also simple: same price, coupon higher  $\rightarrow$  more each year •  Here up-front is the same, but the  $7\%$   coupon bond is truly “cheaper” because the coupon is higher. •  Yield trades-o! the up-front price versus the future coupon you earn.  

# PV & CF Change: High Yield  ↔ High Value / Low Price  

Complicated when  both  PV & CF change  

• Yield balances PV & CF.  

• We can work with either prices (PV & CF) or yield – PV eqtn converts between two two:  
$$
P V={\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}}+{\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}}
$$  

TVM or BOND converts prices/CFs (PV&PMT)  ↘ Yield:  

 !500  

 !500  
$\scriptstyle{\mathsf{P V}}=99.658$  
# In-Class Exercise 3: Yield Compares Di!erent Bonds  

Yield measures trade-o" between low price today (PV) vs CFs in the futures • Comparable across bonds with di"erent coupon, price, maturity Let’s compare 3 bonds (in-class exercise using TVM) I. 4yr   $6.5\%$   coupon bond,   $\mathrm{P}=99.658$  ,    $y i e l d\,=\,6.60\%$  

II. 4yr   $4\%$   coupon bond, P = 91.113 – does low price o"set low coupon? yield = 6.60%  – low price  does  o"set low coupon  

III. 6yr 7% coupon bond,   $\mathrm{P}=101.930$  ,  yield = 6.60%  

Yield trades o" price today vs size of coupon   $\&$   maturity All these bonds are more-or-less same “value” (yield 6.60%)  

 !500  

Here we can compare three di"erent bonds – same in value   $\&$   how much we earn  

• Yield means discounting: converting between present and future cash –  Flat yield-to-maturity not perfect – Generally “term structure” upward or downward sloping –  Example: UST 2yr 2.88%, 10yr 3.23% (upward) –  Later we look at “term structure of interest rates” and “yield curve” –  But so much better than price alone – balances price vs coupon vs maturity  

Yield is better way to think of “market price” than dollar price  

• Just remember: P  ↓ & Y  $\downarrow$  

What if there were a 4th bond?  

IV.  4yr 5% bond,   $\mathrm{{P}=92.00}$  . What is the yield? Could this price occur in reality?  

•  Let’s use  TVM to ask “what is yield?”Yield for this bond is 7.38% – Would never occur in real markets  

 !500  
Yield-to-maturity isn’t perfect, because generally there will be a “term-structure” meaning that CFs with di"erent maturities are discounted at slightly di"erent  

• UST yields quoted in slide: 5-oct-2018 quotes, 2yr 2.75s of 30-sep-20, 10yr 2.875s of 15-aug-28 But YTM is pretty good, and for now we will use YTM, ignoring any issues about term structure  

• Later in the course we will introduce “term structure of interest rates” or “yield curve”  

# 3.3 Where Do We Get Yield?  

[^3]: 3.1 Bonds – Markets give us Yield (Discount Rate, Expected Return)

# Contents  

# For Bonds – Markets Give Us Yield (Discount Rate)  

For bonds (say our 4 yr   $6.5\%$   coupon) move back-and-forth: Price  $\leftrightarrow$  Yield  

• PV=99.658, PMT=\$6.50 in year 1, 2, 3, 4, FV=\$100  ≃↑ Yield=6.60%  
$$
P V={\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}+{\frac{F V}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}
$$  

For bond CF diagram (down today, up tomorrow) unique solution PV  $\leftrightarrow$  Yield  

•  Yield often better, adjusts for low price, high coupon, long maturity  

Solving for yield gives economic discount rate  
$$
p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}/(1+y)=m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)
$$  

• Yield is “Price” of income today vs tomorrow • Yield is “Discount Rate” – fundamental to economic   $\&$   ﬁnancial analysis

We get yields from market prices:  P  $P\rightarrow Y$   ↑

A number of questions:  

• What are UST vs TIPS?  

• What are “coupon”, “maturity”, “price”, “yield”?  

• What about that negative yield on German Bunds?  

Three things we will discuss  

I. What are bonds & bond CFs? Discuss brieﬂy, return later in course  

II. How we apply PV ideas to bonds - same ideas, same formulae as now  

III. Real vs nominal CFs & discount rates  

# 10yr UST CFs  

“Coupon” etc. all have to do with deﬁning CFs – look at CF diagram  

• Coupon = 1.50% means:   ${^\circ\S1.50}\ /\ 2$   every six months” –  For now we will pretend it is   $\S1.50$   every year – close enough for now  

• Maturity = 15-aug-26 means: “ﬁnal payment (\$100) on 15-aug-26; coupons every 15-aug & 15-feb” –  For now pretend exactly 10yrs – close enough for now  

CF diagram just like any bond – ﬁts with TVM  

• Project valuation: NPV  $\leftarrow$  CF + RADR (risk-adjusted discount rate)  

• Bond: Market price + CF  ↑ yield

# Bonds: Market Gives us Yield (Discount Rate)  

For bonds, PV formula is:  $P V={\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}}+{\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}}$  • Bond contract tells us  PMT ,  N ,  FV  =100 • Market gives us PV We can back out the yield (discount rate) Market gives this to us, for free

[^3]: 3.2 Equities & Projects: Di"cult – Estimate Yield from Similar Risk

# Contents  

# Equities & Projects: Yield & TVM  ↑ PV  

Bonds have promised CFs:  

• For bonds: Market Value & CF    $\rightarrow$  yield  

• Given CF & PV, back out yield (market  discount rate ,  required rate of return )  

For projects, trying to ﬁgure out PV & NPV – need Yield  

• We often don’t have market prices, say for starting a new business  

• Have estimates of CFs, need yield to calculate PV  

• Given CF & risk-adjusted yield, calculate PV & NPV  

But where does Yield (Discount Rate, Required Rate) come from?  

• If CFs were promised and certain, then discount using UST rate  

• But always risky  

• Look for other assets with similar risk, get market price, back out risk-adjusted yield  

But we don’t yet know what “risk” is  
# 4 Yield / Discount Rate, Holding Period Return, IRR  

[^4]: 1 Yield / Discount Rate (Expected Return, Required Return, Interest Rate)

# Contents  

Market Yield (For a Bond)  Is  the Discount Rate Yield ,  Discount Rate ,  Expected Return, Required Return, Interest Rate :  

• Multiple names for the same thing  

• Price for translating CFs between tomorrow and today  

• More-or-less di"erent names for same concept  

For bonds, markets give us the Yield / Discount Rate  

• Convert price to yield, and that is (pretty-much) the correct market discount rate  

For equities, for projects (corporate projects, Cost Beneﬁt Analysis)  

• Back-out discount rate from other methods  

• Portfolio theory and CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) most fundamental tools  

# 4.2 Holding Period Return  

# Contents  

Yield (Looking Forward) vs Return (Looking Backward) Yield ,  Discount Rate ,  Interest Rate : Price for translating today to tomorrow  

• Price set today  

• Looks from today to the future:  $\sqrt[1]{1+y}$   is  today ’s price of   $\S1$   in the future (something like  $\S0.9615=\mathrm{1/1+.04}$  )  

Yield is what you are promised, what you expect to get Now turn around, look  backwards  at what you actually earned –  Return Two reasons why Yield and Return may di"er  

• Yield is  promise  but promise may get broken. Or maybe a  range  of possibilities –  We don’t know how to do this yet – uncertain CFs. We come to this later  

• Prices change, and we often have CFs spread over time  
# Bond as Package of CFs Over Time  

Single CF: yield = return when hold to maturity • Example: Buy 1yr T-bill   $@$   $\S96.15=100\big/1\!+\!.04$  • Yield (looking forward):    $1+.04=100\%.15$  • Return (looking backward):    $1+.04=100\%.15$  Bonds usually package of multiple CFs: 4yr,   $\S6.5$   each year for 4, then   $\S100$  .  

• Price today (\$99.658) embeds separate price for each CF  $99.658=\frac{6.5}{\left(1+z_{1}\right)}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+z_{2}\right)^{2}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+z_{3}\right)^{3}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+z_{4}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+z_{4}\right)^{4}}$  
$\bullet$     $z$   for  zero rate  instead of yield  

If we hold for only 3yrs, then still have    $z4$   in future, it may change  

• If we re-sell at yr 3, then  return  may be di"erent than  promised yield  
# Yield is Future, Return is Past  

Yield is what you would earn, looking to the future:  Yield is Hope Return is what you did earn, holding over the past:  Return is Experience Example: 4yr   $6.5\%$   coupon bond,  $\mathrm{P}=99.658$  , all zeros   $\mathrm{same=ydf=}6.60\%$  
$$
[^99]: 658=\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{2}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{3}}+\frac{6.5}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}+\frac{100}{\left(1+y_{a b}\right)^{4}}
$$

Yield: what you  would  earn, holding until end:   $6.60\%$  

Standard TVM calculation for yield  

 !500  

Yield: would price be at year 3?  

• If Yld for yr 4 is   $6.60\%$  , price at yr   $3=\S99.91$  

How to calculate price at yr 3? Easy – TVM with N=1, yld=6.60%  

 !500  

But what if sell at yr 3, Sell at   $\S$  98?  

• Yld for yr 4 now 8.67%, di"erent than original   $6.60\%$  

Again, use TVM to ask for yield, if PV=–98  

 !500  

Hold to year 3, sell for \$98, earn what?  

• What you earn by holding for 3yr and selling at \$98?  

• Hold to year 3, sell for \$98, earn   $6.00\%$   for yrs 1-3  

Again, TVM but now FV = 98 (sell at 98 at yr 3)return=6.00%: What you earn by holding for 3yr and selling at   $\S98$  

 !500  
The idea of  Promised Yield  (or yield, or interest rate, or discount rate) versus  Holding Period Return is always di!cult to understand and to explain.  

The basic idea is:  

•  Promised Yield  looks forward, what you are promised •  Holding Period Return  looks backward, what you actually earned  

The question is, “Why are they ever di"erent” and there are two reasons:  

I. Promises get broken: you aren’t paid what was promised. Or, more generally, you may not be promised one speciﬁc value – there may be a range of possible future CFs and when one of them happens, that is what you earned.  

• But we don’t know how to deal with broken promises or uncertain CFs (a range of values). We get to that in a couple weeks.  

II. For now the more important reason is that most bonds, most assets we look at, are a package of CFs spread over time with multiple yields (prices for future CFs). Prices change over time, and if we sell part-way, our Holding Period Return (what we have earned) reﬂects the change in prices.  

• For the simple analysis with the budget line we pretended there was just today vs tomorrow (c1 vs c2) and only one yield or discount factor (y or 1+y). • In real life we deal with CFs spread over time: c1, c2, c3, ... . We have one yield or discount factor for each: y1, y2, y3, ... .  

The slide above works through an example (4-yr bond) where we sell part-way through (after 3 years).  

• At the start all the inter temporal prices (the discount rates or yields or zero rates) are the same,   $6.60\%$  . • But at y3 the price for yr 4 has changed a lot, to 8.67% (you sell 1yr bond at \$98). • The yield has gone up so the price has gone down. If the yield had stayed at   $6.60\%$   you would be able to sell at   $\S99.91\$  . Instead you sell at   $\mathsection$  98. You lose. • The result is that over the ﬁrst 3 yrs you earn only 6.00%, not the   $6.60\%$   you were promised.  

The reason: you didn’t hold all the way, you sold at year 3, and you sold for a low price.  
# 4.3 IRR (Internal Rate of Return)  

# Contents  

# Yield & IRR Look Similar – Fundamentally Di!erent Ideas Bond Yield  (Yield-to-Maturity) translates   $\mathsection$   Price into %y Price:  
$$
P r i c e=\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)}+\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}+\frac{F V}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}
$$  

• Bonds trade in markets, Price set by Market: Bond Price    $\longleftrightarrow$  Market Discount Rate (Yield)  

• Two ways of expressing the market price –   $\S$   or   $\%$  yld  

Internal Rate of Return  (IRR) equation  looks  similar:  
$$
C F_{0}={\frac{C F_{1}}{\left(1+I R R\right)}}+{\frac{C F_{2}}{\left(1+I R R\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{C F_{N}}{\left(1+I R R\right)^{N}}}
$$  

But fundamentally di"erent  

IRR generally used for non-traded projects , a tool for asking “is project valuable?”  

•  High  IRR    $\rightarrow$  thinking “high return, valuable, worth doing”  

• Fundamental issue:    $C F_{0}$   is  not  the price or PV set by markets, simply the initial investment  

• Sometimes IRR gives us a reasonable answer, sometimes it is misleading  

IRR Can Be Misleading – Simple Project Example Today (yr=0) Tomorrow (yr=1) Next yr (yr=2) Build Factory Produce product, Tear down factory, earn proﬁts dispose of waste  $\begin{array}{r l r l r}{\mathrm{CF=Const}=-\S100}&{}&{\mathrm{CF=Profit}=}&{}&{\mathrm{CF=Const}=-\S136}\\ &{}&{+\S235}\end{array}$  

IRR formula:  
$$
C F_{0}={\frac{C F_{1}}{\left(1+I R R\right)}}+{\frac{C F_{2}}{\left(1+I R R\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{C F_{N}}{\left(1+I R R\right)^{N}}}
$$  
$$
[^100]: =\frac{235}{(1+I R R)}+\frac{-136}{(1+I R R)^{2}}
$$  

So let’s solve this, with our handy HP calculator and CF menu  

•  <Blue> Main  / FIN / CFLO /    $<$  Blue> Clear Data • –100 INPUT / 235 INPUT / –136 INPUT /  CALC  

• 10 i%  [starting guess]  / IRR%  [calculation]  ↔ 3.14%  

• 20 i%  [starting guess]  / IRR%  [calculation]  ↔ 31.86%  

Big problem – two solutions: 3.14% and   $31.86\%$  

• Which is right?  Both  

Fundamental problem: IRR gives multiple solutions  

• Is this project really low return   $(3.14\%$  ) or really high   $(31.86\%)$  )?  
# IRR is Asking Wrong Question  

IRR asks wrong question.  

Instead of IRR, use  market discount rate  (yields) to calculate    $N P V$   (adding up CF today and PV of future CFs)  

• Ask “What is market value   $(N P V)$   if  discount rate (yield) were    $y'$  :  $N P V=C F_{0}+{\frac{C F_{1}}{\left(1+y\right)}}+{\frac{C F_{2}}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{C F_{N}}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}$   $N P V=-100+{\frac{235}{\left(1+y\right)}}+{\frac{-136}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}$  

For our example: If    $y=10\%$  ,    $N P V=\S1.24$  . If    $y=2\%$  ,   $N P V=-\S0.33$  

Calculating market discount rates is really hard – ﬁrm  cost of capital  in corporate ﬁnance courses  

# Yield & IRR Look Similar – Why Use Yield But Not IRR?  

Two important facts about bonds:  

I. Bond CFs are all negative today (pay a price) and positive tomorrow (earn coupons and principal)  

• When future CFs are all the same sign, there is a single solution for yield (and IRR)  

II. Even more important, markets give us the price  

• Using  market prices  to uncover  market discount rate  (yield)  

Bond Yield (Yield-to-Maturity):  
$$
P V={\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)}}+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+{\frac{P M T}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}+{\frac{F V}{\left(1+y\right)^{N}}}
$$  

• Bond Price    $\longleftrightarrow$  Yield – single solution, only one yield for each price  

Bonds trade in Financial Markets, Price set by Market  

•  ↔ Yield is Market Discount Rate (Expected Return, Required Return)

Six Parts of the Financial System I. Money II.  Financial Instruments III.  Financial Markets IV.  Financial Institutions V. Regulatory Agencies VI. Central Banks This course focuses on 2, 3, 4 • Cecchetti & Schoen holt z has a nice overview – their Ch 3 (Ch1 in ebook)  

# Financial Instruments / Securities  

• A ﬁnancial instrument is the legal obligation (contract) to transfer something of value at some future date –  Usually transfers of money (versus, say, labor contract which is about labor) • Very general deﬁnition • Easier to see in examples: –  Bond: government or corporation promises to pay ﬁxed cash ﬂows at speciﬁc dates –  Stock or equity: corporation promises to pay portion of proﬁts (if there are any) Can become very complex – but underlying ideas simple: • Transfer cash today vs tomorrow (discounting)  
# Uses of Financial Instruments  

I. Means of Payment • For purchase of goods and services • Bank deposit (checking account) is a ﬁnancial instrument. Use to pay for all kinds of things. • Electronic funds transfers, use bonds or stocks to pay II. Store of value • Transfer value from today into the future III. Transfer of risk – between people or over time • Options, swaps, futures. Insurance contracts  

# Examples: Financial Instruments We Care About  

see Cecchetti p 53 I. Government bond. Corporate bond.  

II. Equity  

III. Foreign Exchange  

IV. Bank demand deposits (checking account) – loan to a bank  

• Keep Money a little separate –  Another course (History of Financial Crises)  

# Bond – Government or Corporate  

• Promises to pay ﬁxed CFs, at ﬁxed dates –  Example: \$6.50 every year for 4yrs, then \$100 –  Doesn’t  have  to be ﬁxed CFs (could ﬂoat up and down) but most bonds  

• Store of Value: Transforms current value into future value  

• Need to use discounting and PV  

• May involve risk  

• Corporation promises to pay back, but may break promise  

 !500  
# Good Example of “Financial Instrument”  

• Promise to pay you something of value –  Usually pays “money” (dollars) – but not always – gold clause in bonds prior to 1933  

• You need to give up something today to get this  

• Can sometimes use as payment –  Government bonds OK –  Corporate bonds poor –  Why? Need to study company to decide how valuable, whether company will pay in future –  Not good as “money” – whatever that is  

 !500  

# Equity  

• Called “Equity” or “Stock”  

• Promise of company (corporation) to pay proﬁts as dividends  

• As with bond, transforms current value into future value –  But unlike bond, no promises on how much – just paying out proﬁts  

# Foreign Exchange (FX)  

• Buying and selling di!erent currencies  

• Think of buying US dollars currency, selling British pounds –  Buy US \$, Sell UK £ –  Sell US \$, Buy Chinese ¥ (Yuan)

 • As I have described, a ﬁnancial transaction

 • Actually, most FX transactions are instruments –  Agree to transfer currency in future – maybe 2 days, often 1 month or 6 months in the future (FX forward)  
 !500  

# 2.2 Markets  

# Contents  

# Market as “Information Processing Engine”  

• Fundamental idea, throughout economics: –  When prices and markets are free and reﬂect demand & supply, they pull together a huge amount of information • Prices convey information – all the information available to everyone – about the value of the thing and alternatives  (see Hayek’s 1945 address to AEA) • Two additional beneﬁts: –  Prices are free (or at least pretty cheap) –  Prices provide an incentive to act on the information •  Never , ever ignore market prices – believe markets –  If you disagree, you  might  be right but you are betting against many other smart people  

Hayek, 1945 address to the American Economic Association:  

A little reﬂection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientiﬁc in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he posses unique information of which beneﬁcial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation. We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any  
occupation after our theoretical training, how big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs, and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of people, of local conditions, and special circumstances. To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or somebody’s skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of a surplus stock which can be drawn down during an interruption of supplies, is socially quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques.  

# Types of Markets  

Cecchetti & Schoen holt z p 57  

• Primary vs Secondary  

–  Primary: governments or companies sell new securities –  Secondary: we all buy and sell existing securities  

• Centralized (auction) vs Over-the-Counter  

–  Centralized: Such as futures pits, where everyone gets together and prices set, usually by some auction process –  btw, I highly recommend the Eddie Murphy / Dan Akroyd 1983 movie “Trading Places” – good depiction of pit trading –  Over-the-Counter: individualized transactions between dealers and customers – US Treasury bonds  

• Underlying vs Derivative  

–  Underlying: instrument based on an asset and promised CFs –  Derivative: based on some other price. Example: futures, option

# Institutions  

Cecchetti & Schoen holt z pp 66-67  

I. Banks  

• Textbook  Depository Institutions  (1),  Finance Companies  (5) • I group these together because they both take short-term loans from the public and convert to long-term. Important regulatory di!erences, but economic & ﬁnancial functions similar. Maybe also GSEs. •  Finance Companies  often thought of as “shadow banking”  

II.  Broker Dealers or Securities Firms • Textbook  Securities Firms  (4)  

III.  Investment Managers and Pensions  

• Textbook  Pension Funds  (3) • Investment management terribly important, and under-represented in texts  

IV. Insurance Companies • Textbook  Insurance Companies  (2)

PV & TVM (Time Value of Money) comes from Micro I, budget line:  

•  Simple Budget Line  

• Cover again Lecture 3 0 0 m1/p1 • Simple, but most important idea in ﬁnance  
# Contents  

# Unpacking the Budget Line: PV, FV, Discounting  

Budget line – Start with 2 periods linked by savings: put in   $\S1$  , get   $\mathbb{S}1(1\!+\!y)$  • Start with no borrow / lend:    $s=0$   – single point • Next allow lending:    $s>0$  , extend line upper left (eliminate    $s$  ) • Finally borrowing   $\&$   lending:    $s<>0$  , full budget line  
$$
\begin{array}{c}{p_{1}c_{1}=m_{1}-s;\;p_{2}c_{2}=m_{2}+(1+y)s}\\ {p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}/(1+y)=m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)}\\ {p_{1}c_{1}\cdot(1+y)+p_{2}c_{2}=m_{1}\cdot(1+y)+m_{2}}\end{array}
$$  

• Can write as PV:    $m_{2}\big/1\!+\!y$   or FV:    $m_{1}\cdot(1+y)$  

• Budget line same either way  

• In FV form income higher, but so are “prices”  

• Note – have not used indi!erence curves – works for everyone  

 !500  
# Right Hand Side Gives PV, FV & Discounting  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}{{R H S:}}&{{P V:\:m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)}}\\ {{}}&{{F V:\:(1+y)\cdot m_{1}+m_{2}}}\end{array}
$$  

The RHS gives us the correct measure of  income  

•  Today’s  money we call Present Value or PV  

•  Tomorrow’s  money we call Future Value or FV  

This is the single most important idea in ﬁnance  

• If you understand this you understand most of ﬁnance  

• But I’ve spent most of my career learning, thinking, studying PV  

A little like building a bridge: the physics is easy but the engineering is hard  

I. Unpacking the budget constraint: PV, FV, nominal & real rates  

• This budget constraint tells us everything we need to know about discounting, PV, FV, nominal rates, real rates. In fact everything we need to know about TVM (for certain – known – CFs).  

• But we need to unpack this budget constraint, and think about it a little carefully.  

–  Once we do that we will then use the ideas of discounting, PV, FV, etc. to examine every aspect of modern ﬁnance. –  We will talk about bonds and discounting over multiple periods. About compounding and variable periods (rates per month, half-year, year). About nominal rates vs real rates. But the ideas all come back to this simple picture and simple budget line. (Have I ever said how wonderful budget lines are? I used to think they were really boring, but I’ve come to appreciate that a good part of economics is just thinking carefully about budget lines.)  

•  PV : So let’s start by looking at the RHS or the budget constraint:    $p_{1}c_{1}+p_{2}c_{2}/(1+$   $y)\,=\,m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . The RHS says that the income for the budget line is the sum  $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . We call this the Present Value, and it is the correct measure of income when we look at any set of CFs across time – we always need to discount future amounts (future CFs) back to today by   $1/(1\!+\!y)$  .  

–  This is the most important, maybe the only important thing, you will learn in this course: how to calculate and think about PVs. –  PVs matter and only PVs matter. Nothing else you learn in ﬁnance is as important as this. In fact, there really is not much else in ﬁnance except PV –  Three-quarters of this course is simply calculating    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  . This becomes very complicated: What are the CFs? When are the CFs? What is the rate    $y$  ? How do we quote the discount rate    $y$   and how do we calculate the discounting   $1/(1\!+\!y)$  ? How do we get an appropriate rate? –  But it all comes down to PV:    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$  .  

•  FV : the expression    $m_{1}+m_{2}/(1+y)$   expresses income in terms of period-1 money. But we could also write the budget line in terms of period-2 money:  
$$
p_{1}c_{1}\cdot(1+y)+p_{2}c_{2}=m_{1}\cdot(1+y)+m_{2}
$$  
Now the RHS is the FV:    $m_{1}\cdot(1+y)+m_{2}$  . FV is in terms of tomorrow’s money (PV is today’s money). For the budget line it is totally irrelevant, since it increases the income but also the prices on the LHS – the budget line does not change.  $\langle p_{1}\;\rightarrow\;p_{1}\cdot(1\;+$   $y)\,\&\,p_{2}/(1+y)\to p_{2}$  )  

II. The term (1+y) or    $\sqrt[1]{1\!+\!y}$   is the price between today and tomorrow.  

• For every   $\S1$   today, we get 1+y next period. For one year, y will be something like 0.04 or  $4\%$  . • The term    $\scriptstyle{1\mathord{\left/{\vphantom{11}}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace}1+y}$   is called the  discount factor : it tells us how much   $\S1$   next period is worth today (it will be less than   $\S1$  , discounted) • y is called the interest rate, discount rate, yield, yield-to-maturity, IRR (internal rate or return), expected return. These all mean slightly di!erent things.

How do I know the   $8.125\%$   of 15-may-21 was probably issued in 2009?  

• It is an old bond, either 2, 5, 10, or 30. • 5-year rates have not been 8.125% for the past ﬁve years, so can’t be an old 5-year • 30-year rates were about 8.125% in May 1991, so it was probably issued then • Also, 10 & 30yr bonds (maybe 5s? - I don’t think so) are issued with maturity date 15th

What is Bid & Asked?  

• Bid: Price dealer is willing to pay (low price – customer sells low) • Ask (o!er): Price dealer requires to sell (high price – customer buys high) • Customer always buys at the high price, sells at the low. • Dealer makes money from the Bid/Ask spread US Treasury quotes from Wall Street Journal: http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3020-treasury.html

• Table L.103 end-2017 Debt Securities (GSE issues): \$6,716.3bn • Table L.211 end-2017: \$8,867.2bn  Total of on-budget and o!-budge  $\S$  24.4bn  Budget Agencies such as Tennessee Valley Authority, Ex-Im Bank. Considered “onbudget” \$6,716.3bn  Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). Considered “o!-budget” or “o! balance sheet”  

\$2,126.6bn  Mortgage-backed pools from Agencies & GSEs. Considered “o!-budget”  

This compares with about \$12trn UST debt held by the public (and banks, etc). (from spread-sheet that takes apart FoF L.210 - \$14.9 marketable, \$2.2 non-marketable (  $\S$  17.1 total), but \$2.4 held by Fed and   $\S2.2$   retirement funds)  

The distinction between “on-budget” (an o"cial obligation of the federal government and included in o"cial deﬁcit numbers) and “o!-budget” (not o"cially an obligation and not included in o"cial deﬁcit numbers) is pretty artiﬁcial. Everybody kind-of knew that GSE debt was backed by the US government and we saw in 2008 that that belief was correct. Fannie and Freddie Mac (the two largest GSEs, involved in mortgage ﬁnancing) were supposedly public companies but on September 7, 2008 the government took them over and explicitly guaranteed their debt.

For 5-oct-18, From http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-bond b nch mr k.html?mod  $=$  topnav_2_3024

 (“Bond & Index Benchmarks”) and http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-bondyield.html?mod  $=$  topnav_2_302

 (“Bond Yields” for UST) But note that I think there’s a typo for “US Agency 10-20yr” – should be

  $3.30\%$   not   $3.03\%$  )  

# 3.227%  10-yr UST  
$\mathbf{3.300\%}$   US Agency 10-20yr (52 week spread 6-10bp)  
$\mathbf{3.910\%}$   Intermediate Corporate (spread 66-100bp)  

The Agency bonds are between the UST and the Corporates in terms of chance of default. We haven’t discussed default yet, but it is when you don’t get paid back what you get promised. Remember that bonds are “promised CFs” – there is a contract that says what you should get paid. If the contract gets broken, that is default.  

You should earn extra when there is a chance you won’t get the CFs you have been promised, and a higher yield reﬂects the higher amount you expect to earn. We will discuss default and risk-adjusted discounting and risk-adjusted yields in detail, but for now we will just look at the quoted yields and note that the US Agency yield is higher than the UST and lower than the Intermediate Corporate.  

The spread – the di!erence between yields – is the appropriate measure of default risk as we will see in a week or two. The UST yield is the pure TVM discount rate, reﬂecting the pure trade-o! between today and tomorrow for known CFs. The Agency and Intermediate Corporate also have a component that reﬂects the uncertainty (the fact you might not get your CF). The higher yield or discount rate is the risk-adjusted discount rate. The di!erence or spread is a measure of the default risk.  
# Other Government Bonds  

Every developed and many (most) developing nations have bonds Ideas are virtually all the same:  

• Periodic coupon, with ﬁnal 100 payment  

• Some pay annual coupon, others semi-annual  

List of some:  

• UK Gilts (for “Gilt-Edged” stock”)  

• French BTAN (1-6yr) and OAT (Obligations as simi lab les du Trésor) 7 to 50 year  

• German Bunds (Schatz, Bobls, Bunds)  

• Italy BTPs  

My “Practical Guide to Bonds and Swaps” (https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract  $,=$  1554029) covers the various conventions. Many, however, have changed and are now A/A.

Sources for conventions:  

• http://treasury today.com/2001/11/day-count-conventions  

–  I’m not sure they are right in their deﬁnition of A/365(F) and A/365 (that they say is same as A/A). I think maybe there is some confusion between mm conventions (A/360 and A/365) and bond conventions (A/365(F) and A/A) –  They say that Eurobonds have switched from 30E/360 to A/A

# Money Markets – Short-Term Debt  

Subsector of the ﬁxed-income market  

• Short-term • Liquid • Low risk • Often have large denominations UST: TBills (0-1yr), about   $14\%$   of all gov’t debt  

From Fed Reserve Flow of Funds (z1):  

• Table L.210, 2018:Q2. Total Marketable UST \$14,933.7bn, TBills \$2,157.4bn   $(14.4\%)$  

 !500  

For comparison, total US bond market in 2017 \$41,020bn  

These numbers are from a table in Bodie, Kane, Marcus. They give source as “ Flow of Funds Accounts ” from the Board of Governors of the Fed (the z1 report). I started tracking down and the relevant tables appear to be L.205-L.210. I couldn’t ﬁnd the split between large & small time deposits but otherwise rough match.  
# 6.2 Types of Securities  

# Contents  

# Various Types of Securities  

Treasury Bills (government)  

• Discount: pay \$98 today for   $\S100$   in 1 year  

• Quote: Bank Discount – above would be   $2\%$  .  

• Actual discount = Quote \* (AD/360)  

Commercial Paper (corporations)  

• Discount like T-Bills  

Certiﬁcate of Deposit (CD, banks)  

• Add-on yield. Actual coupon = Quote \* AD/360 • Can be small (for you & me) or large (  $>$  \$100,000)  

Bank Deposits – Eurodollar Deposits (banks)  

• Basically same as CD • LIBOR – London Interbank O"ered Rate: 11am (London) quote for Eurodollar deposit

The trick with money-market securities, as with any ﬁxed-income security, is to ﬁgure out the CFs. Then we can PV or do whatever we need to.  

Virtually all money-market instruments (at least those with 1 year or less maturity) have a single future CF, with a diagram like the Eurodollar deposit above. A more detailed table (for US money-market instruments) follows. I know some of the quoting conventions but don’t know others.

# Some Additional Short-Term Debt  

Money Market Funds • Individuals and corporations put money into MMF • MMF then buys other short-term debt (such as T-Bills or CP) • We use them like checking (deposit, bank accounts) • History: developed in response to Req-Q restrictions Checking Account (bank deposit) • Usually think of this as “money” • But better to think of lending money to a bank
