Though it’s also great if you have. We’re more interested in talent, curiosity, and analytical thinking than in any particular skill or experience, and we’re excited to see how you’ve demonstrated initiative and what you’ve achieved.

Employees in these groups engage in wide-ranging, collaborative endeavors using the rigorous analysis and project management skills they’ve developed while at the firm and elsewhere.\n\nOur discretionary investment strategies rely primarily on human analysis to discover, analyze, and pursue attractive investment opportunities that span public and private markets around the globe. Traders and research analysts drive investment decision-making, and they integrate a number of technological tools and analytical techniques into their approach.\n\nOur strategy and business development groups evaluate complex questions that influence our long-term direction, including ones related to marketplace dynamics, product design and marketing strategy, analysis of firm profitability, and opportunities for strategic expansion. Members of these groups take on projects that require rigorous analytical thinking and creative problem solving, such as investigating which markets our investment strategies should target for expansion, evaluating whether and where to open a new office, researching prospective new investors for our funds, or developing a plan for launching a new fund.\n\nOur systematic investment strategies run on quantitative and computational techniques that we’ve developed over more than 35 years of research and trading. We believe that rigorous analysis and scientific research, supported by robust data and technological infrastructure, is the bedrock of successful systematic investing. Members of our systematic investing teams conduct research on innovative systematic forecasting, risk management, and portfolio construction techniques that form the basis of our process.\n\nOur systems teams oversee and support our enterprise-level technology and network infrastructure, including the storage and clustered computing solutions used across the firm. Members of these teams design and develop technology that supports initiatives related to core systems, application engineering, platform engineering, database infrastructure, productivity and collaboration, web development, and information security.\n\nIn addition to having access to a wide range of firmwide resources, including our staff-led affinity groups, you’ll take part in an exciting intern development program that includes trainings, talks with industry and academic experts, and social activities.\n\nWe’ll support your summer experience through:\n\n- Housing, technology, and travel accommodations\n- Vast educational resources for self-guided learning\n- Mentorship opportunities, coffee chats, and small group lunches with full-time employees\n- Corporate memberships at local cultural institutions\n- Subsidized fitness options, including gym and Citi Bike memberships\n\nYou’ll also get to explore the world beyond our offices through experiences such as arts performances, sporting events, and dining and social events.\n\n4.4.4\n\n## The Work: Real Projects\n\nAs an intern, you’ll work individually and in teams to tackle complex projects that directly influence the firm’s business decisions.\n\nBelow are some examples of past intern projects:\n\n- Developing and presenting a recommendation on an information security hardware company (Fundamental Research Analyst Intern)\n- Comparing methods for detecting changes in risk environments and notable shifts in market dynamics (Generalist Intern)\n- Reviewing macro-level conditions in an emerging market country and understanding the drivers of its currency (Proprietary Trader Intern)\n- Developing a new risk factor based on social media sentiment scoring using natural language processing techniques (Quantitative Analyst Intern)\n- Writing a parallel hyperparameter optimization library that reduces the execution time of simulations while maintaining their quality (Software Developer Intern)\n- Exploring how the firm might extend its private credit franchise in the Asia-Pacific region (Strategy and Business Development Intern)\n- Enhancing the firm’s authorization system with an event-driven approach to updates (Systems: Engineering Intern)\n\nMost of our interns work in our New York City headquarters.

    "notes" : "At the D. E. Shaw group, we devote care and attention to identifying, recruiting, and supporting world-class talent.\n\nWe recognize that finding the right place for your next career step can be time consuming, if not all consuming. So that you can put your best foot forward, we want to help you understand our firm, how you can contribute to its future, and how it can contribute to yours.\n\nWe hope you find the following information helpful as you prepare to meet with us.\n\n- **Uphold high standards**: We want to understand how you uphold high standards. What practices do you follow to ensure you treat colleagues and peers with respect and professionalism? How have you handled ethical decision-making in the past?\n- **Analyze rigorously**: We’re eager to hear what you’ve learned from your experiences. What would you do differently in retrospect? How could you have improved an outcome? What questions would you tackle next? We’re interested in the thinking that guided your approach and how you assessed the result.\n- **Communicate clearly and concisely**: Details and enthusiasm make for great answers, but only if they make sense in the context of the questions asked. Remember the essence of what you’re trying to communicate. Pause and organize your thoughts to structure your answers. Recap the problem you were trying to solve before explaining how you approached it.\n- **Thrive on collaboration**: We often work in groups, small and large, so we care about your contributions as a member of a team. How have you learned from and shared your insights with others? How have you tackled challenging projects with peers? What role(s) do you most enjoy as part of a group?\n- **Demonstrate intellectual curiosity**: Whether it’s your research, jobs or internships, past projects, classes, extracurriculars, or something else altogether, we want to hear about your passions, areas of expertise, and what motivates you.\n\n- **Tell your story**: Your experience is more than a series of bullet points on a resume. What have been your motivations, ambitions, and thinking at key moments in your education or career? What drives you? How has your approach to work evolved? We’re also curious to learn things beyond your resume, like accomplishments outside of work or school, or additional fields of interest.\n- **Dig deep into your experiences**: Be prepared to explore the details behind the jobs, activities, and projects on your resume (without disclosing anything confidential, of course). What were their challenges, and how did you learn from them? How did you work with teammates to achieve your goals? What was the thought process behind your work?\n- **Ask us questions**: An interview is a two-way street, and we encourage you to use the time to learn more about us. Ask us questions that can help you make decisions about your next career steps, assess how working with us might address things you find important, and reveal the depth of your curiosity.\n\n**Tip**: One way to help effectively communicate your ideas, experiences, and what interests you about our firm is to practice telling your story out loud and verbally responding to potential questions. You can ask a friend, career counselor, or recruiter to be your audience, or just use a mirror or video camera.\n\nYou can expect a range of questions on your past experiences (**behavioral questions**), hypothetical situations you might come across in your work with us (**situational questions**), and in-depth prompts that demonstrate your capacity for analytical thinking based on real-world examples (**case studies**). These questions are meant to help us better understand your proficiency in skills relevant to the role you’re interviewing for.\n\nCase studies are questions or prompts based on real-world situations that ask how you might tackle a specific problem or challenge. A case study may include discussion with an interviewer, a written response, or an exercise similar to work one might do in the role. We use case studies to learn about how you process new information, weigh which data are most important, assess the pros and cons of different approaches, and justify and present your recommendations.\n\nWe’ve included a few examples of different question types below.\n\n- How has your approach to solving a specific problem evolved with more experience or new information?\n- When have you collaborated with a team to achieve goals?\n- How have you impacted the teams you’ve worked on? What were your individual contributions?\n\n- How would you approach building relationships if you were new to a project or team?\n- What would you do if you were working on a project and weren’t sure about your next steps?\n- Imagine that you need to make a decision that isn’t clear-cut. How would you weigh the pros and cons?\n\n- Company X is trying to decide whether to renovate its office space or move to a new location. What factors would you consider to help make a recommendation?\n- What businesses or industries do you think will be impacted by shifts in energy production to renewable sources?\n\nInterviews for **trading and fundamental analyst roles** do not assume pre-existing technical or financial knowledge, but will assess your comfort applying statistical and logical reasoning.\n\nFor **technical roles**, including those in **quantitative analysis** and **software development**, you’ll be asked questions from different areas of mathematics and\/or computer science in addition to behavioral questions. These technical questions aim to evaluate what techniques, concepts, or algorithms you use to pursue a solution, and how deeply you understand their uses and limitations. Technical questions may cover probability, mathematical statistics, algorithms, logical thinking, and\/or programming.\n\nInterviews for **systems-focused roles** may similarly seek to evaluate your computer science and programming competencies or your subject matter expertise. These interviews could include questions that assess your understanding of complex computational processes and interactions within distributed systems, as well as your operational problem-solving.\n\nFor **non-technical roles**, the majority of your interviews will consist of behavioral and situational questions, and interviewers will follow up to get more detail. For certain roles, you may be asked analytical questions that encourage you to apply logical reasoning in forming an answer.\n\nHaving the following in mind can be useful as you respond to case study prompts or analytical questions:\n\n- **Do you understand the question?** Before diving in, make sure you know what you’re being asked. If you’re not certain, feel free to ask for clarification (we do this routinely in our day-to-day work). As you move forward with your response, check in with your interviewer to see if they’re following your thought process.\n- **How do you want to approach solving the problem?** As you organize your thoughts, consider the structure you’d want to follow as you work. Think about any follow-up questions you’d like to ask your interviewer.\n- **What are your assumptions?** Be aware of any assumptions you’re making, and share these with your interviewer to help them follow your thinking.\n- **What potential solutions have you identified?** Be sure your potential solutions directly assess the problem. Do you have a systematic way to identify the best solution? If so, how are you assessing the pros, cons, and trade-offs of that solution relative to other possible approaches?\n- **How are your solutions supported?** As applicable, check that your answer is supported by your quantitative and\/or qualitative analysis. Are you providing a rationale for why a certain solution is best? How would other information change your assessment?\n- **What would your next steps be?** Showing your interviewer that you can grasp the broader context and can offer insights into the implications of your analysis separates a great answer from a good one. Can you think of additional risks and next steps?\n\n**Tip**: Keep similar principles in mind when responding to behavioral and situational prompts: “show your work” by accounting for any assumptions you’re making and sharing the information you’re using (or that you’d seek) to inform your approach.\n\n**The typical stages of a successful hiring process include the following**: application review, phone interview and virtual interviews, references, and finally an offer.\n\n**We don’t take shortcuts** when it comes to recruiting and developing extraordinary talent, so our hiring process might take several weeks. We’ll do our best to keep you updated, but don’t hesitate to reach out to your recruiter if you have any questions.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about [Who We Are](https:\/\/www.deshaw.com\/who-we-are?source=interviewingguide) and [What We Do](https:\/\/www.deshaw.com\/what-we-do?source=interviewingguide). Good luck with your interview!",

    "coverLetter" : "### Introduction:\nMorgan Stanley is one of the most highly respected financial institutions in the world. Its name on your resume will open doors throughout your career. Morgan Stanley is a global leader in mergers and acquisitions, IPO underwriting, investment management, and wealth management. It's also passionate about philanthropic efforts, especially when it comes to assisting children and those in dire financial need. Recently, the firm made great strides when it comes to creating a more diverse workforce.\n\n### Company Stats:\n*   **Employer Type:** Public\n*   **Size:** 10,001+ Employees\n*   **Featured Rankings:** Vault Banking 25\n*   **Major Office Locations:** National\n*   **Career Site:** [Morgan Stanley Career Site](https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/people)\n*   **News Site:** [Morgan Stanley News Site](https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/about-us-newsroom)\n*   **Chairman and CEO:** Ted Pick\n\n### Assessment:\nOne of the most prestigious financial institutions in the world, Morgan Stanley is ideally looking for well-rounded, technically-sound, intellectual curious, motivated fast-learners with integrity, strong communication skills, and a specific interest in the firm. For students, Morgan Stanley runs highly valuable internship programs. Investment banking interns get a lot of early responsibility on live transactions, while sales and trading interns get the ability to rotate on multiple desks, shadowing salespeople and traders. All interns get access to senior professionals, training, and many networking opportunities. Meanwhile, the firm’s full-time professionals have access to extensive growth opportunities, including significant early responsibility, mentoring, formal training programs, and internal mobility options (the ability to move to other groups within the firm).\n\nDepending on which group you work in, hours can be long and unpredictable and it can be difficult to disconnect while on vacation. However, Morgan Stanley supports work\/life balance, and senior professionals are generally very accommodating, honoring juniors’ personal commitments. While compensation is competitive, insiders say the firm’s bonuses are typically below average and salaries are merely average. Benefits, though, are very generous and include numerous wellness offerings, including gym discounts, free meditation apps, nutrition education, and free counseling.\n\nDE&I is another strong suit at Morgan Stanley, as the firm is very intentional in recruiting a diverse population. According to insiders, the firm is especially strong when it comes to hiring women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and veterans. With respect to Morgan Stanley’s business outlook, the future is very bright. The firm continues to grow its investment banking and wealth management businesses, building on their long histories of success. Firm goals are communicated effectively. And employees have a lot of confidence in the firm’s excellent leadership team, including CEO Ted Pick.\n\n### About the Company:\nNew York-headquartered financial services giant Morgan Stanley is divided into three core businesses: Institutional Securities, Investment Management, and Wealth Management. Institutional Securities include investment banking (M&A advisory, restructuring, real estate, project finance, capital raising), global capital markets (IPO, follow-ons) equity and fixed-income sales and trading, and corporate lending. Investment management includes institutional investment products and mutual funds across a range of fixed-income, equity, and alternative investments. Wealth management provides financial planning and wealth management services, annuities and insurance, and brokerage and investment advisory services that cover a wide range of investment alternatives.\n\nThe firm’s history can be traced to 1935, when J.P. Morgan & Co...\n\n### Why Work Here:\n*   **Highlights:**\n    *   You are encouraged to use your creativity to tackle complex problems.\n    *   You’ll find opportunities to innovate every day, including as a technologist.\n    *   You’ll have the chance to work at a company where diversity is highly-valued.\n    *   You’ll be encouraged to give back to your community.\n*   **Awards & Recognition:** Not explicitly mentioned in this section, but the Vault Rankings section provides this information.\n\n### Employee Reviews:\n*   **Quality of Life:**\n    *   “My team appreciates and highlights taking time off and providing a solid work\/life balance. I have limited amounts of work on the weekends, and I feel that everyone is respectful of my time in and out of the office.”\n    *   “Lots of work and lean teams means that you have a lot of exposure and experience to clients and deals. However, that comes at the cost of longer hours and limited ability to take true vacation time where you are fully unplugged.”\n    *   “The firm is deliberate about implementing policies that support good quality of life. In recent months, the firm has hired several lateral associates to support the number of MDs and increased deal flow we are experiencing. The staffer does a great job managing people’s vacation requests so you don’t have to be ‘available’ when you are away.”\n    *   “The team is generally very accommodating on honoring personal commitments and protecting personal life. However, it is exceptionally difficult to ever disconnect. I personally have canceled vacations each of the past few years, so now only schedule in the few windows where things are slowest (and even then, it’s prone to interruption).”\n*   **Compensation:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n*   **Career Development:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n*   **Community Engagement:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n*   **Business Outlook:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n*   **Intern Experience:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n*   **More Insights:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n\n### Getting Hired Here:\n*   **Hiring Process:**\n    *   The firm's interview process is very competitive. The process takes time; the hiring timeline is never going to be as quick as the candidate wants. The ideal candidate is a thoughtful, execution-oriented person. Someone who can learn quickly, analyze information, make connections and provide actionable insights. Strong communication, analytical, problem-solving skills.\n    *   Our firm has three to four rounds of interviews, including an initial HR screen, one to two rounds of an interview with a hiring manager and future colleague, and a senior management interview for more senior roles.\n*   **Interview Questions:**\n    *   “The ideal candidate is someone who is intelligent, able to think outside the box, able to dig into data to look for patterns and issues that may be monetizable and is respectful and easy to work with.”\n    *   “The firm is not necessarily looking for individuals with a finance or economics educational background but for highly motivated individuals who bring different perspective to the table. They want to work with fast learners who have a keen interest in the culture of our firm.”\n    *   “The ideal candidates need to possess the required skills, have integrity, are willing and able to learn quickly, and have good problem-solving skills.”",

The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one.

Skills: Financial Modelling | Financial Analysis | Risk Management Data Analytics, Proficient in Python, R, Stata, SQL, Tableau, Power BI Communication | Public Speaking | Leadership Fun Facts: I enjoy meditation, mindfulness, and bungee jumping.

    "coverLetter" : "Dear Hiring Manager,\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Futures Relative Value Trader position at Belvedere Trading, and I am eager to bring my unique background and passion for quantitative finance to your innovative team in New York. I am currently a Master’s candidate at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, specializing in Finance, and I have honed my analytical and quantitative skills through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects that have prepared me for the dynamic challenges of the proprietary trading industry. I have always been captivated by the fast-paced nature of financial markets and the intricate balance between risk management and aggressive market making, which aligns perfectly with the responsibilities of the role at Belvedere Trading. My academic journey has provided me with a deep understanding of relative value strategies and futures trading, which I have complemented with practical experience in Python programming and quantitative analysis. I am particularly drawn to Belvedere Trading because of your commitment to iterative innovation and a collaborative, team-oriented culture that fosters passionate discourse and continuous improvement. I appreciate that your firm values diverse perspectives and is dedicated to creating a positive environment where every team member is encouraged to “Own It” and contribute meaningfully to the collective success. I am confident that my interdisciplinary approach, combining rigorous public policy analysis with financial theory, will allow me to excel in developing and managing futures trading strategies that enhance liquidity and drive value. I look forward to the possibility of contributing my unique skill set to your team and further developing my expertise under the guidance of seasoned professionals at Belvedere Trading.\n\nThroughout my academic and project experiences, I have developed a robust proficiency in quantitative techniques and risk management that directly complements the technical skills required for this role. I have undertaken several complex research projects that required me to model financial markets using Python, where I designed and implemented algorithms to identify pricing discrepancies and relative value opportunities, demonstrating my capability to integrate technology with financial theory. I have engaged deeply with topics such as market microstructure and ETF trading, which have provided me with a solid foundation in the underlying mechanics of market making and futures trading strategies. My experience working with statistical models and econometric analyses has enabled me to distill large datasets into actionable insights, which is critical for identifying arbitrage opportunities and managing trading risks effectively. I have also collaborated with diverse teams on data-driven projects, ensuring that all perspectives are considered when developing and iterating on quantitative models, a process that mirrors the “Team Belvedere” ethos. These experiences have not only refined my technical skills but have also instilled in me a disciplined approach to risk management, which is essential in a high-stakes trading environment. I take pride in my ability to balance analytical rigor with creative problem-solving, ensuring that I can adapt quickly to evolving market conditions. My commitment to continuous learning and innovation makes me confident that I can add immediate value to your team and contribute to the ongoing evolution of your trading models and systems.\n\nI am aware that my academic background in public policy, albeit specialized in finance, might initially be viewed as nontraditional for a role in proprietary trading, yet I firmly believe that this interdisciplinary experience is one of my strongest assets. My rigorous training at the University of Chicago has equipped me with a deep understanding of the regulatory, economic, and statistical frameworks that underpin financial markets, allowing me to approach trading strategies with a broader and more informed perspective. This background has fostered in me a unique ability to analyze market movements not just from a quantitative standpoint, but also by considering the macroeconomic and policy-driven factors that influence market behavior. I have consistently leveraged this dual perspective to innovate and adapt, whether through developing predictive models or implementing risk management strategies that mitigate downside exposure while maximizing returns. My experience in academic research and policy analysis has taught me the value of data integrity and rigorous validation, skills that are directly transferable to developing and fine-tuning trading algorithms. I have also learned to thrive in collaborative settings where diverse viewpoints and iterative improvements drive the best outcomes, a principle that resonates with Belvedere Trading’s core values of “Me In Team” and “Iterative Innovation.” I am eager to demonstrate that my unorthodox academic journey has prepared me to excel in the fast-paced, data-centric world of futures trading. I am confident that the combination of my quantitative prowess, analytical discipline, and proactive problem-solving approach positions me uniquely to drive success in the Futures Relative Value Trader role.\n\nIn conclusion, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Belvedere Trading’s continued success as a Futures Relative Value Trader, and I am eager to bring my strong analytical foundation, technical expertise, and collaborative spirit to your team. I am committed to leveraging my skills in quantitative analysis, Python programming, and risk management to enhance your existing ETF and futures trading infrastructure, and I am particularly drawn to the prospect of working in an environment that values team-oriented innovation and passionate discourse. I firmly believe that my interdisciplinary background, combining public policy insights with financial acumen, offers a distinctive perspective that can drive creative solutions and robust trading strategies. I am prepared to take ownership of challenging projects and to engage deeply with both market data and team dynamics to deliver consistent value. My previous experiences have shown me the importance of continuous learning and agile adaptation in high-pressure environments, which I am eager to bring to Belvedere Trading. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the responsibilities of the Futures Relative Value Trader role. I am confident that my passion for the markets, combined with a disciplined and innovative approach to problem-solving, will allow me to contribute significantly to your team’s success. Thank you for considering my application, and I am excited about the possibility of contributing to a firm that shares my commitment to excellence and iterative innovation.\n\nSincerely,\nRoger Lin",

    "coverLetter" : "RE: JPMorgan Chase 2026 Markets Summer Analyst Program\n\nDear Hiring Manager, \n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the 2026 Markets Summer Analyst Program at JPMorgan Chase. As a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at UChicago's Harris School, I am particularly drawn to JPMorgan's leadership in global markets and the opportunity to contribute to sophisticated financial solutions across asset classes.\n\nI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk between different market participants. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of market dynamics, trading strategies, and the macroeconomic factors that drive market movements. Through the MPP program's rigorous quantitative curriculum, I have developed a strong foundation in financial analysis and statistical methods, complemented by technical proficiency in Python, R, and Stata. My coursework at Harris and the Booth School of Business encompasses Financial Instruments, Fixed Income Asset Pricing, Corporate Finance, and advanced Statistics for Data Analysis, providing me with comprehensive exposure to both theoretical frameworks and practical applications in financial markets.\n\nMy professional experience has equipped me with strong analytical capabilities and a client-focused mindset essential for sales and trading roles. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I demonstrated my ability to analyze complex market dynamics and develop strategic recommendations. Working closely with a startup client, we conducted detailed market research, identified competitive advantages, and formulated actionable growth strategies. This experience honed my ability to synthesize market information and communicate complex insights effectively to stakeholders – skills crucial for client interactions in Markets roles.\n\nThis past summer, as a research assistant at UChicago's Becker Friedman Institute, I had the opportunity to apply sophisticated quantitative analysis to real-world market dynamics. My research focused on examining the relationship between inflation regimes and asset returns, requiring me to analyze historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. This role strengthened my capabilities in data analysis, econometric modeling, and market research – competencies that align directly with JPMorgan's Markets platform's analytical demands.\n\nWhat particularly attracts me to JPMorgan's Markets division is the opportunity to work at the intersection of client service and market analysis. I am especially interested in the Sales track, where I can leverage both my quantitative skills and communication abilities to help clients navigate market complexities and develop tailored solutions. The dynamic nature of global markets and the challenge of responding to market-moving events with quick, analytical decision-making strongly appeals to my intellectual curiosity and problem-solving mindset.\n\nMy experience helping run my family's small business instilled in me a deep sense of ownership and accountability – values that resonate strongly with JPMorgan's culture. This background has taught me the importance of building long-term relationships and delivering consistent results, principles that I understand are crucial in maintaining JPMorgan's market leadership position.\n\nI am excited about the prospect of contributing to JPMorgan's Markets platform and learning from industry leaders in global financial markets. My combination of quantitative expertise, research experience, and strong communication skills would enable me to add immediate value to your team while growing within JPMorgan's collaborative environment. I look forward to discussing how my skills and perspectives align with JPMorgan's commitment to excellence in global markets.\n\t\n\nBest regards,  \nRoger Lin \n \n\f",

What draws me to this role is JPMorgan's leadership in quantitative modeling and financial engineering, combined with the opportunity to contribute to innovative solutions in derivatives pricing and risk management. My academic background in economics, finance, and public policy, along with my quantitative research experience, I believe, makes me an ideal candidate for this position.\n\nI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk between different market participants. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the mathematical foundations of derivatives pricing and risk measurement. Through the MPP program's heavy quantitative focus, I have developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using Python, R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. My relevant courses at Harris and the Booth School of Business encompass Financial Instruments, Fixed Income Asset Pricing, Corporate Finance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Statistics for Data Analysis, and Macroeconomic Policymaking. Through these courses, I have gained deep exposure to probability theory, stochastic calculus, and numerical methods essential for quantitative research and financial engineering.\n\nMy professional experience has equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped advise a local startup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. In treating the client as a long-term growth partner we were investing alongside, we made sure that our proposals aligned with what was best for the company. My prior involvement in helping run my parent's small business taught me this invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner early on. This perspective, rooted in a sense of ownership and accountability for decision outcomes, has been a guiding principle in my approach to work.\n\nThis past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago's Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation regimes and asset returns by analyzing historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My responsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning datasets, running sophisticated regression analyses and interpreting the econometric outcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends, and conducting literature reviews on prior works studying the relationship between inflation and asset returns. This experience was particularly valuable in allowing me to apply advanced statistical methods to complex financial problems while developing practical programming skills in data analysis and modeling.\n\nI am especially interested in JPMorgan's quantitative research initiatives in electronic trading and portfolio optimization. The opportunity to work on developing mathematical models for derivatives pricing, algorithmic trading strategies, and risk management systems aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations. My strong foundation in quantitative methods, combined with my understanding of financial markets and programming capabilities, would enable me to contribute effectively to JPMorgan's continued innovation in quantitative finance. I look forward to discussing how my quantitative skills, research abilities, and passion for financial innovation can contribute to your team's success.\n\nBest regards,  \nRoger Lin \n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n\nRoger Lin  \n1043 Don Diablo Drive  \nArcadia, CA 91006  \n646-354-1035  \nlinroger023@uchicago.edu  \n\n[Today’s Date]  \n\nHiring Manager  \nJPMorgan Chase  \nHong Kong  \n\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am excited to apply for the Summer Analyst & Associate position in the Markets Quantitative Analytics Program at JPMorgan Chase as advertised. With my background in public policy, economics, and quantitative analysis demonstrated through my experience and education, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and drive innovation in financial engineering and risk management.\n\nCurrently, I am pursuing a Master of Public Policy at the University of Chicago with a focus on finance and policy. My coursework includes advanced econometrics, financial instruments, and macroeconomic policymaking, providing me with a solid foundation in quantitative analysis and financial modeling. My experience as a Research Professional at the Becker Friedman Institute has sharpened my analytical skills, where I conducted an extensive examination of inflation-asset return dynamics and analyzed market data for inflation swaps and Treasury yields to project inflation expectations. This experience has honed my ability to utilize statistical methods to model complex financial scenarios, which aligns perfectly with the goals of the J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research team.\n\nDuring my internship at Bainbridge Strategic Consulting, I developed dynamic financial models to forecast company performance and performed scenario analyses, demonstrating my ability to analyze and communicate quantitative data effectively. Additionally, my proficiency in programming languages, including Python, further equips me to contribute to the algorithmic trading strategies and derivative pricing tasks outlined in the job description.\n\nI am particularly drawn to this position because of J.P. Morgan’s commitment to innovation and the impact of quantitative analytics on investment banking. Through my leadership as the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Triton Business Review, I have successfully communicated complex economic insights to a broad audience, enhancing my ability to articulate technical concepts clearly and engagingly.\n\nI am eager to bring my strong quantitative skills, research abilities, and passion for financial analytics to JPMorgan Chase.

    "companyName" : "Scotiabank",
    "coverLetter" : "RE: Scotiabank Investment Banking Analyst\/Associates Program\n\nDear Hiring Manager, \n\n \tMy name is Roger Lin, and I am currently a Research Professional at the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago, and a recent graduate of the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy with a Master's in Public Policy specializing in Finance and Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Investment Banking Analyst\/Associate position at Scotiabank. I am drawn to the opportunity to join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high-performing culture, as described in the position overview. The prospect of a stimulating and challenging work environment where I can execute a broad range of transactions particularly excites me, aligning perfectly with my aspirations for a career in investment banking. The high degree of responsibility afforded to those demonstrating initiative is also a significant draw. My academic background in economics, finance, and public policy, combined with my proven record of outstanding achievement in academic and extracurricular activities, I believe, makes me a well-suited candidate for this role. I have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk between different market participants. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the key value drivers of an individual firm’s returns, aligning with the need to apply product and capital markets knowledge to help clients achieve their financial objectives. Through the MPP program’s heavy quantitative focus, I have developed strong quantitative skills focused on financial analysis, accounting and financial theory, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using Python, R and Stata, data-driven decision making, and financial modeling, directly relevant to evaluating and analyzing the financial needs of corporate clients, including the development of financial models. Moreover, through my coursework at the Booth School of Business, I have had the opportunity to deepen my financial valuation and equity research skills using datasources such as CapitalIQ Pro, Visible Alpha, and Bloomberg Terminal to perform company valuations and make data-driven investment recommendations.\n\n\tMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis, essential for performing comprehensive financial statement analysis and creating and maintaining models. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I performed in-depth industry research and peer company assessments, and built dynamic financial models forecasting company performance, mirroring the responsibilities of collecting, consolidating, and interpreting company and industry data. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. This experience honed my ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously while maintaining a high standard of work. My team and I continued to liaise with the company long after the project’s completion to track their progress and to advise on any strategic adjustments to the business plan, demonstrating my commitment to the task at hand and ability to identify and develop business opportunities with clients. In treating the firm as a long-term growth partner, each member of our team took accountability for the plan we presented, and sought to continuously learn and improve alongside our client. My past experience of helping run my parent's small business taught me this invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner early on, reflecting the high professional standards including a strong sense of personal integrity and teamwork that I bring. This perspective, rooted in a sense of accountability for decision outcomes and desire to continuously improve and learn, has been a guiding principle in my approach to life and work.\n\n\tAs a Research Professional at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, I am currently applying my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skills to an ongoing study examining the link between inflation and asset returns, with a particular focus on the historical correlation between equity and bond excess returns under different inflation regimes. So far, this has involved conducting thorough literature reviews, where I've synthesized existing research and identified key areas for further exploration. I’ve also gained significant experience in compiling and cleaning large datasets, a crucial step for the rigorous econometric analysis I then perform to interpret our findings. Furthermore, I've developed my communication skills by drafting memos summarizing the study's key insights for both academic and policy-focused audiences. This work directly relates to the skills required for preparing client presentations, including compiling and presenting data, and supporting the creation of transaction-related documents. Through this experience, I've gained invaluable insights into applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and empirically understanding how macroeconomic trends impact investment returns. I am adept at performing effectively in a team environment, possess a high level of attention to detail, and have consistently demonstrated the ability to excel under pressure amid demanding deadlines – qualities crucial for supporting transaction structuring and execution efforts. My strong written and verbal communication skills allow me to effectively contribute to the creation of compelling marketing materials and presentations. At your firm, I am eager to further develop these skills and contribute my ability to quickly adapt to new situations, alongside my high level of energy and keen desire to learn more about capital and debt. Markets through the Investment Banking Analyst\/ Associates position. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further and how I can contribute to your team's success.\nBest regards,\nRoger Lin \n",

    "companyName" : "Lido Advisors",
    "coverLetter" : "To Lido Advisors Recruitment Manager,\r\n\r\nMy name is Roger Lin, and I am currently a Research Assistant at the Becker Friedman Institute and a recent graduate of the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy, where I earned my Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Options Trading Analyst position at Lido Advisors’ Los Angeles Office. What drew me to this role specifically is Lido Advisors’ collaborative culture and focus on quantitatively driven trading strategies. This environment immediately appealed to me as one where I could leverage my current research experience and strong academic foundation to grow professionally and personally, allowing me to collaborate with and learn from experienced professionals in the field.\r\n\r\nI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk across diverse investors. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my understanding of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors that influence them, and the pricing of different asset classes, with a particular focus on derivatives such as options. Through the MPP program’s rigorous quantitative curriculum, I have developed a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics, and honed my technical competencies in statistical analysis using R and Stata, data-driven decision-making, financial modeling, and research. Such skills are readily transferable to a context of trading, where the ability to analyze market trends, volatility, and price movements is crucial for identifying trading opportunities. For instance, the emphasis on isolating the effect of a given policy treatment in a public policy context mirrors the evaluation of trading strategy performance, adjusting for risk and correlation with the market.\r\n\r\nMy relevant finance coursework at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, has provided me with a strong theoretical understanding directly applicable to this role. Notably, my coursework in Financial Instruments provided an intensive immersion into the world of financial derivatives. Through this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of options trading, including the theoretical underpinnings of options pricing through models such as Black-Scholes, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, Heston, and Ho-Lee. Furthermore, I gained practical experience using market data to calculate implied volatility and options prices, and developed and analyzed various options trading strategies. My additional coursework in Corporate Finance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Microeconomics for Public Policy, Macroeconomic Policymaking, and Financial Markets and Institutions, has provided a broader understanding of market dynamics and financial instruments. Moreover, my upcoming Winter quarter coursework in Financial Mathematics - Stochastic Calculus, and Quantitative Trading Strategies will further deepen my understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of derivatives pricing and advanced trading methodologies.\r\n\r\nMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis and data analysis. During my tenure as a Business Analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I honed my ability to process large datasets and derive actionable insights while advising a local startup. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. This experience instilled in me the importance of a data-driven approach to decision-making, a skill that is crucial for backtesting options strategies using historical data and evaluating their performance using statistical models, as described in the job duties. My experience at Bainbridge also fostered a collaborative approach, working closely with the client to achieve their goals, mirroring the collaborative environment at Lido Advisors where the Options Trading Analyst will work with investment management and advisors to optimize clients’ portfolio performance.\r\n\r\nIn my current position as a Research Assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, I applied my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skills in a practical setting, studying the link between inflation regimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My responsibilities included compiling and cleaning datasets, running regressions and interpreting econometric outcomes, and preparing data visualizations. This experience directly aligns with the requirement to conduct quantitative and qualitative research on options strategies and underlying assets, and to prepare reports on market conditions and trade performance.\r\n\r\nThe Options Trading Analyst position at Lido Advisors presents an ideal platform from which to explore and continuously refine my understanding of financial markets, particularly options trading. My strong foundation in financial instruments and derivatives, coupled with my eagerness to learn and adapt to new tools and trading strategies, makes me a well-suited candidate. I am particularly excited by the prospect of assisting in the execution of options trades, monitoring open positions, and creating options trading strategies and backtesting them on historical data. My curiosity and eagerness to take on new challenges will be invaluable assets in this role. I am confident that my strong quantitative abilities, my understanding of options trading principles gained through rigorous coursework including the application of models like Black-Scholes, and my proactive approach will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team and proactively identify and mitigate potential trading risks in client portfolios.\r\n\r\nI am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my qualifications align with the needs of Lido Advisors. Thank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRoger Lin",

    "coverLetter" : "My name is Roger Lin, and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Master’s in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Quantitative Trading Analyst position at AlphaGrep. What draws me to this role is AlphaGrep’s unparalleled reputation for developing innovative, data-driven trading strategies, its focus on high-performance computing, and its culture of curiosity and collaboration. I am eager to contribute to your team’s efforts in building efficient trading systems while further refining my skills at the intersection of quantitative analysis, financial modeling, and technology.\n\nMy academic journey has been deeply focused on applying quantitative techniques to solve real-world financial challenges, a focus that aligns closely with the demands of AlphaGrep’s Quantitative Trading Analyst position. Most notably, I undertook a Fixed Income Asset Pricing project that required extracting real and nominal yield curves from bond market data to price Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury securities. This project involved cleaning and processing large datasets using Python, applying advanced statistical methods such as cubic spline interpolation and the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model, and implementing Monte Carlo simulations to stress-test hedging strategies under various interest rate scenarios. This hands-on experience enhanced my ability to design robust quantitative frameworks for pricing and risk evaluation—key skills I am excited to bring to the role at AlphaGrep.\n\nBuilding on this, I developed a dynamic asset allocation strategy as part of a Macro Finance project. Using historical data spanning 2000 to 2024, I implemented this strategy across multiple asset classes, showcasing my proficiency in data manipulation and statistical analysis using Python’s pandas and numpy libraries. To reduce dataset dimensionality and enhance performance, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and I used QSTrader, an open-source backtesting framework, to simulate the strategy’s performance under different economic scenarios. By incorporating transaction costs and slippage into the model, I evaluated its real-world feasibility. This project demonstrated my ability to combine theoretical financial models with practical programming skills to create scalable, object-oriented solutions, which I am eager to contribute to AlphaGrep’s trading systems.\n\nBeyond my academic projects, my professional experiences have been instrumental in preparing me for the fast-paced and analytical demands of quantitative trading. As a Research Assistant at the Becker Friedman Institute at UChicago, I analyzed the relationship between inflation regimes and returns across equities and bonds, with a particular focus on how macroeconomic trends influenced asset performance. This role required compiling and cleaning complex datasets, performing econometric analysis, and drafting comprehensive reports for both academic and policy audiences. It further solidified my ability to apply classroom theories to empirical research and interpret how market dynamics interact with macroeconomic indicators—insights I am confident will enrich my contributions to AlphaGrep’s research and trading strategy development.\n\nEarlier in my career, I served as a Business Analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, where I spearheaded a project for an event management software startup. By conducting in-depth market research, mapping competitive dynamics, and identifying growth opportunities, I created a long-term strategic plan that incorporated measurable targets and performance indicators. This experience deepened my understanding of strategic decision-making and instilled in me a sense of ownership over outcomes—values that align closely with AlphaGrep’s ethos. My background running my family’s small business also reinforced this mindset, teaching me to take accountability for decisions and continuously strive for improvement.\n\nAlphaGrep’s focus on leveraging sophisticated quantitative techniques to optimize trading strategies deeply resonates with my professional interests and skill set. My technical expertise includes programming in Python, R, and Stata; designing and testing quantitative models; and utilizing tools such as QSTrader and statistical methods like Monte Carlo simulations and PCA. I am particularly excited by the opportunity to collaborate with AlphaGrep’s team of engineers and market researchers, contributing to algorithmic trading systems that thrive in high-frequency environments. My passion for financial markets, combined with my technical acumen and problem-solving mindset, makes me confident in my ability to add value to your team.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my quantitative skills, programming expertise, and passion for innovation to AlphaGrep’s Chicago office. I am excited about the chance to collaborate with your team to design data-driven trading strategies and tackle some of the most complex challenges in global financial markets.\n\nBest regards,\nRoger Lin",

    "companyName" : "Balyasny Asset Management",
    "coverLetter" : "RE: Trading Product Analyst Position\n\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\nMy name is Roger Lin and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at UChicago's Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Trading Product Analyst position at Balyasny Asset Management (BAM). What drew me to this role specifically is BAM's unmatched reputation for investment excellence, its culture of collaboration and innovation, its focus on personal and professional growth, and the chance to contribute to the development of cutting-edge trading strategies and technologies.\n\nMy academic background in finance, economics, and public policy, combined with relevant professional experience, I believe, makes me an ideal candidate for this position. My passion for financial markets and their role in risk allocation has driven me to pursue a deep understanding of macroeconomic factors and key value drivers impacting firm returns. Through the MPP program's heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using Python, R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Moreover, through my coursework at the Booth School of Business, I have had the opportunity to deepen my financial valuation and equity research skills using datasources such as CapitalIQ Pro, Visible Alpha, and Bloomberg Terminal to perform company valuations and make data-driven investment recommendations.\n\nMy coursework has provided me with hands-on experience in applying advanced quantitative techniques to real-world financial problems, which aligns perfectly with the technical acumen required for the Trading Product Analyst role at BAM. In a fixed income asset pricing course, I undertook a project that involved extracting real and nominal yield curves from bond market data. This required me to clean and process large datasets using Python, applying sophisticated statistical methods such as cubic spline interpolation and the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model. I then leveraged these yield curves to price Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury securities, implementing complex pricing models in Python. The project culminated in designing sophisticated hedging strategies, where I utilized Monte Carlo simulations to stress-test the strategies under various interest rate scenarios. Building on this experience, in a Macro Finance course, I developed and tested a dynamic asset allocation strategy using historical data spanning from 2000 to 2024. This project showcased my proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using pandas and numpy libraries in Python. I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and determine the optimal asset allocation strategy across multiple asset classes. To evaluate the strategy's performance, I leveraged QSTrader, an open-source backtesting framework, where I implemented the strategy using object-oriented programming principles. This allowed me to simulate and assess the strategy's performance under various economic scenarios, incorporating transaction costs and slippage for a more realistic evaluation. Throughout both projects, I honed my skills in financial modeling, quantitative analysis, and programming, while also gaining practical experience in applying theoretical concepts to real-world financial challenges.\n\nMy professional journey has been instrumental in developing a sophisticated understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data-driven decision-making, which are crucial skills for the Trading Product Analyst role at BAM. As a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I spearheaded a transformative project for a local event management software startup. Our team conducted comprehensive market research to map out the competitive landscape, identified strategic market niches, and developed a long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. Our commitment to the client extended beyond the project's completion; we continued to track their progress and provide strategic advice, embodying a sense of ownership and accountability for our recommendations. This experience not only sharpened my analytical and strategic thinking skills but also taught me the importance of thinking like an owner—an ethos that aligns perfectly with BAM's culture of excellence and innovation. My earlier experience helping run my family's small business had already instilled in me this invaluable perspective. This approach, grounded in a deep sense of responsibility for outcomes and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement, has become a guiding principle in both my personal and professional life. It aligns perfectly with BAM's emphasis on collaboration and innovation at all levels, which I believe is a crucial factor driving the firm's continued success in a highly competitive industry.\n\nThis past summer, as a research assistant at UChicago's Becker Friedman Institute, I compiled and cleaned datasets, performed econometric analysis, and drafted memos. These tasks honed my ability to communicate complex data insights, a skill critical for collaborating with BAM's traders and developers to enhance trading system features. I studied the link between inflation and returns on various asset classes, and in particular, the historical correlation between equity and bond excess returns under different inflation regimes. This experience honed my ability to analyze large datasets, identify trends, and communicate complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences, skills that are directly applicable to collaborating with traders and developers at BAM. At BAM, I hope to leverage these skills to contribute to the development and implementation of cutting-edge trading system features, optimize execution processes, and enhance collaboration between business and technology teams.\n\nI am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with BAM's Global Execution Services team, where I can apply my technical skills, financial knowledge, and analytical abilities to drive strategic initiatives, optimize trading workflows, and contribute to the firm's continued success. During my time at Bainbridge Consulting, I facilitated client meetings to present our market analysis and strategic recommendations. I actively listened to their feedback, addressed concerns, and ensured alignment on the proposed solutions. This experience has prepared me to effectively lead sessions at BAM, demo workflow processes, and promote new feature rollouts.\n\nIn addition to my Python experience, I am proficient in MS Office and SQL, which I understand are key requirements for this role. While my understanding of the equities trading lifecycle is still developing, I am eager to deepen my knowledge in this area and believe my strong foundation in financial markets will allow me to quickly grasp these concepts.\n\nMy problem-solving skills have been honed through various projects, including a complex financial modeling task where I had to optimize a portfolio under multiple constraints. This required me to think creatively, apply advanced statistical techniques, and iterate on my approach based on feedback from professors and peers.\n\nIn terms of leadership, I have experience leading small teams on academic projects and organizing events for student organizations. These experiences have taught me how to motivate team members, delegate tasks effectively, and ensure project milestones are met on time.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe my academic background, technical skills, and professional experiences make me an excellent fit for the Trading Product Analyst role at BAM. I am eager to contribute to BAM's culture of excellence, collaboration, and innovation, and to play a role in maintaining and enhancing the firm's strong market position. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further and how I can contribute to BAM's continued success.\n\nBest regards,",

Jackson Blvd.\nChicago, IL 60604\nRE: Trading Associate Position (Chicago Office)\nTo Peak6 Recruitment Manager,\nMy name is Roger Lin and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Master’s in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance\nand Policy at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Trading\nAssociate position at Peak6’s Chicago Office. Through my conversations with two current traders at Peak6, Andrew\nHoagland and Alice Zhang, I was drawn to the firm’s collaborative culture and focus on developing traders through a\ncomprehensive training program paired with ongoing learning opportunities. This environment immediately appealed to\nme as one where I could grow professionally and personally.\nI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk across diverse investors.\nThis enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the\nmacroeconomic factors which influence them, and the pricing of different asset classes from stocks and bonds to\nderivatives such as options, swaps, and futures. Through the MPP’s heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore\ndeveloped a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in\nStatistical analysis using R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Such skills are readily\ntransferable to a context of trading. For instance, the emphasis on isolating the effect of a given policy treatment in a\npublic policy context mirrors the evaluation of fund managers’ performances adjusting for risk and correlation with the\nmarket.\nMy relevant finance and public policy coursework at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, encompass Corporate\nFinance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy,\nand Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, International Trade, Banking, and Capital Flows,\nand Statistics for Data Analysis. During the upcoming Winter quarter, I plan on taking two further graduate courses in\nFinancial Mathematics-Stochastic Calculus, and Quantitative Trading Strategies- to further deepen my understanding of\nthe mathematical underpinnings of derivatives pricing and trading.\nMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic\nplanning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped advise a local\nstartup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive\nlandscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth strategy.\nplan with measurable targets and performance indicators. In treating the client as a long-term growth partner, we were\ninvesting alongside them. We made sure that the proposals we made aligned with what was best for the company. My\nprior involvement in helping run my parents’ small business taught me this invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner\nearly on. This perspective, rooted in a sense of ownership and accountability for decision outcomes, has been a guiding\nprinciple in my approach to challenges and opportunities. Such a mindset, I believe, is crucial for success in the world of\ntrading, where integrity and accountability are vital to overcoming the agent-principal problem.\nThis past summer, I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-\nworld context as a research assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation\nregimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My\nresponsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning the dataset, running regressions, and interpreting the econometric\noutcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends in the data, and performing a literature review on\nprior works studying the link between inflation and asset returns for an upcoming paper. This experience was especially\nvaluable in allowing me to build upon the works of past contributors to the field of asset pricing research by exploring\nand testing new theories with real-world significance. The opportunity to participate in expanding our collective\nunderstanding of the field, in my capacity as a research assistant, was immensely gratifying and increased my appetite for\nfurther exploration.\nThe individual portfolio management system at Peak6 is the ideal platform from which to explore and continuously\nrefine my theories, with the market as the ultimate meritocracy. In an efficient market, information spreads quickly,\nbecoming reflected in asset prices in almost real time. Only those who discover new insights overlooked by the market\nare rewarded with alpha. It is in precisely such an environment that my boundless curiosity and relish for taking on new\nchallenges have proven to be my strongest assets.\nBest regards,\nRoger Lin",

    "coverLetter" : "Roger Lin\nChicago, IL | 646.354.1035 | linroger023@uchicago.edu\nRE: 2024 Quantitative Analyst Summer Intern\nDear Hiring Manager,\nMy name is Roger Lin and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a\nspecialization in Finance and Policy at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my strong\ninterest in the Quantitative Analyst position at Neuberger Berman’s New York Office. What attracts me to this role\nin particular is Neuberger Berman’s culture of collaboration, emphasis on personal and professional development,\nand the opportunity to explore different areas of Neuberger Berman’s operations. My academic background in\neconomics, finance, and public policy, combined with relevant professional experience, I believe, makes me an ideal\ncandidate for this position.\nI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk across\ndiverse investors. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial\nmarkets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the pricing of different asset classes from stocks\nand bonds to derivatives such as options, swaps, and futures. Through the MPP program’s heavy quantitative focus, I\nhave furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical\ncompetencies in statistical analysis using R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research.\nSuch skills are highly relevant to a career at Neuberger Berman, where the ability to identify and act on new\ninvestment opportunities is crucial.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a strong affinity for immersing myself\nin and excelling in learning new subjects, a quality which has enabled me to learn quickly and adapt to new\ncircumstances with ease. My relevant courses at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, encompass Corporate\nFinance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Microeconomics for Public\nPolicy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, International Trade, Banking, and\nCapital Flows, the Chinese Economy, and Statistics for Data Analysis I and II. Through these courses, I had the\nopportunity to learn about monetary policy from the former governor of the Central Bank of Paraguay (Professor\nCarlos Fernández Valdovinos), about how beliefs can lead to self-fulfilling crises that result in bank runs in the\nabsence of deposit guarantees from Professor Douglas Diamond, one of the recipients of the 2022 Nobel Prize in\nEconomic Sciences, and about the nuances of banking regulation for the former Illinois State Banking Director\n(Professor Chasse Rehwinkle). Most recently, I completed advanced courses in Financial Instruments and Fixed\nIncome Asset Pricing, which deepened my understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of the pricing and\ntrading various financial assets.\nMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis,\nstrategic planning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped\nadvise a local startup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out\nthe competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a\ncomprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. In treating the client as a\nlong-term growth partner we were investing alongside, we made sure that the proposals we made aligned were with\nwhat was best for the company. My prior involvement in helping run my parent's small business taught me this\ninvaluable lesson in thinking like an owner. early on. This perspective, rooted in a sense of ownership and\naccountability for decision outcomes, has been a guiding principle in my approach to life.\nThis past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset\nin a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link\nbetween inflation regimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond\nexcess returns. My responsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning datasets, running regressions and interpreting the\neconometric outcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends in the data, and performing\nliterature review on prior works studying the link between inflation and asset returns for a research project. This\nexperience was especially valuable in allowing me to build upon the works of past contributors to the field of asset\npricing research by exploring and testing new theories with real world significance. The opportunity to participate in\nexpanding our collective understanding of the field, in my capacity as a summer research assistant was immensely\ngratifying and increased my appetite for further probing. Neuberger Berman is the best place I can think of to\ncontinue my exploration of financial markets. My curiosity and eagerness to take on new challenges will be\ninvaluable assets in this role. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.\nBest regards,\nRoger Lin",

My academic background in finance, economics, and public policy, combined with relevant professional experience, I believe, makes me an ideal candidate for this position. I have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk between different market participants. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the key value drivers of an individual firm’s returns. Through the MPP program’s heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using Python, R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Moreover, through my coursework at the Booth School of Business, I have had the opportunity to deepen my financial valuation and equity research skills using datasources such as CapitalIQ Pro, Visible Alpha, and Bloomberg Terminal to perform company valuations and make data-driven investment recommendations. \n\n\tMy coursework has provided me with hands-on experience in applying advanced quantitative techniques to real-world financial problems.  In a fixed income asset pricing, I undertook a project that involved extracting real and nominal yield curves from bond market data. This required me to clean and process large datasets using Python, applying sophisticated statistical methods such as cubic spline interpolation and the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model. I then leveraged these yield curves to price Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury securities, implementing complex pricing models in Python. The project culminated in designing sophisticated hedging strategies, where I utilized Monte Carlo simulations to stress-test the strategies under various interest rate scenarios. Building on this experience, in a Macro Finance course, I developed and tested a dynamic asset allocation strategy using historical data spanning from 2000 to 2024. This project showcased my proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using pandas and numpy libraries in Python. I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and determine the optimal asset allocation strategy across multiple asset classes. To evaluate the strategy's performance, I leveraged QSTrader, an open-source backtesting framework, where I implemented the strategy using object-oriented programming principles. This allowed me to simulate and assess the strategy's performance under various economic scenarios, incorporating transaction costs and slippage for a more realistic evaluation. Throughout both projects, I honed my skills in financial modeling, quantitative analysis, and programming, while also gaining practical experience in applying theoretical concepts to real-world financial challenges.\n\n\tMy professional journey has been instrumental in developing a sophisticated understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data-driven decision-making.

    "coverLetter" : "\tRoger Lin\nChicago, IL | 646.354.1035 | linroger023@uchicago.edu\n\nRE: 2024 Investment Analyst (Buy Side)\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\n\tMy name is Roger Lin and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Buy Side Investment Analyst position at Guggenheim Partners’s New York Office. What attracts me to this role in particular is Guggenheim's entrepreneurial environment, where initiative, creativity, maturity, and enthusiasm for learning are highly valued. These qualities align perfectly with my own work ethic and approach to problem-solving. I am excited about the prospect of identifying potential investment opportunities, preparing compelling investment theses, and pitching my recommendations to the investment committee for consideration. My academic background in economics, finance, and public policy, combined with relevant professional experience, I believe, makes me an ideal candidate for this position.\n\n\tI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk across diverse investors. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets and the pricing of different asset classes from stocks and bonds to derivatives such as options, swaps, and futures. Through the MPP program’s heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using Python, Excel, R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Such skills are highly relevant to a career at Guggenheim Partners, where the ability to formulate investment theses backed up by data is crucial. \n\n\tThroughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a strong affinity for immersing myself in and excelling in learning new subjects, a quality which has enabled me to learn quickly and adapt to new circumstances with ease. My relevant courses at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, encompass Corporate Finance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, International Trade, Banking, and Capital Flows, the Chinese Economy, and Statistics for Data Analysis I and II. Most recently, I completed advanced courses in Financial Instruments and Fixed Income Asset Pricing, which deepened my understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of the pricing and trading of various financial assets. \n\n\tMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped advise a local startup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. In treating the client as a long-term growth partner we were investing alongside, we made sure that the proposals we made aligned were with what was best for the company. My past experience in helping run my parent's small business taught me an invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner. This perspective, rooted in a sense of ownership and accountability for decision outcomes, has been a guiding principle in my approach to life.\n\n\tThis past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation regimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My responsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning datasets, running regressions and interpreting the econometric outcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends in the data, and performing literature review on prior works studying the link between inflation and asset returns for a research project. This experience was especially valuable in allowing me to build upon the works of past contributors to the field of asset pricing research by exploring and testing new theories with real world significance. Guggenheim Partners is the best place I can think of to continue my exploration of financial markets. My curiosity and eagerness to take on new challenges will be invaluable assets in this role. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further. \n\nBest regards, \nRoger Lin",

    "coverLetter" : "Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the 2025 Citadel Associate Program. As a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy, I am particularly drawn to Citadel's reputation for excellence in investing, its data-driven approach, and its commitment to improving market structure and policy.\nMy academic journey has been driven by a deep fascination with financial markets and their role in efficient risk allocation. Through the rigorous quantitative training at Harris and Booth, I've developed a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and financial modeling. I've become proficient in Python, R, and Stata, applying these tools to complex financial analyses, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making. My coursework has included Advanced Microeconomics for Public Policy, Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, and International Trade, Banking, and Capital Markets, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of finance and economics.\n\nAt Booth, I've had the opportunity to enhance my equity research skills using industry-standard tools like CapitalIQ Pro, Visible Alpha, and Bloomberg Terminal. This hands-on experience has sharpened my ability to perform comprehensive company valuations, conduct thorough due diligence, and make data-driven investment recommendations. I've developed a keen eye for identifying key value drivers, understanding how macroeconomic factors influence individual firm performance, and spotting market inefficiencies that could be exploited for alpha generation.\n\nMy professional experience as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting provided valuable insights into strategic planning and competitive analysis. Working with a startup in the event management software space, I led efforts to map the competitive landscape, identify strategic market niches, and develop a comprehensive growth plan. This experience honed my ability to think critically about business models, market positioning, and long-term value creation – skills that I believe are essential for successful equity investing.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, my summer research assistantship at UChicago's Becker Friedman Institute allowed me to apply my quantitative skills to real-world financial challenges. I conducted an in-depth study on the relationship between inflation regimes and returns across various asset classes, focusing on the historical correlation between equity and bond excess returns. This project involved compiling and cleaning over 50 years of historical data on inflation, stock market valuations, Treasury yields, and inflation expectations. I used advanced time series analysis techniques, including GARCH models and regime-switching models, to capture the dynamic relationship between inflation and asset returns. My research also involved extracting inflation expectations from swaps market data and decomposing bond returns to isolate the inflation risk premium.\n\nThis experience not only enhanced my econometric analysis skills but also deepened my understanding of how macroeconomic trends impact investment returns across different market environments. It demonstrated my ability to synthesize complex financial data, perform rigorous statistical analyses, and communicate findings effectively to both academic and policy audiences.\n\nWhat sets me apart is my interdisciplinary background in public policy and finance. This unique perspective aligns well with Citadel's efforts in publishing public policy memos on market structure and design, as well as reform recommendations. My coursework in Bank Regulation and Management, taught by the former Illinois State Banking Director, has given me insights into the regulatory landscape of financial markets. I've studied the nuances of banking regulation and its impact on market dynamics, which I believe could be valuable in understanding and anticipating regulatory changes that might affect investment strategies.\n\nMoreover, my training in public policy has equipped me with the skills to analyze and interpret policy changes and their potential market impacts. This skillset could be particularly useful in contributing to Citadel's efforts to improve market structure and advocate for beneficial reforms. I'm excited about the possibility of applying this knowledge to help Citadel navigate complex regulatory environments and potentially contribute to the firm's policy-related initiatives.\nI am deeply committed to continuous learning and improvement, a value I understand is central to Citadel's culture. My experience helping run my family's small business instilled in me a strong sense of ownership and accountability. I approach every task with an owner's mindset, consistently seeking ways to refine processes and drive better outcomes.\n\nI am particularly drawn to Citadel's scientific, data-driven approach to investing. Your firm's emphasis on rigorous research, empirical testing, and continuous refinement of investment strategies resonates deeply with my own methodical approach to financial analysis. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to and learning from Citadel's cutting-edge research initiatives, whether it's developing new alpha signals, refining risk models, or exploring alternative data sources for investment insights.\nIn conclusion, I am committed to leveraging my unique blend of skills in finance, public policy, and quantitative analysis to contribute to Citadel's continued success. I am excited by the opportunity to work alongside talented professionals, to be intellectually challenged, and to continuously refine my investment acumen in an environment that rewards meritocracy and excellence.\nI look forward to the opportunity to discuss in greater detail how my background, skills, and aspirations align with Citadel's mission and values. Thank you for your consideration.\n\nBest regards,\nRoger Lin",

We manage capital on behalf of many of the world’s preeminent private, public and nonprofit institutions. We seek the highest and best use of investor capital in order to deliver market leading results and contribute to broader economic growth. For over 30 years, Citadel has cultivated a culture of learning and collaboration among some of the most talented and accomplished investment professionals, researchers and engineers in the world. Our colleagues are empowered to test their ideas and develop commercial solutions that accelerate their growth and drive real impact.\nWhat makes someone successful as a quantitative researcher?\n\nApplying a curious and commercial mindset is crucial to success. Whether you are analyzing asset behavior under different circumstances, identifying risk factors or deciphering patterns from vast datasets, it’s essential to demonstrate these qualities:\nOwnership\nWe encourage initiative. Those who take on responsibility and accountability for projects are supported and rewarded and grow the fastest.\nCreativity\nThe problems we take on generally don’t have simple solutions. You will be exposed to real-world problems and must innovate and iterate from multiple angles with passion and persistence. We are excited by the opportunity to test our ideas—and keep doing so until we find a solution.\nAmbition and Resilience\nYou should have an insatiable drive to seek out problems and identify their solutions. There is no shortage of interesting issues to work on, and the most successful quants are true self-starters who are eager to take on new challenges and solve difficult challenges.\nOur work is challenging. People who thrive here embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and keep pushing forward. You need to be able to share strong rationales for the solutions you propose and must be comfortable pivoting.\nTechnical proficiency\nExcellence is our baseline. Expertise in the financial markets is not necessarily required on Day One; we’ll teach you. We want talented researchers who place a high degree of importance on precision, want to learn, can master new skills and continue to raise the bar together.\nWhat skills are the most important in quantitative research careers?\n\nMath and Statistics\nIt’s vital to have these foundational skills, since you’ll be spending a lot of time modeling and forecasting, using statistics as a launching point. We can teach you everything you need to know about finance, but you should already have a robust statistical intuition.\nEngineering and Coding\nCoding can be very useful in quantitative roles. Familiarity with computer science will help you learn quickly and use our proprietary tools independently.\nWorking with Data\nPrior experience working with data will enhance your ability to understand its real-world applications and model that information effectively. Many of your colleagues will come from non-computer science backgrounds like chemistry or physics, where they utilized these skills. This is invaluable as we develop new approaches to identify market signals.\nApplied Research\nA deep understanding of conducting and applying research is critical. Markets change daily and positions may need to be kept open for an extended period. To that end, experience working on long-term research projects is extremely beneficial, but learning on the job is equally effective.\nWhat is the difference in the roles quantitative researchers play in fundamental and quantitative strategies?\n\nOur asset management business includes: fundamental and quantitative strategies. Both approaches require top research talent – the main difference lies in how the models developed by our researchers are used to make investment decisions.\nIn our fundamental businesses, quants develop models that are used by our investment and trading professional to make decisions.\nIn Global Quantitative Strategies, quants work closely with engineers to build models that trade systematically.\nWhat sets Citadel apart in the financial industry?\n\nWe only hire extraordinary talent. Our colleagues are extremely smart, driven individuals focused on achieving results. The opportunity for learning and growth is unrivaled.\nSuccess is shared. We work alongside our peers and mentors to develop ideas together. When quants present their work to their research team, they receive valuable academic-style feedback. Teams pressure-test ideas from all angles, asking nuanced questions and challenging specific elements to ensure the concept is as strong as possible.\nWe can also make an impact faster here than just about anywhere else. Some firms keep research and production separate. Here, we combine the two, making us faster and more agile. A new project might go from ideation, to deployment, to the investment and trading teams within an hour.\nWhat does a career path in quantitative research look like?\n\nWhen you start, you will join a specialized team and have the opportunity to quickly learn and master new skills. Your success depends on your ability to apply yourself in a collaborative environment, one in which you can turn your ideas into measurable business impact.\nCitadel provides the resources and mentors you need to be successful. There are countless opportunities to raise your hand with ideas and receive the tools to translate those lightbulb moments into reality. Flawless execution of these proposals will only lead to more opportunities to explore your solutions and demonstrate their value.\nAs you progress, you can take control of core strategies, new ideas and features. There is a real opportunity to own the entire pipeline—from generating an idea, to determining its viability, to implementing code, and finally, to deploying the solution for the business.\nA true meritocracy, we foster an environment where people who demonstrate initiative and capability keep both their projects and careers accelerating.\nWhat can you expect to learn as a quantitative researcher?\n\nYou will have the opportunity to hone your research expertise, improve your technical skills and develop your intuition.\nWhen you work in the financial markets, you won’t wait weeks or months to see if you were right or if your hypothesis held. Projects are put into production and live trading. The markets give you real-time feedback, which helps you iterate and learn faster.\nSince attention to detail is key, our quants continually sharpen their coding skills and become more confident in their ability to consistently deliver stable and production-ready code.\nOur quants also develop a strong intuition for identifying what is important when they are testing and researching projects. Sometimes a small anomaly can lead to a large discovery, and they learn to embrace that way of thinking as they develop their intuition.\nWhat is the firm’s culture like for quantitative researchers?\n\nCollaboration is at the heart of our culture. We learn not only from our research, but from one another. Everyone focuses on new ways to contribute and add value.\nWe encourage the dynamic, experimental and autonomous approach familiar in many leading tech startups but provide the supportive framework of an established financial firm. This means you can benefit from mobility, communication, resources and top-tier benefits.\nOur researchers come from a variety of backgrounds and thrive because they bring their unique perspectives and research specialties to bear. While each quant is expected to be a subject matter expert in a particular vertical, sharing and challenging ideas is necessary develop and deliver optimal solutions. Everyone continually thinks about how they can add value and what they can do to contribute.\nFinally, we are empowered to contribute in meaningful ways. We’re motivated to do more than we ever thought possible – and are recognized for our accomplishments.\n\n\nWhat Defines\nStrong Candidates\n* BS\/MS\/PhD in mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science or another highly quantitative field\n* Strong knowledge of probability and statistics\n* Experience performing data analysis and building predictive models using data Intellectual curiosity\n* Passion for problem solving\n* Programming experience\n* Motivation to learn\nInvesting\nArmed with fundamental research and fueled by endless curiosity, investment professionals apply their skills across a range of asset classes and global markets.\n\n\nYour Role\nFind an insight.

    "notes" : "RE: Equities – Citadel Associate Program – Full Time Program 2025 (US)\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\n\tMy name is Roger Lin and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the 2025 Citadel Associate Program at Citadel.\n\nWhat attracts me to this role in particular is Citadel’s unparalleled reputation for investing\nculture of ownership, emphasis on personal and professional development, and the opportunity to work and learn alongside the most brilliant investment team on the planet. My academic background in economics, finance, and public policy, combined with relevant professional experience, I believe, makes me an ideal candidate for this position.\n\n\tI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk between different market participants. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the key value drivers of an individual firm’s returns.\n\n Through the MPP program’s heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using Python, R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Moreover, through my coursework at the Booth School of Business, I have had the opportunity to deepen my financial valuation and equity research skills using datasources such as CapitalIQ Pro, Visible Alpha, and Bloomberg Terminal to perform company valuations and make data-driven investment recommendations.\n\n\tMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped advise a local startup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. My team and I continued to liaise with the company long after the project’s completion to track their progress and to advise on any strategic adjustments to the business plan. In treating the firm as a long-term growth partner, each member of our team took accountability for the plan we presented, and sought to continuously learn and improve alongside our client. My past experience of helping run my parent's small business taught me this invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner early on. This perspective, rooted in a sense of accountability for decision outcomes and desire to continuously improve and learn, has been a guiding principle in my approach to life and work. Citadel’s own ethos of ownership at all levels of the firm, I believe, is a crucial factor driving its continued outperformance in a highly competitive industry.\n[elaborate more on Citadel’s culture of ownership and how it aligns with your own personal values.]\n\n\tThis past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation and returns on various asset classes, and in particular, the historical correlation between equity and bond excess returns under different inflation regimes. My responsibilities entailed performing literature review, compiling and cleaning datasets, performing econometric analysis and interpreting the results, and drafting memos highlighting the main findings of the study for an academic and public policy audience. This experience was particularly gratifying in allowing me to apply theories learned in the classroom to the real world and to study empirically how macroeconomic trends affected investment returns. At Citadel, I hope to continue my exploration of financial markets in the real world, and to test and refine my theories in the meritocracy of the market. [Discuss Citadel’s scientific and data backed approach to investing, and how research is a major part of their investment strategy. Link this to your own experiences and skillsets.] My curiosity and eagerness to take on new challenges will be invaluable assets in this role. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.\n\nBest regards, \nRoger Lin",

I am a second year candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, where my studies have focused on the confluence of finance and policy. My interest in this role stems from a desire to utilize my skills and knowledge to help further the IFC’s mission of bridging development capital and the private sector to catalyze transformative change in developing countries. As an investment analyst, I hope to play a role in the organization’s mission by helping identify and facilitate the allocation of capital towards its most efficient ends. \n\n\tAt the University of Chicago, I had the opportunity to meet with and study alongside brilliant minds from all across the world, all sharing a commitment to the humanistic endeavor of improving lives through development. I gained a wealth of knowledge and understanding learning from their diverse backgrounds and experiences in government agencies and NGOs. Through my courses, I had the opportunity to learn from those who were in positions of power-from former heads of Central Banks, to former ministers of Finance, to asset managers of sovereign wealth funds, and the challenges their positions entailed, and the decisions they faced. \n\n\tMy relevant finance and public policy coursework at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, encompass Corporate Finance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, International Trade, Banking, and Capital Flows, and Statistics for Data Analysis. From my public policy studies, I have gained an intuitive grasp of how individuals, bureaucracies, and firms make decisions in the face of imperfect information, and how game theory can be used to model the likely outcomes of policy initiatives.  I have also become thoroughly familiar with the various factors that impact investment performance and drive asset allocation decisions. The quantitative backbone of my masters program has strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Through my coursework, I have gained practical hands on experience in analyzing and interpreting complex financial data, using financial models to evaluate investment strategies, and working with statistical software such as State and R for data analysis. \n\n\tBeyond my academic experience, I have also had opportunities to develop and employ my skills in financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis in a professional setting. As a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I worked alongside a team of consultants in advising a local startup offering event management software. We worked alongside them to map out the competitive landscape they faced, helping them to identify a niche in the market they could fill, and to build a long term growth plan to expand their business, with yearly targets to reach and various performance indicators to track their progress. \nOver the past summer, I engaged on an independent research effort on identifying and measuring various factors of equity return outperformance, working with large datasets of historical share prices, to identify changing trends in the autocorrelation of stock prices, and comparing the performances of different strategies. As one of our tests, we compared the relative performance of ESG screened funds with a benchmark S&P 500 index, finding that there was no systematic outperformance of ESG funds over the broader market index. \n\n\tMoreover, in my capacity as editor-in-chief and co-founder of the Triton Business Review, I have had the opportunity to critically engage with financial markets and economic policy on a global scale. Working alongside a group of similarly passionate writers to publish monthly articles on a range of global issues, I shared my analysis of the second order effects of major developments, and helped many in my team to gain the confidence to share their views as well. These experiences have not only honed my written and verbal communication skills, but have also deepened my understanding of the multifaceted role of finance in driving economic prosperity.\nGiven my robust academic training, professional experiences, and passion for development, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to your team. I appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to the possibility of contributing to your mission.\n\n\nSincerely,\nRoger Lin \nHarris MPP\nlinroger023@uchicago.edu",

As a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with an focus on Finance and Policy at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy expecting to graduate in June 2024, I am confident that my academic background, quantitative and analytical skills, and policy expertise make me an ideal candidate for this role.\n \nMy background in public policy has strengthened my ability to analyze the potential impacts of economic and political events on financial markets, both in the near-term and long-term. I have developed an intuitive understanding of decision-making under uncertainty that is applicable to governments, corporations, and individuals. Through my training in rigorous analysis and objective evaluation of policy decisions and their outcomes, I have learned that I am well suited for results-oriented roles where the quality of one's thinking can be quantified in terms of profits and losses.\n \nRelevant coursework I have completed at Harris and at UChicago Booth School of Business include Corporate Finance, Applied Financial Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, and Financial Markets and Institutions. Through these classes, I have gained fluency in the myriad factors that impact investment performance and value creation levers within firms. The quantitative backbone of my masters program has strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research.\n \nPrior to beginning graduate school, I completed two internships at Bainbridge Consulting as a business analyst intern, and at PwC, as an Assurance Financial Markets & Real Estate intern. In both these roles, I gained crucial experience helping clients solve problems and derive insights through financial modelling and data analysis. Whilst interning at Bainbridge Consulting, my team collaborated closely with a local startup in identifying a competitive niche for their software service and devising a pricing strategy based on market research of competitors and surveys of target consumers.\n \n​This past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation regimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My responsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning datasets, running regressions and interpreting the econometric outcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends in the data, and performing literature review on prior works studying the link between inflation and asset returns for a research project. This experience was especially valuable in allowing me to build upon the works of past contributors to the field of asset pricing research by exploring and testing new theories with real world significance. The opportunity to participate in expanding our collective understanding of the field, in my capacity as a summer research assistant was immensely gratifying and increased my appetite for further probing.\n \nJP Morgan’s prominence as a financial leader along with its commitment to serving the communities where it operates resonates with me as a student of public policy aligned with the firm's public facing ethos. The firm's outsized role in spearheading private sector engagement on societal and global challenges brings new meaning to the \"financial services\" industry, where financial institutions have separated themselves from the major issues facing society. Ultimately, I believe my academic background, experience in finance, and quantitative skillset, make me a strong candidate for the position at your firm. Please find my resume attached; I look forward to discussing my interests and qualifications further. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application.\n \nKind Regards,\n\nRoger Lin",

My studies have focused on the confluence of finance and policy, and the interplay of politics and the economy, with relevant coursework including Corporate Finance, Applied Financial Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking. These courses have given me a familiarity with the myriad factors influencing investment performance, as well as an intimate understanding of how financial institutions and corporations function on a micro level to generate value. The MPP program’s focus on quantitative rigor has also allowed me to develop many technical competencies including statistical analysis, research, data-driven decision making, strategic thinking, and project evaluation. \n\nPolicy analysis and investment evaluation share many common principles and approaches, among which are the use of cost-benefit calculations and an objective data-driven approach to weighing decisions, the imperative to make decisions without perfect information and manage risk by preparing for contingencies.

My responsibilities entailed reading the client’s financial statements and creating financial models forecasting the strategy’s impact on the firm’s operations based on reasonable assumptions, and conducting scenario and sensitivity analysis to assess performance under different outcomes. These findings were incorporated into the project deliverable, which provided a comprehensive view of the client’s market positioning, outlined their core competencies and competitive advantage, and suggested a strategy for meeting their growth objective based on our models. Throughout the 8 weeks of the project, I learned much about the essential attributes of effective teamwork and leadership, which entails treating all members as equals and valuing their input. This experience also gave me a deeper appreciation for the importance of good judgment in producing accurate and reliable financial models, and how data analysis can be leveraged to improve decision-making and outcomes.\n\nUltimately, I believe my academic background, experience in finance, and quantitative skillset, make me a strong candidate for the position of M&A Intern at your firm.

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Private Equity Valuations & Analytics Analyst position at Blackstone’s New York office. What truly sets Blackstone apart, in my view, is the firm's culture of excellence, and the collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment it fosters.  I am particularly drawn to Blackstone's emphasis on teamwork and professional development, as these values closely align with my own work ethic and desire to learn from the best.\n\nAs someone who is passionate about finance and driven by challenges, I am drawn to the complex nature of the work at Blackstone. The opportunity to work in some on the most complex and difficult deals is exactly the kind of challenge I am looking for in my career. I am eager to apply my skills in financial modeling, data analysis, and quantitative reasoning to help the team evaluate and execute on these transactions.\n\nMoreover, I am excited by the prospect of working on deals that have a real-world impact. Blackstone's portfolio companies span a wide range of industries, from healthcare and technology to energy and real estate. The opportunity to be part of transactions that shape these industries and drive economic growth is incredibly meaningful to me. I am motivated by the idea of contributing to something larger than myself and making a positive impact on the world through my work.\n\nThroughout my academic and professional experiences, I have consistently sought out opportunities to push myself outside of my comfort zone and tackle new challenges head-on. As a research assistant at the Becker Friedman Institute, for example, I dove into the complex world of asset pricing, studying the link between inflation regimes and equity returns. Similarly, my experience as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting allowed me to work on a challenging project advising a startup on their long-term growth strategy. These experiences have taught me the importance of thinking creatively, working collaboratively, and adapting to new challenges – skills that I believe will serve me well in the fast-paced and dynamic environment at Blackstone.\n\nI am confident that the challenging and rewarding nature of the work at Blackstone, combined with the opportunity to learn from some of the brightest minds in the industry, would push me to grow both personally and professionally. I am excited by the prospect of being part of a team that is constantly striving to innovate and deliver exceptional results. \n\nThank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.\n\nBest regards, \nRoger Lin",

    "coverLetter" : "\tRoger Lin\nChicago, IL | 646.354.1035 | linroger023@uchicago.edu\n\nRE: Neuberger Berman Fixed Income Rotational Program Analyst\nDear Hiring Manager\n\tMy name is Roger Lin and I am currently a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy with a specialization in Finance and Policy at UChicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fixed Income Rotational Program Analyst position at Neuberger Berman’s Chicago Office. What attracts me to this role in particular is Neuberger Berman’s culture of collaboration, emphasis on personal and professional development, and the opportunity to gain exposure to different areas of the fixed income market. My academic background in economics, finance, and public policy, combined with relevant professional experience, I believe, makes me an ideal candidate for this position.\n\tI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk across diverse investors. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the pricing of different asset classes from stocks and bonds to derivatives such as options, swaps, and futures. Through the MPP program’s heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Such skills are highly relevant to a career at Neuberger Berman, where the ability to identify and act on new investment opportunities is crucial. \n\tThroughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a strong affinity for immersing myself in and excelling in learning new subjects, a quality which has enabled me to learn quickly and adapt to new circumstances with ease. My relevant courses at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, encompass Corporate Finance, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, International Trade, Banking, and Capital Flows, the Chinese Economy, and Statistics for Data Analysis I and II. Through these courses, I had the opportunity to learn about monetary policy from the former governor of the Central Bank of Paraguay (Professor Carlos Fernández Valdovinos), about how beliefs can lead to self-fulfilling crises that result in bank runs in the absence of deposit guarantees from Professor Douglas Diamond, one of the recipients of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, and about the nuances of banking regulation for the former Illinois State Banking Director (Professor Chasse Rehwinkle). Most recently, I completed advanced courses in Financial Instruments and Fixed Income Asset Pricing, which deepened my understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of the pricing and trading various financial assets. \n\tMy professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped advise a local startup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. In treating the client as a long-term growth partner we were investing alongside, we made sure that the proposals we made aligned were with what was best for the company. My prior involvement in helping run my parent's small business taught me this invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner. early on. This perspective, rooted in a sense of ownership and accountability for decision outcomes, has been a guiding principle in my approach to life.\n\n\tThis past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago’s Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation regimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My responsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning datasets, running regressions and interpreting the econometric outcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends in the data, and performing literature review on prior works studying the link between inflation and asset returns for a research project. This experience was especially valuable in allowing me to build upon the works of past contributors to the field of asset pricing research by exploring and testing new theories with real world significance. The opportunity to participate in expanding our collective understanding of the field, in my capacity as a summer research assistant was immensely gratifying and increased my appetite for further probing. Neuberger Berman is the best place I can think of to continue my exploration of financial markets. My curiosity and eagerness to take on new challenges will be invaluable assets in this role. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further. \n\nBest regards, \nRoger Lin",

I am writing to express my strong interest in the M&A Capital Markets Analyst position at Goldman Sach’s New York Office. I am drawn to Goldman Sachs due to its, I was drawn to the firm's collaborative culture and focus on developing traders through a comprehensive training program paired with ongoing learning opportunities. This environment immediately appealed to me as one where I could grow professionally and personally. \n\nI have long been fascinated by financial markets, especially their role in efficiently allocating risk across diverse investors. This enduring curiosity has led me to seek out opportunities to deepen my knowledge of financial markets, the macroeconomic factors which influence them, and the pricing of different asset classes from stocks and bonds to derivatives such as options, swaps, and futures. Through the MPP’s heavy quantitative focus, I have furthermore developed a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, as well as strengthened my technical competencies in statistical analysis using R and Stata, data-driven decision making, financial modeling, and research. Such skills are readily transferable to a context of capital markets, where investors need to process information quickly and understand the second and third order consequences of recent events. \n\nI am drawn to M&A advisory because it sits at the intersection of finance, business strategy, and market analysis – three domains I am deeply passionate about. Having studied both public policy and business, I understand how financial engineering solutions can help firms hedge risks and operate more efficiently. M&A allows me to utilize my interdisciplinary policy, economic, strategic planning, and statistical analysis abilities to fulfill a direct business need – structuring the most advantageous deals for clients.\n\nMy relevant finance and public policy coursework at Harris, and at the Booth School of Business, encompass Corporate Finance, Financial Instruments, Financial Investments for Public Policy, Bank Regulation and Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions, International Trade, Banking, and Capital Flows, and Statistics for Data Analysis. My professional experience has moreover equipped me with a nuanced understanding of financial analysis, strategic planning, and data analysis. During my tenure as a business analyst at Bainbridge Consulting, I helped advise a local startup offering event management software. Collaborating closely with the startup, we mapped out the competitive landscape using market research, identified a strategic market niche, and formulated a comprehensive long-term growth plan with measurable targets and performance indicators. In treating the client as a long-term growth partner we were investing alongside, we made sure that the proposals we made aligned were with what was best for the company. My prior involvement in helping run my parent's small business taught me this invaluable lesson in thinking like an owner. early on. This perspective, rooted in a sense of ownership and accountability for decision outcomes, has been a guiding principle in my approach to challenges and opportunities. Such a mindset, I believe, is crucial for success in the world of trading, where integrity and accountability are vital to overcoming the agent-principal problem.\n\nThis past summer I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge of financial markets and quantitative skillset in a real-world context as a research assistant at UChicago’s  Becker Friedman Institute, where I studied the link between inflation regimes and equity returns by looking at the historical correlations between equity and bond excess returns. My responsibilities entailed compiling and cleaning the dataset, running regressions and interpreting the econometric outcomes, preparing data visualizations to highlight important trends in the data, and performing literature review on prior works studying the link between inflation and asset returns for an upcoming paper. This experience was especially valuable in understanding how changes in the macroeconomy impact the decision making of firms on a microeconomic level. \n\nIn closing, I believe I possess the ideal blend of skills, experience and motivation to excel as an M&A Capital Markets Analyst at Goldman Sachs. My quantitative abilities, financial analysis competence and strategic perspective equip me to provide effective solutions tailored to clients’ objectives. My diligence, capacity to rapidly synthesize complex information, and creative thinking will enable me to meet the demands of this fast-paced role. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further. Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions. Thank you and have a wonderful day.\n\nBest regards, \n\nRoger Lin",

Through these courses, I had the opportunity to learn about monetary policy from the former governor of the Central Bank of Paraguay(Professor Carlos Fernández Valdovinos), about how beliefs can lead to self-fulfilling crises that result in bank runs in the absence of deposit guarantees from Professor Douglas Diamond, one of the recipients of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, and about the nuances of banking regulation for the former Illinois State Banking Director (Professor Chasse Rehwinkle).

    "coverLetter" : "March 23rd, 2023\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in the Summer Analyst position at Rothschild & Co.'s Chicago office. As a candidate pursuing a Masters in Public Policy at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, expecting to graduate in June 2024, I am confident that my academic background, quantitative and analytical skills, and policy expertise make me an ideal candidate for this role.\n\nMy studies have focused on the confluence of finance and policy and the interplay of politics and the economy, with relevant coursework including Corporate Finance, Applied Financial Management, Microeconomics for Public Policy, and Macroeconomic Policymaking. These courses have given me a familiarity with the myriad factors influencing investment performance, as well as an intimate understanding of how financial institutions and corporations function to generate value. The MPP program’s focus on quantitative rigor has also allowed me to develop many technical competencies, including statistical analysis, research, data-driven decision-making, strategic thinking, and project evaluation.\n\nPolicy analysis and investment evaluation share common principles and approaches, including the use of cost-benefit calculations, an objective data-driven approach to weighing decisions, and the imperative to make decisions without perfect information and manage risk by preparing for contingencies. Beyond these similarities, my background in public policy also provides me with an intuitive grasp of the reflexive dynamic between markets and the government, and a unique perspective that broadens the diversity of opinions to improve the decision-making process.\n\nAs a business analyst intern at Bainbridge Consulting, I deepened my understanding of business development and valuation, applying these concepts to craft a business strategy as a consultant to an event-planning software startup seeking to grow their operations and reach new customers. Using market research and surveys of target consumers, my team helped the client identify their competitive niche and formulate a business plan for achieving their growth targets. My responsibilities entailed reading the client’s financial statements, creating financial models forecasting the strategy’s impact on the firm’s operations (based on certain assumptions), and conducting scenario and sensitivity analyses to assess performance under different outcomes. These findings were incorporated into the project deliverable, which provided a comprehensive view of the client’s market positioning, outlined their core competencies and competitive advantage, and suggested a strategy for meeting their growth objective based on our models. Throughout the eight weeks of the project, I learned much about the essential attributes of effective leadership and teamwork, which often entails treating all members as equals and valuing their input.\n\nThis experience also gave me a deeper appreciation for the nuances of financial modeling, including how data analysis can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of cash flow projections, as well as the importance of scenario planning in helping firms prepare for the unexpected and mitigate risk. At Rothschild & Co., I hope to continue learning and grow both personally and professionally in a rigorous and meritocratic environment where profits and losses are tied to the quality of one’s work.\n\nI also had the opportunity to develop these skills in a professional environment as a Risk and Financial Advisory Intern at Deloitte’s San Diego office, working with an international bank on handling transactions. The client project entailed conducting due diligence checks on the bank’s counterparties, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, and assessing tax obligations in various jurisdictions. My responsibilities included building models assessing foreign currency risk to guide the client’s loan decisions and conducting scenario analyses for the bank’s balance sheets under different contingencies. This experience gave me a close-up look at how financial institutions conduct transactions and manage risk, experience with modeling, scenario analysis, and valuations, and experience working effectively in a team to meet project milestones.\n\nA past internship as a Risk and Financial Advisory Analyst at Deloitte’s San Diego office during my penultimate year of university also gave me early exposure to different parts of the financial system and allowed me to gain real-world experience working effectively in a team environment to solve a client’s problem. My responsibilities included performing due diligence checks on high-risk clients for an international bank, helping them mitigate risk, and helping ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws across multiple jurisdictions. I also built financial models in Excel to help the client weigh strategic decisions, taking care to note the potential risks of each option and how best to mitigate them. The client presentation my team and I put together helped inform the bank’s decision, laying out forecasts under different scenarios of each choice through financial models we built in Excel and taking care to note the potential risks attendant with each decision and how best to mitigate them. This experience gave me a close-up look at how financial institutions conduct transactions and manage risk, experience with modeling, scenario analysis, and valuations, and experience working collaboratively to tackle complex problems by breaking them into component parts and delegating tasks effectively to ensure smooth progress throughout the project.\n\nMy strengths in the fields of both finance and policy give me a unique perspective and an intuitive grasp of their reflexive influences on each other, which will enable me to excel in a position where the ability to translate both quantitative and qualitative inputs into useful information is of crucial importance. I am currently completing the first year of my two-year MPP Program at UChicago, where my studies have focused on the confluence of finance and public policy and how private firms, such as financial institutions, have evolved to meet the needs of today’s world and to increase their resilience to the risks of the future. Through courses in Corporate Finance, Applied Financial Management, and Macroeconomic Policymaking, I gained a wide-ranging mastery of the broad factors influencing the performance of investments, as well as an intimate understanding of how financial institutions and corporations function on a micro level to create value. Through the program’s heavy quantitative focus, I have acquired a strong foundation in statistical analysis, research, data-driven decision-making, strategic planning, financial analysis and valuation, as well as expertise in policy matters. My strengths in both the financial and policy aspects make me a strong candidate, I believe, for a position where projecting future investment returns amidst uncertainty is the bread and butter of the firm’s business.\n\nWhile at Harris, I was also able to participate in the International Strategic Crisis Negotiation Exercise, leading the Indonesian delegation in negotiations over disputed claims in the South China Sea. This experience strengthened my strategic thinking skills and gave me greater insight into the means by which one’s desired end goals can be attained in negotiations with parties with diametrically opposed positions, which often involves understanding the other side’s desired end goals and acceptable compromises and modeling their behavior to predict their most likely positions and strategies. My responsibilities as team leader involved coordinating meetings, delegating tasks, and devising negotiation strategies. Furthermore, as team leader, I gained valuable experience in achieving one’s desired outcomes in negotiations with parties with seemingly intractable differences — assets that I believe are important to a business where policy decisions and unforeseen risks are a part of everyday life.\n\nFurthermore, a strong understanding of the policymaking process and the strategic interactions of different groups is of increasing importance as financial institutions like your own take on greater responsibility for the environments in which they operate and give more attention to the wide range of stakeholders impacted by their operations. Among the many technical competencies I developed through the quantitatively focused MPP program are statistical analysis, research, data-driven decision-making, strategic thinking, and project evaluation. I hope to put these skills to good use as an analyst at Rothschild & Co., where my familiarity with the worlds of both finance and policy gives me a unique perspective that I believe will enable me to excel.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nRoger Lin\n\n",

    "coverLetter" : "My introduction to the world of public policy came as a child growing up in a China amidst an “economic miracle” which profoundly transformed society and lifted hundreds of millions from poverty and into a growing middle class. This experience proved to me that poverty is not unescapable,  and that like my own nations, today’s developing nations could escape poverty and attain a measure of prosperity through  the right policies and implementation. The importance of development matter more than just an increase in per-capita income, it restores human dignity deprived them by poverty, provides a level of economic security that allows them to undertake long-term investments in education and planning for the future, opens more opportunities available to them, and allows them to engage in the lives they envision for themselves, finding meaning and fulfillment by nurturing their talents and employing them to the benefit of their communities.  My own life amply demonstrates the tremendous different development can make in people’s lives, as it would have been unimaginable to study abroad in the US and pursue higher education just a few decades ago, when China was just emerging from the turmoil of deep social upheaval with a weakened economy under the state. Destitution is not destiny, and poor nations today can escape poverty with the right policies and implementation which aligns the incentives of all stakeholders in the pursuit of common prosperity. The desire to improve the lives of others through contributing to the fight against poverty, so that others too can realize their potentials and pursue a life of meaning and purpose, leads me to the doors of Harris, where I hope to spend the next two years in pursuit of my aspiration acquiring wisdom from professors who are first and foremost great humanitarians and at a university sharing my passion for improving the lives of others. The Harris community comprise the most brilliant minds drawn from all around the world, each passionate in their pursuit to make the world a better place, \nThe friends I make here will last long beyond graduation, and the opportunity to study alongside and learn from their diverse experiences while contributing my own will undoubtedly enrich my perspective.\n\nMy home country, China underwent an “economic miracle” over the past few decades which improved the lives of over a billion people, who now have greater opportunities to pursue a more meaningful and fulfilling life by developing their talents and deploying them to the benefit of their communities. Indeed, the chance to study in the US and pursue a postgraduate education was unthinkable only a few decades past, when a majority of the population were still enduring the indignities inflicted by poverty and struggling each day for mere survival, unable to educate themselves, discover passions, or access their capabilities as human beings. \n\nColumbia SIPA, a university that combines a world class education taught by renowned professors with a spirit of humanism that seeks to employ knowledge to the betterment of society. Its many initiatives seeking solutions to global policy challenges, such as the Center for Development Economics and Policy, and Center on Global Economy and Governance reflect the university’s public-facing mission and commitment to pursue knowledge not only for its own sake, but also to solve the pressing issues facing our world. \n\nComing from a nation whose past four decades of economic expansion has placed it as the second largest global economy, I am passionate about the cause of development, and understand firsthand the impact it can make on entire societies. What economic growth delivers to the poorest populations is more than merely higher per-capita incomes, but a restoration of their dignity, freedom from the suffering poverty inflicts, and greater opportunities and hope for the future. Indeed, it is only because of the incredible growth in living standards in China that I have the opportunity to study abroad and pursue higher education at the best universities in the world. It is for this reason that I hope to attain the skills and knowledge necessary to address global poverty through informed and sound development policies. It is not for lack of resources or wealth that poverty persists today, but the failure to implement development policies informed by a nation’s competitive advantages and aligning the incentives of the various stakeholders that explains some nation’s failures to grow their economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome view the march of history as propelled by a singular figure- Alexander the Great, or Napoleon-who, by sheer force of will, bends the world to their commands. Others, such as Leo Tolstoy, believe that history is shaped by the collective actions of ordinary people, each with their own motives,values, and beliefs that shape their actions. The truth, I believe, is somewhere in between.\n\nThe decisions of a few key individuals holding power often do shape the course of history, but the impact of their policies are determined by the responses of ordinary people to the policy. \n\nMy own country, China, experienced an economic miracle which saw it emerge from a destitute and isolated socialist state during the Cold War, to become a major economic powerhouse second only to the US and an integral part of the globalized world order over a few decades. Such a transformation began with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, who unleashed the energies and ingenuity of over a billion people to chase their own fortunes in the newly liberalized market economy. Their collective efforts are what lay behind the unprecedented growth which lifted many ordinary citizens out of poverty and into the middle class. \n\nThe story of my country over the past few decades is what inspired my passion for public policy, for it demonstrates that miracles are indeed possible. Poverty and hunger, long the prevailing condition throughout human history, are no longer inevitable tragedies in the present age of unprecedented material abundance, as informed policies and propert implementation offer hope to the world’s marginalized populations of a better tomorrow. At the Harris School, I hope to attain an understanding of how such magic transformations are possible, and how the use of policies can be applied to other global challenges of today’s world. What is unique to the Harris School is its combination of a rigorous curriculum emphasizing quantitative analysis and a scientific approach to policymaking and its humanistic pursuit of improving societies and human well-being.\nThe professors here possess decades of experience in policy matters spanning academia, the public and private sectors, and NGOs, and have an intimate understanding of the nuances and practicalities of policy planning. Harris’s curriculum furthermore provides students with the quantitative skills and familiarity with the latest research methodologies, such as randomized controlled experiments and difference in differences analysis, that enable them to become effective policy makers and leaders in the future. \n\nI hope to use the skills and knowledge I receive during my time at Harris to address the myriad challenges confronting our world today, and to enable impoverished peoples around the world to attain greater possibilities and hope for their future. Apart from its economic costs, poverty exacts a toll in lost opportunities and hopes unfulfilled. By using policy to address the basic needs of all people, we enable them to make full use of their potential and enjoy the full variety of the human experience. This, I believe, is the fundamental motivation for policy and economics- as a tool of human liberation which frees people from the basic material constraints needed to sustain life, and to enable them to achieve more and lead more fulfilling live, improving their societies in the process. \n\nSituated near the South Side of Chicago, the University of Chicago has a long history of working to improve the conditions of the neediest people of the city. Many professors conduct research in these neighborhoods to better understand the conditions of the people living there, and how policy may be conducted to help imrpove their lives. Such programs embody the motto of Harris, “Social Impact, Down to a Science,” and speak to its public facing mission of using research to drive real world changes both on a local and a global level. The students at Harris come from all corners of the world, motivated to use the knowledge the gain here to help their native countries, and nothing excites me more than to study alongside and learn from them, sharing my experiences with them, and learning from their perspective. I am confident that my person experiences, as well as my undergraduate education in Economics at the University of California, San Diego, have prepared me for academically rigorous yet exciting education at the Harris School of Public Policy",

    "jobDescription" : "My name is Roger Lin, and I am a Master of Public Policy candidate at the University of Chicago's Harris School, specializing in Finance and Policy. Since starting graduate school, my focus has been on building a strong quantitative and analytical toolkit applicable to both finance and policy challenges.\n\nMy coursework at Harris and the Booth School of Business has been rigorous and directly relevant to finance roles. In Corporate Finance, I learned foundational principles of valuation, capital budgeting, and financial decision-making, crucial for understanding how firms operate and create value. Financial Instruments was a deep dive into the world of derivatives – options, futures, swaps – covering pricing models like Black-Scholes and numerical methods. This course went beyond theory to practical application, using market data for implied volatility calculations and strategy analysis. Fixed Income Asset Pricing provided a detailed understanding of bond markets and interest rate modeling. A key project in this course involved extracting real and nominal yield curves from bond data using Python and techniques like cubic spline interpolation and the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model. I then used these curves to price Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and design interest rate hedging strategies. This hands-on project significantly strengthened my skills in data manipulation, quantitative modeling, and Python programming. Bank Regulation and Management, taught in part by former regulators, offered insights into the practicalities of banking supervision and risk management, going beyond textbook theory. Finally, Macroeconomic Policymaking, Financial Markets and Institutions provided a high-level understanding of monetary and fiscal policy, and the interactions between macroeconomic forces and financial markets, taught by faculty with real-world policy experience. Across these courses, the emphasis has been on both theoretical foundations and practical application using data and quantitative methods.\n\nBeyond coursework, my experiences have further refined these skills. As a Research Assistant at the Becker Friedman Institute, I worked on a project analyzing the relationship between inflation and equity returns. The goal was to understand how different inflation regimes impact asset class performance. My work involved compiling and cleaning over 50 years of data on inflation, stock valuations, and bond yields. I ran regressions to analyze correlations, created data visualizations to illustrate trends, and reviewed academic literature on the topic. This experience taught me the rigor of academic research, the importance of data quality, and how to communicate complex findings clearly.\n\nIn the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program, I gained practical experience in financial modeling for risk assessment. I analyzed customer loan data to predict Probability of Default (PD). I built predictive models using logistic regression and decision tree classifiers in Python, achieving high ROC AUC scores, which are metrics for evaluating model accuracy. This involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Python libraries like scikit-learn and pandas. I also designed dynamic programming algorithms to optimize FICO score categorization for better default prediction accuracy. This program provided a focused, hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to real-world financial problems.\n\nFurthermore, my participation in the International Strategic Crisis Negotiation Exercise (ISCNE) honed my strategic thinking and negotiation skills in a policy context. As a leader representing delegations in simulated international crises, I developed strategic frameworks, engaged in diplomacy with other nations, and worked to mediate competing interests. This exercise highlighted the importance of strategic planning, clear communication, and understanding different perspectives in complex policy situations.\n\nMy graduate education has equipped me with a strong foundation in quantitative finance and policy analysis, supported by practical experiences in research, financial modeling, and strategic negotiation. I am proficient in Python, R, and Stata and eager to apply these skills in analytically demanding roles in financial markets or policy-related fields. Personally, I am driven by intellectual curiosity, which is reflected in my interest in reading philosophy and economics. I also value discipline and exploration, which I pursue through running and experiencing diverse cuisines. I aim to be a reliable and thoughtful individual who can apply rigorous thinking to solve practical problems.",
