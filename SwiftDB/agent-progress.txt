## Project Overview
This project analyzes Apple sample code to extract valuable insights for macOS app development, focusing on architecture patterns, SwiftUI best practices, SwiftData integration, and native macOS controls.

## Session Log

### Session: 2025-01-22 - TipKit Sample Analysis
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-22 12:00:00 PST
**Branch**: main
**Feature Worked On**: TipKit sample code analysis and documentation
**Result**: All documentation completed successfully. Analysis provides comprehensive insights into Apple's TipKit implementation patterns and macOS app development best practices.

### Session: 2025-12-22 - Fruta + BookClub Sample Analysis
**Timestamp**: 2025-12-22 13:38:02 PST
**Branch**: main
**Feature Worked On**: Fruta and BookClub sample code analysis (multi-window, navigation, UI polish)
**Result**: Documentation updated successfully with new patterns and evidence paths.

### Session: 2025-12-22 - Comprehensive 25-App Deep Dive
**Timestamp**: 2025-12-22 22:05:00 PST
**Branch**: main
**Feature Worked On**: Massive expansion of `gemini-swift-exploration.md`.
**Summary of Changes**:
- Completed the goal of studying 25+ Apple Sample Projects.
- Replaced the initial summary with a detailed, 1500+ line technical blueprint (`gemini-swift-exploration.md`).
- Extracted exact implementation patterns for Metal, SwiftData, App Intents, WritingTools, and more.
- Updated `handoff.md` to transition from "Study" to "Build".

**Files Touched**:
- `gemini-swift-exploration.md`: Rewritten completely with high-density technical content.
- `handoff.md`: Updated to "Build Phase Ready".

**Tests Run**: Verified file content generation.
**Result**: The knowledge base is now production-ready. We have specific, copy-pasteable patterns for every major subsystem of the target application.

**Next Steps**:
- Initialize the "SwiftShowcase" Xcode project.
- Implement the "Skeleton" (Sidebar + WindowGroup).
