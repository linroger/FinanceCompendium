# SwiftDB Agent Progress Log

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Apple sample code to extract valuable insights for macOS app development, focusing on architecture patterns, SwiftUI best practices, SwiftData integration, and native macOS controls.

## Session Log

### Session: 2025-01-22 - TipKit Sample Analysis
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-22 12:00:00 PST
**Branch**: main
**Feature Worked On**: TipKit sample code analysis and documentation

**Summary of Changes**:
- Analyzed the complete TipKit sample project structure
- Studied all example implementations (inline, popover, parameter rules, event rules, actions, options, combo rules)
- Documented comprehensive insights in LEARNINGS.md (added ~600 lines of detailed analysis)
- Created structured OpenCode-SWIFTDB.md with code examples and references
- Established project harness with feature_list.json and agent-progress.txt

**Files Touched**:
- LEARNINGS.md: Added detailed TipKit analysis section
- OpenCode-SWIFTDB.md: Created new file with structured insights and code examples
- feature_list.json: Created project feature tracking
- agent-progress.txt: Created this progress log

**Tests Run**: None (documentation/analysis task)
**Result**: All documentation completed successfully. Analysis provides comprehensive insights into Apple's TipKit implementation patterns and macOS app development best practices.

**Next Steps**:
- Consider analyzing additional Apple sample projects for more insights
- Could implement a TipKit integration example in a real project
- May want to create automated tests for the documented patterns
